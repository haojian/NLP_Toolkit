It was SUCH a long wait, but it was worth it. We had french toast and pancakes with guava mimosas! great food and service. I guess it's the wait that'll make me hesitate from wanting to go here...

I have eaten here multiple times now for breakfast and brunch, and it has always been a pleasure. The grits are amazing, the beignets (especially the crawfish) are delightful, and the pecan syrup on those pancakes is literally to die for delicious. My boyfriend and I would steal bites from each other, so I have been lucky to try a lot of things off this menu ... I haven't had a thing I don't like yet! Also, they have a chicory flavored coffee they sell there in ground pounds which is very good, although I can't have too much of it haha.

Stumbled upon this place for lunch on the way to see the terracotta warriors. What a great find. Half hour wait to gen in but when there the service was fans and attentive. Can't wait to have an excuse to go back there as I had at least 5 plates I wanted to try but could only chose 1!

The only place we ate on our 24 hour trip to SF was Brenda's. And we were extremely happy that it was. Luckily we came before the rush (can't you tell we always eat early) on a Saturday night. My only gripe about this place was the waitresses. They were a little snotty and didn't seem like they wanted to be there at all. Thank goodness for their food because it made up for the bad service. We tried the crawfish beignets, the shrimp poboy,, and the mac cheese. Oh the mac and cheese! I think we should have ordered two big orders because it was simply amazing. The crawfish beignets are huge, with a little kick, which is a nice addition to the meal. The shrimp po boy could not have gotten better. The sauce they use, along with the bread was delicious. Oh and the watermelon iced tea. Holy moly!!!! Refreshing and tasty. What more can you want. I mean if all the raves and praises about this place don't push you to try this place, then just look at a picture of the mac and cheese. I'm sure that finally might.

It's alright, nothing special to go out of your way for. Do not take your date here though, she will fall if she's wearing heels as this floor is over waxed! I think my girl friend, her boyfriend and I went here on a bad night. It just all seemed over rated and over priced. We were unimpressed with the amount of food for the price. She got 2 ribs for $15 but it was too tough for her teeth. It also had too much sauce. My po boy oyster sandwich was okay but again, soaking in sauce. The bread was just gooey and gross to look at. At most it should be $8 and not $12. I do not think we will go out of our way again to eat here. It just doesn't seem worth the experience.

Been here a few more times after my original review. I know!! In such a short span. I really need to branch out in my foodie adventures, but the last few times in the city, shrimp and grits is all I've craved!! This last time, my fellow foodie friend and I arrived a little after 3PM. WAY after the crazy brunch rush and scored a parking spot right in front AND no wait to be seated! SCORE! However, they had an in between menu from 3PM-5PM, no specials. BUT they still had shrimp and grits. Hollaaaaa :) So, between the two of us, we ordered: Shrimp and grits, their shrimp po'boy sandwich with extra grits, the beignet platter, and their cornbread. Nomnomerz! We pretty much devoured most of the food. I know, us girls work hard, work out harder, but can still pack the heat out side the kitchen and into our food lovin' bellies. And with satisfied bellies we did. Oh, and the watermelon ice tea was also very refreshing. Not too sweet, just the way I like it! I must say, coming here without the rush definitely made the beignets taste so much better! I think it's cause they had more time to make these little suckers, but oh man, they were SO freakin' yummy this time around! My favorite is still the chocolate with the original and apple close contenders. The crawfish is still really good, but something with me and the idea of beignets as dessert turned into something savory has never been something that made my mouth water. Still good though don't get me wrong! But for now Brenda's, I bid you adieu as there are other SF establishments that require my taste bud a'tasting services.

I have been to Brenda's multiple times. Their services have always been wonderful. This is a great spot for a weekend brunch. If you do decide to go there, make sure you are okay with waiting. They always have a fairly long wait for seating. Parking is difficult, as it is street parking with meters. When it comes to the food, their Benedict and beignets are my favs. I never tried their watermelon tea as I am highly allergic but many do say they are great.

I've never tried French Soul food and to me that is more than enough reason to try it. My friends and I were in town on vacation and this place seemed very welcoming. Once you walk in, you see a chalk board to your right. This is where you write your name and number of ppl in your party. Only 4 people ahead of us and it seemed to move fairly quickly. Once seated we ordered our drinks (Abita Jockamo IPA). Crawfish Beignets as appetizer were amazing. Cayenne sprinkled on top and soft center of crawfish was a great combination. I ordered the smothered pork chops off the Specials menu, which is located adjacent to the chalk board where you write your name. They came smothered in Gravy with green beans and mashed potatoes on the side. If the small and tight seating arrangements were a bit more comfortable then I would've gave a perfect score. Only a small inconvenience for a great meal.

GREAT brunch spot! Food:  Crawfish Beignet all the way!  So savory and succulent; light and fluffy flour surrounding the crawfish.  Yum.  The Hangtown Fry with crispy oyster, bacon & scallion eggs is divine paired with the cheesy grits.  I'm originally from the South, so I know grits and biscuits.  Believe me -- Brenda's is the best I've had so far. Service:  pretty good.  Kept my watermelon ice tea full the entire time.  Took a little while to give me my check, but otherwise, on point. Tip:  Don't go during peak brunch hours!

Arrived at 1PM on a Wednesday afternoon and was surprised to see there was no wait.  Score!  Skimming the menu, we realized we needed to be strategic in order to try as many of the tasty things as two Asian girls could fit in their bellies with no leftovers. First on the list, crawfish beignets are a MUST!!!!  You can never go wrong with fried dough, but stuff that sucker with a rich cheddar sauce, green onions and crawfish and now you're in beignet heaven! Next was a cream biscuit and country sausage gravy, delicious!  The biscuit was super flaky with a nice moist interior and the gravy was super rich and laden with bacon.. yes bacon AND sausage, double win.   Up next was the catfish po'boy, the best I've ever had.  Yes I've been to NOLA and this was hands down the best.  The bread was toasted to perfection.  The fish had the perfect amount of cornmeal crust and was nicely seasoned.  The watermelon pickles on the side were a nice touch and super tasty as well. We left fat and happy and didn't even feel bad we didn't have room for dessert...I'd take a crawfish beignet any day over the sweet stuff.

Putting the soul in French food as far as I'm concerned! i tried biscuits with a  side order of gravy and a craw-fish beignet. Both were probably the top 3 I've had in their category. + Delicious + Not too pricey + Good service + Loved menu selections - Lines and wait during peak hours - Menus are segmented during day - Area is okay I would love to come back and try more. If you order take-out, order by phone and pickup to avoid lines!

Shrimp and grits. Cream biscuit. Plain beignets. Crawfish beignets. These are the things that you should get. I wish watermelon was in season so I could try their watermelon iced tea but that will come in time. A lot of people seem to have complained about the cheddar grits being "greasy" but that's what happens when you melt cheese. They weren't greasy at all! The shrimp and grits were so delicious. The grits were creamy and perfect, the cheese was cheddary and the shrimp was tasty. Cream biscuits were fluffy and yummy (nothing spectacular but if you like biscuits like I do, this is a good bet to eat with their homemade jam). The plain beignets are fluffy and have great texture. The crawfish beignet was something to try once but I don't think I'd get it again. I was expecting something packed with flavor but it was kind of bland, with the exception of the spicy cayenne pepper on top. Some friends and the Husband and I were meeting up for brunch because I've wanted to try Brenda's for a while. We got there at around 10:30 and there were about 20 groups in front of us. You put your name down inside on a huge chalkboard and then hang around. I estimated about an hour and I was right. The line actually moves pretty fast. Brenda's is a decently-sized place. I'd recommend heading over to Philz on Van Ness for some coffee. Walk leisurely, get your coffee and walk leisurely back. By the time you finish your coffee, the wait will only be another 15 minutes or so. Finish your drink before you go inside. Brenda's doesn't like it if you have food items from another place. We spent around 65 total for four people, including tax and tip, at brunch. Not bad considering that all of us walked out holding our stomachs and groaning with take-home boxes in our hands.

So, I came back and ordered the same thing! Enjoyed the Shrimp & Grits better without the cheese... love the tomato-bacon gravy! A poached egg was just the right accompaniment. I tried a friends biscuit and damn they were good!!! Five stars for food! So why the 4 stars? I think they should improve there waiting list procedures. With all the business they have, they could invest in some technology! I was a bit irritated when the large party right before us got seated before us even though they had been called repeatedly, didn't answer and were removed from the list. Also, the guy at the front could crack a smile or maybe exude the smallest amount of warmth... just a bit of southern hospitality would make the wait seem more bearable. Hey, HE might even enjoy his job a little if he was nice to people.   Three stars for service!

Been in SF for almost two years and just found this place that is less then a black from my office.  I was having a late lunch but decided on a Kate brunch and had the pecan French toast.  They were delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.

Fantastic atmosphere though a bit of a there's-no-other-options-here-except-Brenda's location...So once you're there, you are committed to Brenda's as a brunch destination.  Yes, the beignets are fantastic-- highly recommend getting the sampler.  The mains, however, did not meet expectations.  I had the veggie omelet, and it was not obviously not the way to go.  Definitely recommend going with a small group because it can be quite a wait.  We got lucky and grabbed a couple spots at the bar.

1)Both the catfish and oyster po'boys were delicious, as we're the sweet potato dumplings. 2)The ribs, however, were EMBARASSINGLY BAD, and would lose in a contest even with a run-down Applebee's. 3)Both po'boys at our table came with fries that were also OFFENSIVELY BAD. We decided they must save on operating costs by harvesting their cold, hard, dry fries from a McDonald's dumpster. I kid you not. Although some of the food was great, the ribs and the fries were so bad that it makes me wonder how much management goes into keeping the kitchen on top of its game. For the rural Midwest this would be acceptable, but I wouldn't expect this place to last long in a city with so many incredible restaurants . I won't be going back again. Just not with the risk when half the food is good and the other have is almost offensive. Seriously. Yelp has you at the top of the list and you produce terrible food to people? You could tell the fries AND ribs would be dry and awful by looking at them, yet they came right out of the kitchen like it was an everyday occurence. Shame on you, Brenda's French Soul Food.

Brenda's is located in a shady area of the city, but they make a mean breakfast/brunch! The restaurant is about a mid-size restaurant that looks like it can fit around 40 people inside. The wait for this place is CRAZY! It took roughly an hour to get a table. For first timers, there's a chalk board on the inside they use as a waiting list. Be sure to write down your name and the number in your party. There's a bench on the outside to sit on while waiting. If you're looking for this place, just look for the huge crowd of people waiting outside. Can't miss it. == Food == Flight of Beignets comes with one of each beignets they have there. Chocolate, plain, apple, and crawlfish. The chocolate is just too much chocolate. The apple one tastes like an apple pie. Plain one tastes like a regular doughnut. The crawlfish is the best one of them all and definitely recommended! I would not suggest getting the flight for a party smaller than four. It'll turn out to be a lot of food to finish. Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict is amazing! One of the lunch specials that they had when I went there. The poached eggs are made nicely. The pulled pork was really soft and tender. They used a right amount of sauce. It wasn't drenched in sauce, but just enough to make the eggs and every taste good. Watermelon Tea. What's so special about this... tastes like tea with a hint of watermelon. It was alright... == Service == Even though this place is busy, the waiter kept everything pretty much under control. The watermelon tea was replenish whenever it was getting low. He came by and checked up on things every so often. Service was great overall! == Overall == The food is pretty amazing, but the long wait for a table doesn't really justify the wait. It's a nice place to go through once in a while with friends or on a date, but not a place you would frequent every morning.

Amazing food at a reasonable price! Came here for dinner, and we got there around 6pm on a weekday, so there wasn't a wait. It did however get crowded later on in the evening, and since they don't take reservations, plan to get there early! Their menu isn't too extensive, but it's got a touch of everything southern. My favorite are the crawfish beignets. They're pretty unique, and very tasty! I haven't had a chance to try their other assortment of beignets (other than the original - which was also very good) but I plan to come back and try! We also tried their bbq ribs, which were good, but not amazing. I'm hoping to come back for brunch sometime to try their breakfast fare. Finally, I LOVE their watermelon sweet tea! And they have free refills! I swear I probably drank 3 glasses throughout my dinner there. 5 stars just for the tea haha.

Best breakfast I've had in SF in a while.  I had the Hangtown Fry (eggs, oysters,  bacon).  It was perfect.  The oyster were cooked just right.   I normally don't like grits, but I guess I just hadn't had the right ones because the grits on the side were great and complemented the fry. Next time I'm trying the Beignets.  That looked like the goto item there.

Both the breakfast and lunch here are crazy delicious! For breakfast and lunch I have tried the goat cheese & shrimp omelette, crawfish beignets, clam fry with grits and their shrimp po'boy for which all seem to fit the theme of soul food that is super heavy and fried, but sooo friggen tasty. The plain beignets (French-inspired fried doughnuts) are worth ordering a bunch and bringing to friends. When I did this I only received positive reviews from the smiling faces of what looked to be a bunch of hungry CRACK addicts. (They pile on plenty of powdered sugar on those babies.) TIP #1: If you're eating in, don't forget that the watermelon iced tea is bottomless! Perfect for if you order the somewhat spicy crawfish beignets on a hot day. TIP #2: You can save so much time during the crowded lunch rush by ordering the food to-go here. Walk things down to Civic Center Plaza and eat outside if the TL's sidewalks don't suit your tastes. This place gets packed right from when they open, so plan accordingly.

As I crossed the street toward Brenda's I saw a line that went around the corner and then some, and thought, "AW SHEEEEEEET" (and not the good kind). This would be my 3rd attempt at eating here without a 2 hour long wait. So, backup plan (always have a backup, even if it is saltine crackers that have been crushed by sitting on them) in my pocket: order to go. Crawfish beignets, cheese grits, cream biscuits, hash, the Hangtown Fry (crispy oyster, bacon, scallion scramble), Egg & Bacon Tartine...this was my TO GO order on our way to Napa. I think this was quite possibly the most delicious drive I've ever had. To coast on a drive with Brenda's cheese grits melting in your mouth...that's somethin' else. With 3 chalkboards worth of names willing to wait 2+ hours for a table, I think Brenda's has definitely earned its culinary street cred. Even my order took about 30-45 minutes, but it was well worth it. This is your true blue southern brunch at its best. It's the right amount of crunchy, buttery, savory... I still don't know that I could wait 2 hours to get a table here, but eating at Brenda's is like a giant Southern cream biscuit hugging your stomach and stroking / soothing you with an oversized strip of crispy bacon. Insert the Homer Simpson drool noise here.

Utterly satisfying, and incredibly convenient for an early breakfast in central San Francisco. My companion and I had been planning to go to Plow but were short on time, and were incredibly lucky to remember this place, which had been on both of our lists for a long time. We had the flight of beignets (plain, chocolate, apple were all best of breed, but the crayfish beignet was the surprise hit: crunchy on the outside, full of perfectly cooked meat in a creamy, spicy sauce) and a special (pork belly with grits); that was more than enough for two people, so we didn't need the (archetypal but otherwise unremarkable) side of andouille sausage that we also ordered. I'm one of those people who finds it hard to get excited about cornmeal, but these grits were otherworldly. Service was fast (important for a rushed morning breakfast) and friendly; the restaurant itself is relatively spacious, bright, and generally a good place to start the day. I'm planning to come back for evening fare at some point soon. Can't wait.

Cute spot for brunch. There is always a little wait. The inside is very nice, totally not what you'd expect. Skylights and the decor makes you want to dress cute, this is not a breakfast diner! So the food is ok, I had the crispy pork belly with grits and although good, it was mostly just fat.. I had pork belly before and it's not lean, but I wasn't expecting 90% of it to be PURE fat. The service is just ok, only one girl really gave us that New Orleans charm. Brunch says it is all day but I think at least on the weekend it ends strictly at 3pm.. Which good thing we called or we would of missed it. You get in and you have to write your name down on the chalk board and your whole party must be present before they even seat you. So don't bother putting your name down while your friend finds parking. I been here once and I would most likely come again, this place is pretty unique for the city. Not a whole lot of real soul food places in SF I feel.

Apparently everyone has been to Brenda's except me! Well now I am part of this elite crowd that has experienced this delicious goodness.  We started off our meal with the flight of beignets. The flight included four beignets filled with apples, chocolate, plain, and crawfish. I enjoyed them all except I really enjoyed the crawfish one the most. While the beignets were good, I still think Cafe Du Monde in NOLA is better. I ordered the catfish po boy.  Another person in our group ordered the oyster po boy so I was able to try that too.  Both the catfish and oyster po boy were delicious.  The batter that it was fried in was flavorful and crispy.  Their aioli sauce on the sandwich was also super yummie. I was also able to try the shrimp and grits. Really good stuff with good flavor. The only problem is the greasiness from the cheese. But it is ALL WORTH IT! The portion size here was pretty good. You get a lot for your money. I'm always a fan of that! The service here was attentive and fast.  This was important to us because half our group had a flight to catch out of SFO immediately after the meal was over. I'm glad were able to sneak this meal in! The entire party must be present to be seated.  Thankfully there was a little bit of a wait before our party of 6 was called. Make sure to place your name on their chalkboard.  There is usually a wait. There's some street parking available at $3.00 an hour. Make sure to bring those quarters! I forget how expensive SF is.  Their meters are not really tourist friendly either because the meters do not take credit cards. I can't wait to sneak in another visit to Brenda's next time I'm back in SF!

Brenda's was a huge disappointment, like when the Niners had 1st and goal from the 7 to win the Superbowl and couldn't punch it in... yeah that disappointing. New Orleans is my favorite city in the U.S., so anytime a restaurant offers a taste of the Crescent City I can't wait to dig in. The beignet flight sounded amazing on the menu, but sadly they turned out to be far less exciting once you bite into them. The flavors are very pedestrian and lacked the large chunks of crawfish I was expecting. The watermelon ice tea is one of their trademarks, but the flavor tasted off. Nothing about the meal reminded me of nights in the French Quarter. I wanted to love Brenda's, but I quickly realized getting my hopes up was a mistake. From now on I'll stick to eating Cajun food in New Orleans and hopefully drown my sorrows in authentic Cajun cuisine ... you live and you learn.

This place is bordering on greatness. The line for brunch is standard purgatory and worth it if you can make an hour of good conversation. The staff are quite friendly and very good about clearing plates, which was a necessity given the amount that we ordered. Crayfish beignets: beignet is somewhat of a misnomer if you're looking for a slightly delicate fried delicacy, as this is more like a mini-boulder of fried almost-bread encasing a gooey mixture of cheese, scallions, and crayfish, dusted with paprika. This may sound contradictory but I'd say they are good but not quite delicious, and yet something I have no qualms about eating over and over again until I die, sort of like white rice. Crispy pork belly over cheesy grits with spicy onion relish: the pork belly is legit. The size of pork belly served is decent (although if you are going to order pork belly, when is there ever TOO MUCH pork belly?), the crisp is great while the meat is tender and flavorful. There just simply wasn't enough to go around for the sizeable platter of grits. Also, a biscuit would've been great (but that deserves its own section). Seafood frittata: the frittata is stuffed with a sizable amount of crayfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage. As the waitress noted in her recommendations, it is heavy (and that is after acknowledging that EVERYTHING here is heavy). Decent, but I'm not sure if there is much to say beyond that. Pulled pork benedict: sweet pulled pork with poached eggs over 2 half-biscuits. Sweet and slightly tangy, the egg is almost an afterthought (sacrilege, I know). It should've come with a side of cole slaw instead of potatoes/grits, the sheer quantity of carbs was overwhelming. This was probably the highlight entree for the 3 of us. Banana foster french toast: very standard french toast, with caramelized bananas that transferred over into the syrup which made the syrup stand-alone edible in it's own right. Served with a dollop of whipped cream, this was an appropriate dessert to this overwhelming meal. Biscuits: yes, this deserves it's own section. As my friend and I were remarking, the biscuits here were generally moist, not particularly flaky or buttery, but incredibly satisfying. If I could make my own entree, it would involve their crispy pork belly to make sandwiches and use their biscuits for bread, with a large bowl of sausage gravy for dipping. Overall, a solid meal just shy of spectacular. While there were no real flavor explosions, the taste combinations were generally harmonious. Perhaps the most amazing thing was that, in spite of the carnage that we wrought, I surprisingly didn't feel greased out later in the afternoon. In retrospect, nothing served was overly heavy on the oil/lard/butter, which speaks to the ability of the chef(s) to keep things as light as possible without losing the Cajun essence. So if you are looking to fill up with a hearty southern breakfast, you'll be hard-pressed to find another place where you'll definitely fill up and yet avoid feeling like a total fatty.

This place looks like a small hole in the wall joint, but dont be fooled by the outside appearance. As a matter of fact even the inside is small, but that doesnt matter, the food here is the real deal. Crayfish beignet, is a must try, crispy outside, soft inside with a creamy and tasty filling, plenty of pictures here to show you. I ordered the catfish po, which is basically a fried catfish inside a french roll, couldnt believe how good it was, as simple as it may sound. The catfish isnt oversalted like other places, and melts in your mouth forreals. Everyones dishes looked good, I dont think you can go wrong here. Management kind of seemed annoyed with our big group, because we had some people arrive late, but whatever i wont dock anything for that, because what really mattered was the food.

Believe the hype...Brenda's French Soul Food is amazing! The crawfish beignets stole the show, but don't get me wrong, everything was delish. I'll start off with the ambiance...beautiful fun yet romantic atmosphere. Waiters are very friendly. While you are waiting for your food, they will serve you some deep fried black eyed beans in some kind of seasoning. As for the dishes, we had the following: 1. crawfish beignet -  hands down a unique and flavorful dish. Crawfish in some creamy oozy sauce all in a perfectly fluffy yet crispy beignet. +2 star (should be a 5 star all on it's own =) 2. hush puppies - I'm typically not a fan of hush puppies, but Brenda's did it right and the chipotle sauce that comes with it is great. 3. oyster po'boy - One of the best oyster po'boy's I've had. It is served with a good amount of deep fried oysters on a toasty bun.  YUM! +1 star 4. . fried chicken - this was very good, but I hate to say it, I've had better. -1 star 5. shrimp in buttery spicy sauce - this was one of the specials they had that night. Unbelievably amazing!! Large, and I mean LARGE shrimp in plenty of spicy buttery sauce served with rice. I wish I could remember the name of the dish, but I think I was floating in air so much from eating it that I forgot the name of it. + 2 stars I love this place and will definitely be back!

I was a bit disappointed b/c I did not know they only served eggs benedicts on the weekends. I was looking forward to trying it. I really enjoyed their homemade granola pancakes with fresh fruit on top tho. So delish!  We also ordered the Top Flight beignets which had one plain, apple, chocolate and crawfish beignets. My fav out of the four was the crawfish beignet!!! A must try! Service was attentive and tables are very close together so you kinda have to squeeze in but food is yummy.

BEST FRENCH TOAST!! Was visiting from out of town and came here for breakfast with my wife on a recommendation from a friend and was thoroughly satisfied. We started off by ordering the plain Beignets which were ridiculously good. Nothing plain about them. Never had Beignets like this before. For my meal,  I ordered the French Toast with butter pecan sauce and it blew my mind! Suffice it to say it was the best French Toast I've had in my life! They use cinnamon battered brioche which is one of my favorite breads and it was absolutely perfect. My wife ordered the Shrimp and Grits which was really good too. This is a place you would expect to find in the French Quarter and they do it just as good as any restaurant there. Chef Brenda is from New Orleans and is true to her roots with the kinds of food she prepares. We left here stuffed and had left overs to spare. Very generous portions along with reasonable prices make this place a true Gem in a city full of amazing restaurants. Atmosphere is casual and relaxing so you can take your time enjoying your meal, although it may be hard to find a seat during their busy hours.

Excellent food. I had the Three Egg Omelet with bell peppers and sausage, grits that tasted EXACTLY like the ones I had as a kid with the butter already in them (Step-grandpa who raised me was from NOLA), a HUGE biscuit and the coffee (though I don't like chickery) was excellent as the chickery didn't overwhelm the coffee. Wife had the banana's french toast and coffee which I sampled as well and found it absolutely delicious! The only downside is that you better get there early and by early I don't mean sometime before 11 (we were there at 10!), I mean early as in when they open! That's if you want to eat fairly soon. We had to wait over an hour to get in. However, here's what we did... you sign in on a black board and after we did that we asked how long before we would be seated. The guy told us an hour. Okay. We said we'd be back then and proceeded to run errands, then came back an hour later, checked with the the waiter and we had roughly 3-5 minutes to wait. Perfect! I'll most definitely will go back only a lot earlier.

I found it funny that a woman a few tables down asked what are some light options. I have to say this is not the place for you if you are on a diet. It's comfort food - wonderful, gut-busting delicious food. A tip for those who have the time, if you are going for the lunch hour during the week it is best to go around 2 pm. It really quiets down. With that said, my husband and I came in around 1:15 and were sat rather quickly. The restaurant definitely reminds me of restaurants back in New Orleans. If you are looking for an experience that is similar to the old restaurant institutions back on the Bayou, this is it. We had the fried oysters, I would definitely suggest it. I had the shrimp grits, but I think next time I will just order a side of grits as the flavors were too much for me. Hubby had the fried chicken and those delicious cream biscuits. Definitely get a biscuit, but you can easily split it between two people. We were so full we couldn't eat another bite, so next time we will try the beignets and one of the po' boys.

Do I reallly need to add another review to the 3351 reviews already telling you to eat at Brenda's? If you're reading this review to decide whether you should go or not then ---- Yes.. I do. I went on a weekday afternoon, around 12:30pm? The wait wasn't too bad, roughly 15-20 minutes, which is amazing since the whole place was packed. Parking wasn't  bad, found parking about a block away, had to feed the meter the whole 2 hour limit just incase, but it's not bad for the great food. Among my bf and I, we wanted everything. We ordered their crawfish beignet (of course), a deeeelicious biscuit (which i was craving), their porkbelly and grits (special for that day?), and a bowl of gumbo. This was definitely not a good idea because we had way more than we could eat, but it was well worth it since we were able to taste a little bit of everything. Bf loved the gumbo and porkbelly, i loved the grits and biscuit, we both devoured the beignets. besides the good food, portions we're pretty large which is definitely a plus! service was prompt, super friendly, and attentive even though they we're all running around like crazy trying to serve the mass of people in the restaurant. Overall, I can't wait for brunch at Brenda's again :) definitely gonna try their other beignets!

This place doesn't take reservations and the wait can be ~45 minutes, but the cashier is very nice about giving quarters for the meter and the food is so worth it!!! I've tried all the beignets (yes I'm a fat girl on a mission) and the crawfish is hands down the best. I also got the King Cake beignet which the menu says comes with "a little baby Jesus" and I was not disappointed. Unfortunately I forgot to take him home with me so he's probably being recycled...forgive me, Jesus. I've had the fried chicken eggs Benedict and thought the chicken was pretty dry. The pulled pork eggs Benedict I ordered yesterday though was HEAVEN ON EARTH. It will haunt my dreams.

Wow Wow WoW.... This place is legit. Excellent food and a friendly staff. The food is aaaaMAZING!!. Try the okra gumbo and the fried chicken. The fried chicken is fried hard and juicy. The batter of the chicken is so flavorful I will definitely go back to enjoy some more. The biscuits are soft and just enough butter to make the taste bud go crazy.. All the other items on the menu looked just as tempting. The breakfast portion is generous. SO go here to try this place at least once.... OR twice.. you won't regret it. It will change your life. Hearty place for food, but it'll make your stomach feel good.

I'd like to meet Brenda, and personally thank her for such marvelous food.   Granted - it's a small establishment.  That makes me sad.  Because I know the lines get really long and there are people outside staring at the people inside who are enjoying their Brenda's deliciousness.   I've only been here for dinner - but I'm making a trip for Brunch this weekend...  For dinner we started off with a Crayfish Beignet.  It was good... but there was only one and I had to share with my BF.  I offered him another bite of mine because he liked it so much.  He took my half and ate the whole thing... I was merely offering him a bite!  next time... no sharing.   We then had the oyster sampler. The waitress was great, recommended which directly we should eat them so as to avoid mixing the flavor profiles too much.   I had Brenda's friend chicken with biscuits and greens.  My BF had the cheesy shrimp and grits.  First off - I'm not a biscuits and greens fan.  But when I got my plate, I only ate the greens and the biscuit for a good 10 bites before I even touched the chicken. It was that good.  shrimp and grits were delicious.  Cheesy, shrimp was  seasoned so well... it was just so good!   They say the lines get long, but when we were there on a Friday the other week we were seated right away.   Can't wait to go there for brunch!

Unlike most people (thank god) i did not come here for brunch and have to suffer through a crazy wait. I came here on a Monday or Tuesday for breakfast/lunch with a friend and got in and sat down without any wait. they even saved our table while we got change form them and fed the meter. I got some of my favorites at a soul food place: a bloody mary, shrimp n grits, and gumbo.  All were delicious. Not the best bloody mary ever, but solid, nothing special. The shrimp n grits were awesome though, loved those cheesy grits and those tasty shrimp. The gumbo was good, nothing adventurous or unique, like the one I had at The Front Porch in The Mission, but it was more of a traditional gumbo and was very tasty. The real standout for me though, was the crawfish beignet. We got the flight, but I don't remember the other ones much, just that these were so good. My friend had an allergic reaction to them (allergic to shellfish) and still said they were good. I definitely want to come back, but since it's tough to find someone to come with you on a weekday afternoon and my bf is adverse to driving to the TL to wait over an hour for brunch, especially with only pricey metered parking where a quarter is like 5 min or something, I fear I may not be able to come back unless they get a handle on the long wait situation on the weekends. This bums me out because I really want another beignet and shrimp n grits.

Came in at 10am on a Saturday and waited for 30 mins. Not too shabby. You write your name on a chalkboard with your party size and they won't seat you unless everyone's there. Flight of beignets - crawfish was definitely my favorite. The rest (apple, chocolate, plain) were good but nothing special. Hangtown fry - delicious and different. Fried oysters, bacon, and scallion, never thought this combo would work in a scramble but it does! Only complaint is that it's really dry. The highlight for me was the biscuit. Really soft, crumbles and melts in your mouth. Spread some brenda's homemade jam and you're good to go. Overall, good brunch spot but definitely wouldn't wait 2 hours for it.

I was totally in the mood for delicious soul food so naturally I was excited when I read about this place on Yelp.  I just had to dine here.  Needless to say I was quite pleased with my breakfast.  I had the Grillades & Grits which I thought was wonderful.  The menu states that it is one of their popular dishes.   Being a tourist, I was a bit apprehensive about coming into the Tenderloin district since the concierge at the hotel had tried dissuading us from setting foot in the district by saying "it's just not safe in there."  But I had to throw caution into the wind after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews.   Over all, I'm certainly glad I came.  I shall bookmark this place.

I fell in love with Brenda's a few years ago after one of those much-needed morning savory meals. The space was half its current size and the wait was 4 times as long. Not sure if that math makes sense, but the wait was worth it to experience the delicious Flight of Beignets, hangtown fry, and the fried chicken benedict. The meal was exceptionally memorable and I have been yearning to come back. During my most recent SF trip to visit family and friends, we were finally able to make it back. My excitement was like being a kid in Toys-R-Us. We went on a Friday morning right before the lunch rush and were able to be seated within 10 minutes.... Victory! I needed a few minutes to settle in, as I was overjoyed with happiness. They've really hooked up the space to give it an updated classic New Orleans feel. For our order, of course we went with the Flight of Beignets that we modified to consist of 3 beignets filled with dungeness crab (special for that day), crawfish, and apple. We wanted to re-live the previous dining experience but unfortunately the benedicts are only available during the weekend (sad face emoticon). But no worries, as we got the hangtown fry, and since I was feeling special, we ordered the pork belly and cheesy grits. The beignets were just as stellar as I remembered. They are one of San Francisco's best sweet and savory combinations that I've had. The hangtown fry was good, with oysters that were plump and plentiful, and bacon that added a smoky flavor. The pork belly cheesy grits were alright. I had high expectations but the dish just fell short. I expected the dish to completely harmonize and be better refined. In all, I'm so happy to have gotten reacquainted with Brenda's. It's definitely worth trying, especially for the savory brunch lovers. San Francisco is a food playground and the beignets are a must play. Crawfish Beignet - http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

As a vegetarian most of my life, I have never been into Southern food. Brenda's may singlehandedly help change that. Came here on a Sunday morning around 10:30am to immediate seating. Can you believe that?! I'm sure it was a fluke and people didn't want to sit at the bar but boy, was that a sign of good things to come. We ordered: - Veggie omelet with house potatoes and wheat toast (my scared of Southern food order) - so while a safe order, was surprisingly different from most omelets and quite good! The toast was amazinggg, so fresh and thick. - Bacon and cheddar omelet with grits and a biscuit - friend really enjoyed the omelet while I devoured his extras. The biscuit was... There are no words. Flaky, buttery and so delicious. - Sweet potato pancake with a maple glaze - this was an impulse order for sure but god, I'm glad we did. It was overly sweet in the best way possible. If you have a sweet tooth like me, GET THIS. Wonderfully patient waiters and service along with stellar food. I do understand why there is normally a line but worth checking out and you may get lucky with no wait!

We had breakfast at Brenda's on our last day in SF.   Ordered the chocolate beignet to start which was pretty good. My husband ordered the Grillades & Grits -- the grits was tasteless and beef cutlets was dry.  I ordered the special -- pull pork po'boy with fries, nothing great at all and the fries were like the frozen kind you can get at the supermarket. The service was slow but the waitress apologized twice because the kitchen was trying to fill a big take out order, we weren't in a rush so not a big deal. tourist beware:  if you're coming from union square, try to stay on Post Street and then make a right on Polk St.  we made the BIGGG mistake of walking through Ellis Street, you definitely want to stay away from this area!

Compared to other popular brunch hotspots in the SF, the wait for this was very reasonable at only half an hour though Philz Coffee around the corner certainly helped bide the time. All in all, the brunch fare was tasty and my enjoyment of it all was enhanced by the charming decor within. The eggs benedict (fried catfish) was one of the better dishes that I've had for brunch in the city, and it was all due to the fantastic, creamy hollandaise drizzled onto the perfectly poached eggs. We ordered the beignet flight, which comes with one each of their four menu offerings. Having a sweet tooth (or several), my preference leans toward the sweet beignets (specifically the apple) over the savory crawfish beignet which is a crowd favorite. All in all, I will absolutely be returning for another helping of benedict + beignet!

I heard so many good things about Brenda's since I moved in the city that I wanted to try it. However, I did not have a chance to go for brunch (yet), but "only" for dinner. I had the grits and shrimp, a very decent price and a LOT of food. One of the best quality/quantity/price ratio in the city. My friend had the special croque Monsieur with crab and loved it. Apparently, brunch is better... I might need a 6th star to update my review in that case! Actually went a second time to make sure it really deserves 5 stars, and it does. The spicy butter shrimp special was so yummy! On top of that, the staff is really friendly and welcoming. Recommending it with no hesitation and will go there again!

What more can I say that hasn't already been said? Well for 1- the beignets are still really good reheated in your microwave at home! This might be sacrilege to this institution, but I just couldn't finish all of them at the table! Also the waitresses might consider wearing hair nets... all of them have curly hair and I definitely spotted one in my coffee. GROSS. And when I asked for another cup she gave me an annoyed expression and I was worried she spit in my food for the rest of the meal. All in all, really great food. Service could use a bit of work.

Oh my god. I wish the wait wasn't so crazy on an average day because I'd come a lot more often. Come hungry because the portions are huge! They have many beignets to choose from and I found it a great little appetizer to start the brunch. We chose chocolate and they were stuffed with chocolate chips that were very warm and melty. I'd love to try the flight of beignets they offer. You can try one of each! Some plain, some savory, some sweet. One beignet and I was already starting to feel a bit full, but then the main course came out. I choose the oyster/bacon scramble with potatoes and opted for the biscuit instead of the toast. I wasn't even a quarter of the way threw before my stomach started pushing the limit. The only thing that wasn't stellar were the potatoes. Wish I would've opted for the grits as they looked divine. Best thing there-- the biscuits. They are cream biscuits, which I assume means using heavy cream instead of buttermilk when mixing. They are huge, REALLY moist, and so fluffy. If I could only eat those for the rest of my life I'd be a happy gal! Worst thing-- chicory in the coffee! Blergh. I am a black coffee drinker, so the bitterness of the chicory gets to me.

If I could rate Brenda's based on service, I would definitely give it 5 stars but the food wasn't 5 star worthy at all. At first, I was real excited to try out the place as my friends described Brenda's as "Louisiana/cajun with a French twist." Being intrigued by that statement, I was totally anticipating our visit. We ordered the crawfish beignets for starters and it was definitely different that's for sure! I'm use to the dessert beignets, but a savory beignet? The over-powering spice is what bothered me about this appetizer. The beignet was tasty especially with the crawfish, but the spice is what killed it. As much as I love a kick of spice, this was way too much! For my main dish, I ordered the shrimp & grits and holy cow was the portions huge! The dish was appetizing and filling. I love the biscuits and of course the watermelon tea! Overall, not a bad place but I don't know if I would come out of way to go here. The workers here are very friendly which is a plus, but the food was just average. Most memorable part of my dining experience? The buttery soft biscuits with a refreshing glass of iced watermelon tea.

Visited on Saturday around noon for brunch. Ordered beignet flight, pork belly & grits special, pulled pork benedict. First, ~45 minute wait for seating for 2 for brunch. Probably to be expected, but it sets up a certain level of expectation. Service felt rushed, probably also to be expected. Food was okay, but execution wasn't perfect. Poached eggs were undercooked, for instance, and the hash browns weren't crisp at all. I have family from the south. I've been eating real southern food for my whole life. Everything I had at Brenda's was... overdone. Too much butter, cheese, salt, etc., and that's saying a lot when you're talking about southern food. These dishes are overreaching, and with the problems in execution described above, it was lacking. This is Paula Deen's take on Emeril's take on brunch.

Heavenly breakfast place in the heart of the tenderloin district. Walking through the neighborhood was eye opening and at times uncomfortable but then we walked into this lovely french soul food breakfast diner, which we happened to stumble upon, and we were pleasantly surprised with first the decor, then the food. Items we loved: 1) The beignet flight of all the various beignets: plain, apple, chocolate, AND CRAWFISH, MY OH MY! The crawfish beignet was so unique, savory, and delicious! 2) The catfish eggs florentine. heavenly, heavenly!! 3) Banana French Toast- YUM what needed work: 1) our omelet wasn't properly cooked. The shreds of cheese were unmelted and needed some serious re-cooking. They remedied the situation though and brought back a properly cooked one 2) the hostess service. Waited for a bar table (because the table wait was like 1.5 hours) which we were told was first come first serve. After 30 mins of waiting, one finally became available, but then after the hostess seated us, the manager came and attempted to "unseat" us, saying that lone diners were given priority for the bar seats. Luckily for them, and their review, we were not "unseated" overall awesome brunch experience. one of my favorites. would love to go back!

Another update: I love these, don't you :) I think I need to enter a help group because I can see myself being dangerously addicted to Brenda's crawfish beignet...ABSOLUTE MUST! Yes, they are that good. I went again with my friend and she was raving about them, so I thought, hey, I like crawfish, why not? Good thing we got it too because I seriously want to spread the love! Also, this time around everyone was super attentive, which was really nice considering it ended up getting super busy, and that my friend was loving her Watermelon Ice Tea! Another thing that really just made my morning/day was that there was literally no line at all! Let me tell you, that is rare and amazing. You can tell how awesome this place is because of the line that constantly forms outside. Give Brenda's a go and get some crawfish beignets, it's an experience in itself!

Brenda's is, oddly enough, a testament to the density of San Francisco review content here (density related to volume): how a place might actually have the cajones to sidle up to the dining public that feels so confidently of its own fare, here bearing witness to some of the hallmarks of another great food town (let's call it New Orleans) is pretty interesting. And moreso because they take on the mantle well. Brenda's comes strong with the French Soul Food vibe, and having spent lots of time and recent time in both cities, I'd say they nail it quite well. There will always be some interesting parallels between creative and historic food elements in both cities, and this restaurant (in my experience) didn't at all play like a copy of a copy. They're clearly creating foodstuffs that they love with an homage to the Big Easy. Bully for the rest of us. Know that if you're walking here you'll head through what appeared to be some dodgy bits of town, but once inside, especially on a bright weekday morning, the place filled with natural light and eager conversation, the slender, shotgun room resonated. On this morning, it was three thick slices of French Toast, cinnamon-battered brioche with butter pecan sauce. And if that doesn't taste like sunrise over the Delta then perhaps nothing does. I'm not in the city as often as I once was, but Brenda's is worth a special stop.

Holy cow, this place is awesome! And I'm saying this after an almost hour-long wait. Everything tasted like I thought it should taste. There's just something so comforting and fun about New Orleans food. The traditional beignets were piping-hot-out-of-the-oven-amazing. They were huge, but incredibly light and airy. And even though you'll probably get powdered sugar everywhere, you won't care. The beignets will melt in your mouth and you'll be a happy puddle. The joy just kept on coming. The watermelon sweet tea was refreshing and the cream biscuit tasted like it was made by someone's grandmother who's been baking for fifty years. The pork belly was lip-smacking and the gumbo was delicious. I highly recommend the grillade gravy. My hubby kept sneaking his biscuit over to soak up the sauce. Nothing disappointed. Hubby was just moaning how he wished we had bought more biscuits home.

Beignets with chocolate, crawfish and apple cinnamon are simply foodgasmic. Grits in drawn butter will have you in heaven. Their biscuits are pillows of Buttery goodness and their omelette And pork sausages are simply delicious. Have the watermelon iced tea.

i came with a group of my friends and the food was amazing !!! W got the beignets platter with all the flavors. I personally like the chocolate one but they were all amazing. I would choose that as an appetizer and get a meal because it is very sweet. I got the jambalaya that was the special of the day and my friend that i shared with got something with pork belly and it was amazing. It had eggs in it and the pork belly was crispy and to die for. i would definitely come back, i wanted to try the eggs benedict but we came on a thursday and apparently only sold it on the weekends. I would recommend this place to all of my friends who came to sd. The food was decently priced and the food and service was good.

Beignet flight- amazing. Fried catfish eggs benedict- the catfish is so good, but the biscuit is so heavy and buttery it's hard to stomach everything.   Grits- super creamy, almost soupy and extremely oil but worth having a couple bites of. Watermelon iced tea- only ok Mimosa- I'm pretty close to being an alcoholic, so need I say more? Overall, worth the wait, but make sure to have a light dinner the evening before.

I am craving Brenda's crawfish beignets right at this moment, so I thought it would be the perfect time to write this review. I came here with some friends a couple months ago for brunch on a Saturday morning. Thank goodness one member of our group got there a little earlier than the rest of us, but we still ended up waiting about 2 hours. (The person who came earlier waited 2.5 hours.) We were a pretty large group - 11 people - so that might be why we waited that long. Most tables looked to be for groups of 2-4. You have to pay for street parking which sucks, but the food here is oh-so-worth-it! We all ordered a bunch of different things, but the stand outs were the shrimp and grits and the crawfish beignets. I shared an order of the crawfish beignets with 2 other people as a starter to whet my appetite, but those things are huge! I could probably order just that for breakfast/brunch next time and be completely satisfied and still have 1 leftover for later. This is definitely not the healthiest of meals, but it's tooooo delicious. Whatever, treat yo'self!

Arrived at 10:40 on a Saturday with a party of 2.  There were 21 parties ahead of us, and we waited about 1 hr and 10 minutes for a table.  We expected the wait, and the hostess was really friendly and on top of it.  We came fully prepared with books and a thermos of tea to wait it out :)   If you have a large group, I would definitely say either come early or don't bother.  The line started to get really dense around 11:30.  Oh, and they don't let you bring it outside coffee, so make sure if you get Philz beforehand you have time to finish it (saw a group being asked to finish up their drinks before they would be seated). Food: Started with a cup of gumbo, super tasty. Then we had the flight of beignets (our wish to have 2 apple and 2 crawfish was granted).  These things are massive...and quite delicious.  I wasn't quite as blown away by the crawfish as I was expecting from other reviews, but I would definitely order them again. My partner ordered the crispy pork belly over cheesy grits.  Good, but he says he's had better pork belly and wishes he would have ordered the shrimp and grits. I ordered the creole veggie omelet.  At first bite I was kinda bummed--basically partially cooked veggies underneath a mound of cheddar and egg.  I was expecting more flavor.  However, I ate most of my plate after adding some hot sauce and salt and pepper :) I thought the grits were amazing, buttery bites of heaven and, if you are partial to jams like me, they had a yummy fresh raspberry jam for toast. Overall, would go back.  Quite an adorable place and really great service.  I would like to explore their other dishes, lots of creative things on the menu!

Omgosh I love this place. I've been here once and went to a party with catered food from here. Every time I eat from here my SOUL IS SATISFIED :) Everything is just so tasty. I love the atmosphere too, there is a whole wall covered in mirrors. Their biscuits are great, cream biscuits!  I paired it with an onion soup I ordered (which is really delicious too and only 5 dollars!) and that was a good meal for not wanting to go too heavy that night. I tried the shrimp and grits as well... only comment is that it looks too cheesy and fattening... has a lil spice too it but I think its too much for one person and it must be eaten with biscuits. I totally recommend this place to soul food lovers!!!

came here for the 2nd time, and as usual, there was a long wait (about an hour or so).   But it was well worth the wait!  While we were waiting, we ordered the watermelon tea (can be refilled!) and spiced bloody Mary.   My previous review mentioned that they don't have po'boy on the weekend brunch menu.  But i went on a Sunday this time, and they actually have it now!  i ordered a half and half po'boy (half shrimp and half oyster), and the portion was really big!!!  After 1.5 of the crawfish beignet, I couldn't finish the po'boy! :(  I like the shrimp a lot, so i probably skip the oyster next time!

I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN.  Said no one ever.   I love coming to Brenda's.  I've only come here for breakfast/brunch/lunch unfortunately but the dinner menu looks AWESOME.  It's street parking (meter) here but I seem to always luck out and find a space right out front. hehe I just saw today and it's $3 for an hour! How crazy is that??! SF, what are you doing?! D:   Anywho, I ordered the beignet flight with my friend since it was his first time and I thought why not try them all? Chocolate is definitely my favorite but I was so full by the time I got to it (because our main dishes had come already) but it would've been more amazing if I wasn't.  I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Grits.  And though my other friends have ordered this before and I tried it, I still never had an opinion about grits or ever recall what is it.  But I will FOREVER remember now.  It's basically corn meal.  I love that there's an egg hidden in there and honestly, it tastes best when you mix it up to me because the flavor just blends together well.  My friend ordered the Chicken Etouffée and we both agreed that it tastes a bit like gumbo.  But I can't find the words (and it's not just because I'm have a small vocabulary, because that is true also D: ) to describe this place.   The service is always so friendly, if it's your first time, let them know because they'll make sure you pick something worth trying out for (though I think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu) and they tell you about what's in each dish.   I really need to come back here for dinner and write another review.  But until then, I hope everyone else can enjoy this place as much as I do!

Love the Beignets! The Crawfish is good, the apple is good, the Ghiradelli Chocolate Beignet?!?!?! OMFG OMFG I slapped my hand on the table to how amazing it is!!! Definitely am coming here again for more! The crispy pork belly grits dish I had was great too! I LOVE GRITS! My only confusion was the waitress...So we would have one blonde girl say have you decided your order where by we would reply...then literally a MINUTE later an Asian girl would come by asking if we have decided our order, but we were like no we are good we told the other lady. Same thing happened again: Blond girl came by to refill our coffee, which she did, and then a MINUTE later Asian girl came by to ask if we needed a refill? I was like ECHO ECHO ECHO?? Annoying! Stop it! Get your act together and have one waitress for a table! Apart of me felt like those two were doing it on purpose or something! It was driving me up the wall!

Well... Tried coming here a few times, but the length of a line would always scare me.  This Saturday morning I was optimistic enough to put my name on the board, go get Philz coffee, come back, and wait.....and wait.... I've never had to wait SO LONG for food before.  It was over an hour :( And the worst part was - the food wasn't worth it.  I had the shrimp & goat cheese omelette, boyfriend had eggs benedict. Let's start with mine:  I absolutely love goat cheese!  I can eat it every single day and I won't need anything else... except for meat.  (but you get the idea!).  Anyway, the food was lukewarm.  The omelette was just OK.   Side note: Most portions are too big for me to finish.  If the food is delicious, my seams would be bursting, but I'd finish it!  This wasn't the case, despite my life-long love towards goat cheese. My honey-bunny ordered eggs benedict.  They serve it on a biscuit (Biscuit was crazy-good, by the way!).  I usually go coo coo  for the hollandaise  sauce, but this one was just soooo unbelievably dull and flavorless... So, we left the place sad and half-hungry..  Boo :(

My real complaint about this place is the wait.  On the weekends, it can be ridiculously long (2+ hours) even at 3pm, which is off hours.  Came here during the weekend of new year's, and we waited a little less than an hour, but was just too hungry to wait longer, and we left. This time we went on a friday afternoon, so there was no wait!  Ordered the shredded pork sandwich special and the fried chicken.  Weirdly enough there was a lot of things (utensils and condiments) missing from our table so we had to continuously ask for some or steal some from our neighbors.  The fried chicken is delicious and the fries are fried to perfection, just the right crispness.  The coleslaw was okay, I didn't really eat much of that.  The shredded pork sandwich was BBQ goodness though and the signif ate that happily. Too bad we were too full for the king's special on the beignet.  I had the flight once before, but we waited til the end of our meal to eat it and it wasn't as good.  Def eat the beignets right when they come out, and eat it in the least flavorful to the most cause otherwise your taste buds will be all out of wack.  We had the savory one first and just couldn't taste much but the apple one after.  My tip is to eat the plain one, then apple, then the savory one, and then the chocolate to even everything out.   Also, the watermelon tea is very delicious.  Def worth getting as a drink. But def a lovely place to get brunch or dinner.  The food will always be delicious.  Just the wait will be ridiculous.  Get there beforehand, put your name down, get some philz down the street, walk around for an hour, and then come back for your meal.  Haha, but yes, a good place if you're down to wait.

Have you looked at the high rating distribution for Brenda's? Yes, that's a lot of hype, but hot-damn this place rocks! It's comfort food at its finest! Who cares about the grimy location because its a whole new world inside this jazzy, happening, feed-your-soul with fried chicken goodness and bring your friends kind-of spot.  The staff was on point with their friendly, make-yourself-at-home hospitality, even while hot-n-busy.  Leave your diets outside the front door and loosen up your belt  buckle for some down right ridiculously good grub. We waited about 30 minutes, looking over the menu before we were seated: Flight of Bignets (devoured)? Check! Fried Chicken and grits? Check! Hushpuppies? Check! Wash it down with sweet watermelon ice-tea? My pleasure! Sharing is optional but make sure you drape some napkins around your lap and have some extras handy.   The after meal Coup de Café (I tried one sip), was a bit to hard core for me, especially on a full belly. Yikes! Note: Plan for metered parking if driving during the day or else take public transit and expect a long wait since it's all the rave.

You'll have to brave the crackish TL community and arrive early to beat the rush. Is it worth it? My experience said....not really.   I walked in shortly after they opened on a Saturday so excited to try this place. I grabbed a table, ordered my breakfast and felt like a kid on Christmas day. The hype among my peers made this place seem like that of brunch soul legend. I was served a LUKEWARM pulled pork eggs benedict with a piping hot side of grits. How this happened, as I was the first person in the building served breakfast, I am not sure. The poached eggs were covered in a very bland hollandaise which was slightly disappointing, but the superb quality of the pulled pork and the mesmerizing biscuit had me impressed. As I finished my grits, I noticed the waitress checking on everyones meal but mine. I found that strange, and would've been honest, but all I got was a bill after I finished brunch. Gonna try what else is raved about (Mama's) in SF before returning. The Chinese Democracy of The CIty for sure.

Has it been said enough yet? Crawfish beignets. Crawfish beignets. Crawfish beignets. Yes, they really are that good. Get them. But eat them without any expectations, so that it'll be 100x better when you taste that delicious, cheesy, savory, spicy filling inside that perfectly fried, doughy shell. I could order a plate of these, finish only one of them, still get incredibly full, and save the remaining two for lunch and dinner. The other dishes are pretty good here. Grits are spectacular. Gumbo is a little too plain and gooey with okra juice for me. Hangtown fry -- well, come on, oysters, bacon, and eggs can't be beat. Eggs benedict are aces, although the biscuit could be less dense. Fried chicken is awesome, always. Don't be alarmed by the weekend crowd outside the doors. Just put your name on the chalkboard and wait. If the host gives you a wait time that's much shorter than expected, don't be skeptical -- the line moves at a good rate here. Enjoy, y'all.

Looking for great breakfast in the Tenderloin...look no further. Staying across the street from Brendas for the weekend was an awesome coincidence. Put our name on the chalk board for about a half hour wait on a saturday morning. Service is excellent. We had about 6 different people making sure we were taken care of. My fiance had the pork belly and cheese grits...or as she called it..."hella good". Pork was delicious. I had the sausage omelet which was very good as well. Fluffy biscuits are the best I've had. An sample order of beignets to go and we are good to go. Comfort food done.

Just thinking and writing about Brenda's makes me craveeee for soul food.   Soul food is the perfect comfort food that will hit your spot on a day where you need to turn that frown upside down.   Ordered: -Crawfish beignets: DELICIOUS!!! They are actually pretty big.  One beignet could of filled me up with a whole side dish itself.  We thought they were smaller so ended up ordering 2 of them.  No wonder they cost $2.75 each -Shrimp & Grits: grits went well with the biscuit we got :P -BFC: the fried chicken wasn't the BEST that I have had but was good enough.  This came with a biscuit -Mac 'n Cheese: Totally awesome and not too cheesy.  After this side dish came out, we realized that we ordered too much... It's a pretty nefty side dish so I must warn you! Put your name down on the chalkboard and hope the wait is short!  We got there around opening time so we were 5th in line.  Tables are very close to each other so don't come here if you get uncomfortable with possibly bumping elbows with your neighbor. AMAZE BALLS for soul food. That is all. Maybe I should make a trip to Brenda's soon now... Dangit!

Whoever you are Brenda, please come home to Texas with me. It's closer to New Orleans anyway! Everything on the menu sounded orgasmic. I will try my best not to repeat what's already been said on the other 1500+ reviews, so I'll keep it short and sweet. Beignets: you can order individually too if you don't want 3 of each nor the 4 sampler. You MUST try the Crawfish Beignet though. Crunchy exterior, but overflowing with what taste's like grandma's crawfish etouffee - bursting with creole flavor and spices. The sweet beignets are also good, but not as unique, and I like Cafe Du Monde's original beignets the best still. I tried the Hangtown Fry - eggs scrambled with fried oyster and other goodies. It was like a po-boy in an omelette! You can choose between grits or hash as a side, and toast or biscuit. I'd recommend the grits and biscuit. Great service, hefty portions. The earlier you come on a weekend morning, the less time you will have to wait. Felt like New Orleans! Except a lot more hipster crowd.

Nowhere is the need to compartmentalize one's desire for blissfully indulgent eating and one's desire for good health and longevity more acute.  The ubiquity of decadent delights - in marvelous combinations of butter, sugar, egg, cheese or chocolate - makes Brenda's a lick-your-lips-then-your-plate paradise.   My focus on this visit was on the sweet and the sweeter.  There were the chocolate beignets, hot and gooey in the middle, then slightly chewy  and then faintly crisp on the outside, all of that coated with a thick layer of powdered sugar.  Then came a daily special, listed first on the chalkboard, where my eyes went no further:  sweet potato pancakes, brown sugar syrup, toasted pecans.  Wow.  These cakes tasted like the inside of the world's tastiest sweet potato pie, and the brown sugar was caramelized and the ideal complement.   I didn't entirely ignore the savories - the cream biscuits are soft and sinful, served warm from the oven, and great on their own or in alternating bites with any of several delicious egg dishes, or the fresh savory sausage links, or even the salty-sweet molasses ham.  And then there were the cheese grits, an anomalous presence on the West Coast that would have been right at home in a down-home diner in the heart of Dixie.   The main dining room is dominated by an amazing mural featuring a leaping crayfish set against a clean, cinder block wall.  A picturesque backdrop, and an incredible place.

Listen up school kids! This is one place where writing your name on the board is a good thing! Approach the white chalkboard and be prepared to wait in line for all the goodness Brenda has to offer! This is one of the best brunch's I've ever had in SF, and that says a lot considering their are many brunch places to be reckoned with. It's best to come here with a group of friends so you can dabble into several items on the menu without feeling too guilty for having gone overboard. IMO This is the closest you can get to tasting New Orleans, brunch style. You absolutely CANNOT pass up any of their beignets from the traditional sugar coated basic to the crawfish stuffed ones--if you can't decide try their "beignet flight" that works perfect when splitting amongst friends. We also split this AMAZING eggs benedict complete with shredded beef which they served as a special and the serving complimented with the sweets perfectly! For those that wish to remain on the sweet side, I highly recommend checking out their French Toast which just melts in your mouth. Brenda, you've done it right!

I just want to say that food here was amazing and the coffee is like lightning in cup. We came here because our friend said it was a must and it sure is. Be careful with the portions here because they are huge. You could probably split a dish and be just fine, especially if you have an order of beignets (3 per order). I didn't get the flight of beignets but it looked like a meal in itself.  Get there early or be prepared to wait in line. This line by is by no means as crazy as Mama's. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely come back and try another delicious dish. Biggest Complaint and why the 4 and not a 5? This place definitely deserves a 5 for the food but the service was pretty mediocre. Our waiter wasn't paying attention to any tables in his section and other waiters/servers were busy delivering food. Basically it felt like he was borderline ignoring us/zoom by quickly so I couldn't ask. It took forever to get a second cup of coffee and even though I asked for water twice, I never got it.  Small things sure but it's the small things that make the difference. Don't worry Brenda I'll be back  your food did most of the talking.

Their beignets were delicious. I couldn't decide so I ordered the Beignet Flight which included one of each. I shared them with my friend too, they were huge. I really like the crawfish one & the apple one. Their interior decor with all the different mirrors was amazing. (I like mirrors). I ordered the Hangtown Fry. It was huge. I barely finished it, but it was soooo good! It was a fried oyster, bacon & scallion scramble. It came with hashbrowns and a piece of toast. The service was great. I will definitely come back!

Brendas was BOMB!!!! First off, this is the first place in my entire life that I waited 2 hours to eat! I had a group of 6 people and boy did I have to convince then to hang in there and that it would be all worth it. Somehow, my party was convinced when, throughout the 2 hour wait, over a hundred if not more, people walked in and out of this place! This place is fantastic! Things i need to rave about: -southern chicken eggs Benedict -watermelon sweet tea (DO IT!!!!) -beignet sampler was great but I was not diggin the crawfish option. I think they should stick to sweet ones only - grits were so delicious and melted in your mouth -CUSTOMER SERVICE: FAST AND FRIENDLY I will definitely be back!!! Loved this place!

Can anyone say hype? Haha. This place is all that. The long lines, the small tables, the homeless ppl outside constantly asking you to buy them lunch. Yep, it's all there. I got the fried shrimp po'boy and crawfish beignets to go. The sandwich itself was mushy. It could have been a lot better with a difference in textures. The shrimp was not crunchy at all on the outside. The sauce was okay though. They put a lot of it on the sandwich. It's served with a side of either French fries or coleslaw. The beignets were oily. I wasn't able to eat them fresh, but the insides were just okay in taste. The dough itself was actually really good though. I tasted the crawfish, apple, and chocolate ones. Crawfish had a bit too much paprika sprinkled on it which made eating it less enjoyable because of the sandy texture; the apple one tasted of too much nutmeg; and the chocolate one could have done with less filling because it over-powered the outside. But hey, it's not that bad. If I were to find myself coming back here I would definitely try the shrimp and grits. Still looks delicious.

Hm, 3.5 stars.  I arrived early to put our party of 3 on the board and luckily I did because a hoard of people came pouring in after me.  Our wait was roughly 30 mins which  guess isn't that bad.   We shared the chocolate beignets which were delicious but a little too chocolatey if there's ever such a thing.  An order came with 3 and that was just enough for our table.  It was too much and by the time I was down to my last bite I had to push it away and not finish.  I got the fried chicken benedict and although I loved the hollandaise sauce the chicken was fairly boring and I kinda wished I opted for another dish.  My friend got the shrimp and grits dish and he said it was wonderful but the grits had way too much cheese.  I saw him pick up a fork full and had to wrap the cheese over and over his fork like pasta.  Some might think that's the most delicious thing they've ever seen but it was a little much for him and for me to watch him eat.   Overall I'm glad I finally made it out there.  It was my other two friends' first time also.  I don't like waiting in line for food so it may be a while before I come back.  Maybe on another day where I have the day off but not when everyone else in the city does.

I think I had too high of expectations for this place but I definitely think people are hyping it up way too much. The food here is good however, I don't think it's worth the two hour wait. I had the crawfish beignets which is one of the most raved about items, however I was so disappointed. Felt like too much dough/bread and not enough filling! If you haven't ate here, you shouldn't get too excited like me and maybe it'll taste as amazing as all the other reviews. Good thing the entrees were good though. I had the hangtown fry (oyster and bacon scramble) which was pretty good, and the cat-fish po-boy was simple but amazing! Loved the po-boy! I would come back if the wait wasn't so long...

I really liked my hangtown fry. Fried oyster and eggs: damn. 11 dollars is a little more than I'd want to pay for such a small dish though. The biscuit that came with was pretty damn good too but the grits were a little too buttery. Both tasted really awesome anyway. Best dish at our table was probably the shrimp and grits. Cheesy grits and shrimp with a tomato sauce. Surprisingly delicious. Our table shared a flight of beignets. Best was the plain in our opinion. It was fluffy but not overly sweet. The crawfish one was pretty delicious but kinda strange for a beignet. I think the other two (chocolate and apple) were pretty good as desserts. We paid 9 dollars for the flight but I would probably just get the plain beignets. Watermelon iced tea was awesome too. Just the right balance between watermelon juice and ice tea and free refills. 3 dollars! Service was alright. They were nice about refilling the tea and coming to check on us. Plus, at 6pm on a Sunday, the place was surprisingly empty which left plenty of space for the 5 in our party.

Biscuits? Hell yeah. Everything was amazing! Went here by the suggestion of a friend and will definitely be going back. Every time I'm in the city I think of Brenda's as a potential place to eat.

Lauren P. and I stopped by for weekday business brunch recently (get there before 12 and you shouldn't have to wait long). High expectations due to all the hype, but food was pretty much just average. Service was quick and responsive. They've expanded so it's much bigger and nicer. Crawfish beignet - came out nice and hot but had way too much paprika Shrimp and grits - rich and hearty taste but extremely cheesy and greasy Jambalaya - not spicy enough, rice didn't have enough bite Biscuit and jam - delicious! I've been to New Orleans before and sadly haven't found a place that does French soul food in the Bay Area that comes close. Holla at me if you have any suggestions!

CRAWFISH BEIGNETS! they're a must. my friend told me about this place and i decided to try it today.  she recommended the crawfish beignets and the sweet potato pancakes.  i'm not a fan of sweets during breakfast so i opted for the grillades and grits instead.  it was good but super filling, i only ate a third of it.  the grits were creamy but i got tired of them after a bit.  my friend got the jambalaya and boy, that was good.  maybe i'll get that next time... or try one of their delicious looking po boys.  definitely get the crawfish beignets!! they're filled with crawfish and cheesy goodness.

Extremely greasy and overly salty grits.  The beignets are more impressive for how extraordinarily large they are than for their taste.  Service is friendly.   In my opinion, if you want a brunch that puts you in a particular scene with a specific crowd of people, then Brenda's is your place.  For a good, satisfying brunch, Brenda's is not.

Yes, all the 3,000 plus reviews confirm my experience. It is very yummy. The crawfish beignets are to die for.. cheesy and warm with a dusting of sweet paprika.. (I see a lot of reviews saying cayenne pepper. It would be very very hot if it was) The grits were also cheesy and buttery. So good. The hangtown fry was perfect. They have the nicest flaky biscuits and their jam is to die for.

I. Food: 4 II. Service: 3.5 III. Environment: 3.5 I. LOVED the food. I never really had French Soul Food, but it was really great for a first.  The combinations of flavors just tasted so perfect and delicious. We ordered the Crawfish Beignet and Shrimp & Grits. Crawfish Beignet is amazing. It came with 3 large pieces. It was stuffed with crawfish, scallions, and chedder... topped with cayenne. The bread was soft and browned to perfection. It can be a little messy especially because it had a lot of cayenne on top. This was very filling. Shrimp & Grits is to die for. If you are a big fan of cheese, bacon, and shrimp, this is your dream come true. The ingredients they added in this dish was perfect. The cheesy grits was delicious and the bits of bacon and shrimp made it better. We ordered one biscuit on the side to eat with the Shrimp & Grits. II. Service: It was a little better than average. Our first waiter that took our order was a little disconnected and not too friendly. But our waitress that served us our food was very attentive and provided excellent customer service. III. Environment: the decor felt very vintage. The walls made the restaurant look like it may have been some kind of warehouse before. It had a nice mural on it... which gave the restaurant character. The restaurant felt a little bit cramped because of the overall design/layout. It's SF though-- you can't really expect a lot of space. Not too sure about parking, we walked from Market street.

NOTE: If you're looking for a hipster review, this isn't one. If you're looking for a review by a wanna be food critic, this isn't one. If you're looking for a review seeping with over the top wit (because secretly I lack any in real life), this isn't it. Simply put, I've had more than my share of restaurant breakfast and brunches and Brenda's is one of the best. I've eaten there at least 15 times, and whether it's the grits, biscuits, flight of beignets, peach cobbler pancakes, crawfish po boy, or water melon iced tea, Brenda's has never failed me. For those that say its not worth the hype or it wasn't as good as they'd expected, they've clearly lost sight that at the end of the day Brenda's is just breakfast/brunch grub (and dinner sometimes too). Breakfast is suppose to be simple and delicious and make you feel good for the rest of the day. And that's exactly what the food at Brenda's is.

Straight ahead & delicious Louisiana style southern food on the sketchiest corner in SF outside of Bayview/Hunter's Point. The neighborhood is sketch - in the 10 minute walk from BART I saw a dude 1/2 peeing on a tree, 1/2 peeing on himself & a woman slobbering & crying asking for money. Lucky for us, we arrived on a Sunday night at 7pm (when they serve their brunch menu), so we got a table immediately & didn't have to hang outside with the crackheads. The fried chicken: Solid portion (leg, wing, breast) for the price ($18) + excellent southern (re: pork) greens, an incredibly fluffy & delicious biscuit + a hot pepper jelly (pretty sure it was Crystal's hot sauce with honey). Added an extra side of cole slaw b/c I like something cold & crispy with my fried bird. The meat & breading was delicious - moist, dripping & the breading was a little spicy. Only downside was that it was a bit too greasy vs crispy - the skin was a little slimy vs crunch. The boyfriend got red beans & rice with sausage + iced watermelon iced tea: Well-spiced, nourishing, he loved it. The watermelon iced tea has watermelon puree - it's not super sweet & it's a strong brewed iced tea - add some lemon & extra ice. We also ordered a single beignet since we were pretty stuffed - it's not on the menu, but they'll let you order just one. We ordered the plain w/ powered sugar & added a little bit of the strawberry preserves they have on each table. Solid service - water glasses stayed refilled, plates cleared quickly, check brought over on time.

Powerful combination!  Had shrimp grits and a beignet. There a 10 other items on the menu I can't wait to try soon. The wait is worth it. They seemed to move the line along very quickly. Only bad part is you need t stand on the street while you wait.

I love this place! Been here a few times for brunch. The wait is crazy but it's sooooo worth it. When you go in, make sure to write your name and party size on the chalkboard (which is such a cute idea) but make sure to write legibly. They have increased the size of this place but it's still too small because they are always busy. Start with a mimosa and the beignet flight. The chocolate beignets are good of course, cause they have chocolate in them. The crawfish beignets are my fave tho, some people might be hesitant to eat them because of the crawfish but they are delicious! The crawfish tastes like crab kind of and the seasoning is cajun. I always get the shrimp & grits, they are cheesy amazing goodness. The "gravy" they put on top does have bacon in it but if you're a vegetarian just ask and they can replace it with a bacon-free option.

I'm not normally in the TL, if ever, but due to its proximity to the auto tint place for my car I decided to go for it. We had a late lunch so we didn't have to wait. We had dungeness crab beignet, crispy pork belly grits, etouffee, and 1 piece of fried chicken was really, really good. LOVED the grits, etouffee had a slight kick to it which was good, and the fried chicken was flavorful and juicy. The dungeness crab beignet was delicious but the temperature was lukewarm. I really enjoyed every bite and thank goodness I worked out the morning before I ate here. Server was friendly so no complaints there, if I'm in the area I'll stop by again for their dee-lish cheesy grits.

The place gets packed and quick. Not sure why. The food is said to be southern but more of a fusion than true southern. The portions were small and the light was dark. The food itself was pretty decent, just nothing I would say wow about or certainly be waiting more than 30 minutes for. The tables are smalls so for parties of more than 6 people, makes squeezing together the only way to sit, not including bumping into people in the walkway.

Being on a very tight schedule, my dad, my brother, and I were deterred by the 30 minute wait. The guy who took our order was very friendly and nice, even though it was obvious he was stressed to serve the full house of customers (plus the waiting line). We ordered one veggie omelette with sides of toast and potato hash, and one [...] with sides of grits and toast both to go. They were wicked fast with our orders and we were out the door in no time. When we opened our boxes, BOTH SIDES of toast were missing, and the portions were not at all worth $22 together. The veggie omelette had a very unpleasant chemical-like taste to it, and the grits were just ok. The [...] omelette was very good, and the side of potato hash was fine. Although it is hard to judge a restaurant by ordering out, this restaurant would not be one I'd choose off the top of my head for a good meal.

My boyfriend's sister took us to a brunch place close by to Parc 55 Hotel in San Francisco on Superbowl Sunday. This place is quite small, and there is really no parking in front of it, but you can't miss it since there's usually a bunch of people standing outside of the restaurant. Even though we came at around 11 to 12ish, we still had to wait for about ten minutes. They have a cool chalkboard where you write your name on it. Unfortunately, they only seat you when your entire party is present, and with the parking situation, that's a little difficult. It's a very nice place that really reflects on the French soul food that Brenda's serves. Lots of nice decorations, and though it's small, it's very high in the ceiling (from what I remember), which gives it a lot of air space, if that makes sense. It wasn't too crowded or anything. Our table ordered Catfish Po' Boy, Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Crispy Pork Belly, French Toast with the additional butter pecan sauce, and Shrimp and Grits I believe. On top of that, we ordered a Beignet Flight for the entire table to share. My boyfriend ordered the sweet watermelon house tea, and I believe his sisters ordered lattes. The waitresses seemed to be very busy as the tables were all full. They weren't mean, but they weren't overly friendly either; however, I did understand that they were very busy, and the food did make up for it. The watermelon tea was very good. There's bits of watermelon in there, and it tastes really refreshing. With the added refills, I do believe this tea is worth the $2.75. The Beignet Flight was pretty darn amazing. Four different beignets (one of basically each one they have): one is a plain one, one filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate, another with Granny smith apples that have been sweetened with cinnamon honey butter, and the last is the savory one with crawfish that has been spiced with cayenne, scallions and cheddar. I have to say that out of the three (I didn't try the plain one), I liked the granny smith one the best. Full of flavor and I could taste the cinnamon honey butter. I loved the powdered sugar on top. Basically tastes like a very sweet doughnut. I didn't care too much for the savory one. It was good, but I think I prefer the beignets to be sweet. And then the food! I was already a little full from the beignets, but I had to make room for the Catfish Po' Boy. I think this dish knocked it out of the park for me. I really liked it. I am typically a fan of sandwiches, so I really liked the concept of this dish. Soul food with a little twist. The dish was filled with fries and the sandwich was pretty big. I ended up eating only half. The fish was good, and so was the sauce and the baguette it was served on. I had to smear the sauce onto the bread so there would be more taste for the entire sandwich. They also give you pickled watermelon on the side. Not sure what that was for, but ate it as a refresher. I liked the sandwich a lot. Worth the money and tasted great. I tried my boyfriend's pulled pork eggs benedict. His dish was filled with food, too. It comes with grits or hash, and he got the potatoes, which weren't that great. But he raved about the biscuits that the pulled pork eggs benedict were served on. As for the other dishes, everybody else really liked them. By the end of the meal, the restaurant was less packed, and the waitresses were more relaxed, and helped fill the drinks a few times. I wasn't a big fan of soul food, but this place really made me enjoy it! I didn't get to finish the Catfish Po' Boy, as I gave the leftovers to a homeless woman sitting outside, (very glad I just cut the sandwich with a knife thus not spreading any germs!) and I would like to hope that she enjoyed the food very much. Have to give it 5 stars as I don't usually eat this type of food, and they made it an A+ experience in my book. tl;dr: give this place a try! You won't be sorry. :) The food is pretty amazing.

Meh. Not worth the hype. If you still insist on going, please steer clear of the shrimp and grits. Too heavy and too cheesy. If you don't want to spend the rest of your afternoon digesting your brunch, i suggest you go to 1300 Fillmore (oops, was I not supposed to say that?!).

I honestly can't say enough good things about this restaurant. My favorite item on the menu is the beignet flight which could easily be a meal itself. If you feel intimidated by the flight, I would say order the crawfish beignets; you will not be disappointed. But you know what, the flight is such a good idea because you can eat the plain beignet to start and then move onto the crawfish one followed by the apple beignet and finish the meal off with a beignet stuffed with Ghiardelli chocolate. It really is perfect. I've also had some of the eggs benedicts as well and they are just as phenomenal as the beignets. One thing I really love about Brenda's is if you're lucky enough to wait inside for a table you are serviced free coffee and tea! The service inside Brenda's is extremely quick and your cup is never without coffee. A few things to watch out for with Brenda's: 1. Get there early or else you could be waiting for at least an hour, or an hour and a half. 2. Find a source of public transportation as meter parking on the street can get expensive quick. 3. Prepare your stomach for an intensely good meal.

One tip that I have for fellow yelpers is that mk sure when u gt there u hv yur entire party with you.. this place gets really crowded even at 9:30am on Saturday...The food however is worth the wait ... we had the Beignet Flight, Creole Veggie Omelette, catfish poboy,Shrimp & Grits  and the pulled pork egg benedict... everything was really good and the service level was great.. given that they had so many ppl waiting outside, we didnt feel rushed.. the food was fresh... I felt the bloody mary was a bit watered down and my wife didn't quite like the mimosa....overall one my new fav brunch place in the city....

I went to Brenda's with a friend and I had been trying to get there for some time now.  The food was great and as usual my eyes were BIGGER than my stomach.  The plus to that is a got to taste quite a few things and everything was fantastic!  The only drawback is the place is just very small...I was lucky that we got there early on a Friday night...got a park right in front of the door and didn't have to wait!  The restaurant gods must have been looking down in me that day. So it was just overall just a really nice experience.

Last week, the fella and I embarked on a semi-spontaneous road trip to San Francisco (when I say spontaneous, I meant that we didn't make hotel reservations until one to two days prior departure.)  Since the trip was fairly last minute, we didn't make any plans other than to walk around and get our eat on.  Inspired by Anthony Bourdain's show, The Layover, we trekked through the City (with the help of handy little Yelp in our hands) for some delicious eats. While we surprisingly sampled quite an abundant amount of locations through small bites, the one joint that our taste buds really loved was Brenda's French Soul Food on Polk Street. Upon popular references and recommendation, we started off our meal with two greedy orders of the Crawfish Beignets.  The beignets are like the layers of the Earth - thin and crispy on the outside yet warm and doughy on the inside (and that was just the beignet itself.)  Once you hit core, an explosion of Southern spices and flavor tingles the taste buds and everything just falls into place and compliments each other.  The layer of cayenne pepper and sprinkle of chopped scallions resting on top of the beignet plays an intricate part in bringing out the fresh and crunchy crawfish coated in savory cream from inside.  Although tasty, I would recommend sharing a beignet as it was quite a heavy starter. Not sure what to order for our entrees, we let the recommendation of our server decide.  I ordered the BLC whereas the fella went with the Catfish Po'Boy.  Perhaps it was the overdo in greasiness of the main items (i.e. fried chicken & catfish), but I enjoyed the sides more than anything.  The hot pepper jelly was SO delectable that we asked for another serving of it to dip all of our fried goodness in.  This sweet and spicy condiment reminds me of a cross between sirracha and honey - lots of honey.  If they had a bottle of this at our table, it would have mysterious disappeared with us at the end of the meal. Another worthy mention was the side of coleslaw.  Imagine the sweet and tangy taste of what KFC's coleslaw tastes like.  Got it?  Well, this slaw was a impeccable dup of it - only without all the drippy, saucy aspect.  We really liked how Brenda's captured this favorite side dish through seasoning and spices without overcompensating in sauce.  This allowed the coleslaw to retain its fresh, crispiness without the collateral in flavor. Looking forward to coming back to Brenda's for brunch!

I looooove the Sloppy Josephine!  I don't even like regular Sloppy Joe's, but there's something in this sandwich that makes it different and more exciting than the norm.  I've also had the grits, which are super buttery (that's a compliment!) and the biscuits just melt in your mouth!

Came here for lunch with a homeboy of mine. Stepping inside, we were confronted with a wait, but considering the hype we've heard about the place, we decided on staying despite our massive hunger, which is important to keep in mind. After observing the other patrons and seeing the satisfied looks on all their faces we couldn't help but be super excited to order as evidenced by our decision to go with the po-boy, BFC, fried shrimp and some regular beignets. -Po-boy: This sandwich was pretty good, I have to admit. Very crispy and light. The ratio of catfish to sandwich and other ingredients was balanced as it should have been. -BFC: As excited and hungry as I was for this dish, I was disappointed. Perhaps this was an isolated event, but my chicken fried pretty crispy...in fact it was overdone. The skin was quite a few shades darker than you would find on most perfectly done fried chicken, and burnt taste also re-affirmed my hunch. Otherwise, the chicken was still nice and juicy on the inside...but without the accompanying skin, it felt incomplete. -Beignets: These were alright....I remember being so excited for something sweet that i hurriedly bit into them and burnt my mouth, which at the time annoyed me a little bit on top of the overdone fried chicken I received. -Fried shrimp: Nothing special really, it sorta reminded me of the kind you get at popeyes in terms of taste, which doesn't justify the extra "French Soul Food" tax you pay for them. Regrettably, we didn't go for the crawfish beignets because we weren't aware of their status among diners. Nonetheless, the homie and I both agreed the food was ok, the service was friendly and very attentive, but we probably won't be going out of our way to wait for what we considered food that is just OK.

I love Brenda's. A short return trip to the Bay resulted in a request that I eat at Brenda's. The last time I was at Brenda's the place was about 1/3 of the size and didn't serve dinner. My how things have changed. Tasty tasty: - Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea ($2.75) - Crawfish Beignet ($2.75) - Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo ($4.00/cup) - Shrimp and Grits ($13.00) - BBQ Pork Ribs ($15.75) On a Wednesday night around 6:30-7:00pm there was no wait. I was excited to hear that they do dinner now and that their space has doubled in size. We were quickly sat upon entering. Our waitress was very nice and promptly took our drink order and then our food order. I didn't see very many servers on the floor, and the restaurant was quite packed. I read a few reviews about not great service, but as a former server I thought our waitress did a great job for basically taking care of the entire floor alone. One of the things Brenda's is known for is their sweet watermelon iced tea, which I had somehow never had before. The tea has fresh watermelon in it and is absolutely delicious. The flavor is pretty subtle, very refreshing and is not very sweet for being "sweet tea"; however, I liked that since sweet tea is often way too sweet for my taste. Also, it's refillable! Onto the food... I've had all the beignets at Brenda's, but by far the best is the crawfish beignet, which I believe is also their most popular. If you want to try the others, you can get the flight, which comes with all the flavors just a bit smaller--the granny smith apple beignet is pretty good, too. The beignet itself comes freshly fried, light and fluffy with a dust of cayenne pepper on top. The crawfish filling is delicious, flavorful, cheesy and not at all skimpy on the crawfish. A definite must order. The cup of gumbo was delicious, too. Rich, flavorful and way more filling that we expected.  The chunks of chicken were really tender. I ordered the shrimp and grits. Holy crap, talk about filling and rich. I was only able to eat about half of my dish, mostly because half a beignet and half a cup of gumbo had already kind of filled me up, but also because the grits were rich, not that I thought it was going to be light...There was a lot of melted cheddar and the grits itself tasted pretty buttery, like Paula Dean buttery. The shrimp were cooked just right and I loved the addition of the "spicy" tomato-bacon gravy ("spicy" because I didn't find it all that spicy). In fact, I wish there had been more of the gravy. Overall, super delicious. Mike opted for the BBQ pork ribs which were good, but not super awesome. We both found that the ribs were not as tender-fall-off-the-bone as we'd have preferred, but still good. The collard greens that accompanied the ribs were tasty, as was the macaroni and cheese, which was quite rich and creamy. Overall, Brenda's never let's me down. Do I feel like I've clogged arteries and gained 10 pounds after eating a Brenda's? Absolutely. But do I feel like it's worth it? Absolutely.

The boyfriend and I had to see what this whole Brenda hype was about.. You start by trekking up a crowded walkway, pushing your way to the chalkboard to put down your name for the long wait ahead. The wait was hella long,which made us explore other nearby places (Saigon Sandwich and Philz Coffee-see review). Beignets were tasty but the overbearing size was a turn off for me. It was also pretty lame that they did not let us bring outside beverages inside the restaurant. In my opinion, the best item on their menu was the bottomless watermelon drink! Refreshing with chunks of watermelon. I would go again if I didn't have to wait.

To sum up my meal here: Wow. I've never even though of having Cajun for breakfast... but Brenda's has completely opened my stomach and mind to the possibility now. It's so freaking good it will blow your mind better than Missy Elliott ever could. My friend Bianca L. and I went all out starting off with a FLIGHT of beignets. I mean, a flight. A FLIGHT PEOPLE. I'd rather have a flight of beignets over a flight of shots any day. If it's your first time coming to Brenda's, just do yourself a favor and get the flight. It comes with plain, chocolate, apple and Cajun shrimp. The Cajun shrimp was my favorite. For my main dish, I ordered a special off the blackboard: Crispy pork belly with cheddar grits, poached egg and spicy onion relish. Holy Mother of Dog. Nothing quiet prepared me for the ecstasy I experienced at first swallow. The pork while crispy was so juicy and flavorful. The poached egg was perfectly runny and easily melted into its surrounding pillow of creamy grits. Southern jingles should be written about those grits, seriously. The spicy onion relish definitely added a nice little punch to the flavor of everything. It was the right amount of spicy in that it made your nose and eyes run just a little but you could still feel your tongue. Just wow, again. Now I know if I ever come back to SF, Brenda's is a must have for brunch.

OK, this place is delicious!!!! The wait is borderline rediculous, so def grab a small bite to eat so you're not famished by the time you're seated. Me and roomies were def on our fatty tip this day, so we ordered five things amongst the three of us: - regular beignets - veggie omelet - andouille sausage + cheese omelet - fried chicken eggs benedict - sweet potato pancakes first off... they're portions are effing humongous!!!! What is it with american restaurants these days?!?! My dish (the sausage and cheese omelet) along with the two sides that it came with -- potatoe hash and a creamed biscuit -- could comfortably feed 2-3 people. I was indeed on my fatty tip, but dangggggg. I ended up taking half of my dish home. While the omelets and benedicts were good, the sweet potato pancakes truly won my heart. I absolutely love pumpkin, and these tasted just like pumpkin pie in a fluffy cake form. I was in heaven with every bite. and the texture was just right. nice and fluffy. kind of like bread pudding. In my opinion, the sweet potato pancakes were most memorable. so you can imagine how devastated i was when i found out that these were a special... implying they're not on the menu all the time. sad face. SO all in all... I'm glad I went. the wait was a tad obnoxious, but I think the food was definitely good. I would go back but only next holiday/winter season when they're serving those sweet potato pancakes!!!

You've heard it before, but the beignets are the "must have".  I've only been twice for Sunday Brunch and waited for 20-30 min both times to be seated in the small dining area.  Arrive early.

I love foods that are suppose to be sweet or savory, but end up the other way around. So I was in a state of utter bliss after trying the Crawfish Beignet at Brenda's Frenh Soul Food. My friend described the beignet dough as "pillows of joy" and I couldn't have said it better myself. The dough is soft and light, having just enough texture to hold in the gooey goodness of crawfish mixture inside. Speaking of the inside, the chive, cheese and crawfish filling is divine. It just warms you up on a cold day in SF. I also got to try the Oyster Po'Boy, Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits and Gumbo. The Oyster Po'Boy was great. The oysters tasted like they were just picked out of the ocean that morning. I think the Po'Boy would've been better without the chipotle sauce. The Gumbo was good, though kind of one note. And the Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits were decent, but not something I would get again. Overall, the Crawfish Beignet alone is enough to keep me coming back

This has to be my favorite brunch spot so far. Honestly, well worth the wait! On a Saturday morning, the wait was roughly around an hour for 4 people, so it's not too bad. Everything we ordered was seriously so good, I really don't think words can describe. The benedicts are AH-MAZING since the biscuits are extremely crusty, topped with poached eggs, and gooey cheese...perfection. Their biscuits with jam is extremely heart-warming. They must put some drug called happiness in their food, especially the beignets. OMG. HEAVEN GALORE. The beignet flights are seriously the sh*t. It comes with four large beignets (crawfish, apple, plain, and chocolate) for only $9.50. I don't know about you, but I thought that was a steal! They were seriously all so perfect that I can't even pick a favorite. The crawfish was divine with it's savory and saltiness, while the chocolate and apple were filled with sweet and gooey glee. The plain on the other hand, was so simple, giving you the real taste of beignets without the toppings, but still oh so delicious! Perfect way to start your day in SF. Will not disappoint!

My bf and I excitedly walked over to Brenda's on New Years Day, determined to try a ridiculously well-rated restaurant before he left SF. Our hearts sank when we saw the hungry mob outside of Brenda's, but it was a nice day out so we ordered take out. We had to try the Beignet du Jour, which was a crab filled beignet. This was a meal in itself! The sauce is a must - be sure to drizzle it into the beignet! However, the crab filling had too much mayo for my taste and made the beignet an extremely rich and filling brunch item. I got the Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict, which was delish. Perfectly poached eggs, a sturdy yet soft biscuit which held up nicely as leftovers, and green onion fried potatoes = stick to your ribs kinda meal. The bf's Crispy Pork Belly & Grits were too heavy for me, but he loved it. He also couldn't finish it without feeling like a glutton. Brenda's is certainly a place for indulging yourself after having eaten healthily all week ;)

The food was good, but the wait was I N S A N E!!!! I am still not sure if the food was worth a 90 minute wait. The Bloody Mary was good and spicy, although I am not a huge fan of the seasoned glass rim. The beignet flight was good. My favorites were the plain and apple. Grillades and grits were good. Overall good and I would go back - IF I didn't have to wait so long. Oh, be sure to put your name on the chalkboard to "sign-in".

If you wanna try Brendas without the infamous wait go on a weekday for an early lunch. I came with two friends at 11:30 on a Friday and we waited only 10 minutes. The restaurant felt cozy and comfortable. Now to the food. We started with their bananas foster french toast and the crawfish beignets. The banana french toast was interesting but I think I prefer the original. The beignets came out soft and warm and is a must-try. The cayenne powder that coated the outside was a perfect compliment to the cheesy crawfish mess inside. Next, I tried half of a cornmeal shrimp po boy and half of a pulled pork po boy. Both were good choices but the shrimp had the slight edge in deliciousness. Sadly there was no room for dessert. I would definitely come back here.

Wow, the portions here are out of control. Our group started with the Crawfish Beignets and I was honestly full after half of one. The outside was dusted with creole spices (think lots of paprika and cayenne) and the inside was cheesy crawfish goodness. We ordered the pork belly grits and the pulled pork eggs benedict. The grits are good enough on their own, buttery and cheesiness. The poached egg was perfect, it almost looked fake it was so good. The best was the pulled pork benedict. The eggs rested on fluffy pillowy biscuits and had fall apart savory pulled pork and spicy creole hollandaise. I also ordered a virgin bloody mary so that I could really taste the flavor. It was a great spicy twist with creole spices around the rim and a pickled okra.

Had a wonderful brunch with 6 friends here.  Lots of shared dishes and lots of down home flavorful food in a nice atmosphere (high ceilings, modern southern decor).  There's a lot of calories in everything, but once in a while I don't mind. We had gingerbread pancakes (yummy!), pork belly and cheddar cheese with grits, and the beef grillades and grits (LOVE the cajun gravy and debris), beignet sampler.   Now I have never had beignets as good as at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans (and that's as it should be) - but the beignets here are creative and fun to share.

Apparently stuffing my face on Turkey and mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving wasn't enough, so Alex O. and I wandered off to Brenda's on Black Friday for brunch. What a feast! We figured there'd be no wait (or a short one at most). We were right. We put our names up on the chalkboard and waited about 15 minutes for our table to be ready. Crawfish beignets - hands down the best dish we tried. 3 fluffy pillows of dough sprinkled with a whole heck of a lot of cayenne. Delicious crawfish on the inside with cheddar and scallions. Creole Bloody Mary - rimmed the glass with cayenne and topped with okra. Yum! Red Beans and Rice - rich flavors of beans and andouille sausage. Not spicy. Gumbo - a tasty mix of chicken, okra and sausage. Shrimp and cheddar grits - not my favorite dish. It lacked something to make it pop. Flavors were a little disappointing compared to everything else. We took the leftovers (there were a lot) and lived off that for the rest of the day. Black Friday has a whole new meaning to me now.

Greatest. Place. Ever. Unfortunately, we live in the North Bay and don't get to eat here nearly often enough. A few weeks ago, like total creeps, we ate here for dinner and lunch again the next day. The shrimp poboy is my particular poison - the cornmeal breading is crunchy, not too thick, and not too salty. The catfish poboy is also fantastic, as are the red beans & rice. I think the only vegetarian option is a sweet potato dumpling dish with a sweet and savory corn maque choux that was just to die for. Oh, and the crawfish beignet! It's a fantastic twist on the traditional sweet beignet and is stuffed with cheese, spices, onions, and tasty little crawfish. Like its sweet cousin, though, it also features potentially dangerous powdery stuff on top. Hold your breath while bringing it up to your mouth. Trust me. Brunch has a whole other delightfully artery-clogging menu. The catfish benedict with a cream biscuit, perfectly poached egg, fried catfish, and hollandaise is totally worth the indulgence. As for dessert, I skip the beignets - they just don't compare to the real thing in NOLA. If you've never tried them, it's worth a taste. They're delicious, just not orgasm-in-my-mouth good like the real thing. The bread pudding du jour is another story, though. Seriously amazing. It's always the perfect balance of custardy and crusty and sticky, without ever getting too mushy or too hard.

If this review was based on the Crawfish Beignets alone, I'd give Brenda's 5 stars. The Crawfish Beignets were amazing, perfectly thick crunchy fritters filled with delicious crawfish and cheese. The thick layer of paprika was a little overwhelming, but it definitely topped each fluffy pillow with a spice kick. Me and my friend also ordered Shrimp & Grits and an Egg and Bacon Tartine. The shrimp and grits was okay, I loved the tomato, bacon, and shrimp, but it wasn't spectacular or particularly great. The Egg and Bacon Tartine was good as well. I'm a huge fan of bacon, so I loved it, but the potato side and eggs were just average. Overall, This place is pretty great. I highly recommend the beignets, and I expect to order the beignet flight on my next visit. The staff is exceptionally friendly and you get attended well. They are rather busy, but I can't blame them!

My girlfriend and I came here first morning of 2013, we waited about 15 minutes. First timers to this place, we wanted to start off the year with a great breakfast since i am no the best chef. The menu had soooo many choices of intriguing items, i was trying to figure out what i wanted while my girlfriend was ordering. I ordered grillades and grits, DELICIOUS! I like the vibe and scenery. ONLY problem is...when i return, i will have to order something different off the menu because there are sooooo many delicious choices to choose from. When the food tastes as great as it did, i couldn't imagine many bad options.

Was super excited to try out Brenda's after one of my best friends told me about the place. Been yelping up the pictures and reviews since the night before. Woke up early just to make sure that our party of four would be there before the Sunday church-crowd-rush. The decor gave off a refreshing feeling and it felt cozy and nice (if that makes sense.) I really liked the collaboration of mirrors on the big spacious wall, it really made the whole place open up. Our party of four decided to "family style" our orders so we can try a bit of everything, + Watermelon Ice Tea. It was very refreshing and the best part is that our drinks were refillable with no extra charge, my boyfriend had four glasses! + Crawfish Beignets. Simply delicious, the texture of the fried dough worked perfectly with the creaminess of the sauce and crawfish that was on the inside. + Garlic Shrimp Gratin. Best friend recommended to try this, but I feel like it just tasted like a fried shrimp sandwich. This dish wasn't anything special, don't think I would want to try again. More so a overly priced fried shrimp sandwich. + Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict. It was good, but I wouldn't say I was wow'd by it. Though, I must say that it was very interesting first experience since I never had a eggs benedict with fish before. + Beignet. It was just okay for me, but that's just my opinion since I'm not even a fan of doughnuts. But, my friends really liked it. So, I suppose this is a hit or miss depending if you like doughnuts. The service was great. The service was fast and friendly, our watermelon ice teas were never left empty for more than a few minutes! After our meal, the line was crazy outside, I'm glad that we beat the church crowd.

Besides the wait to get a table at this place, it 100% lives up to its reputation. Since we knew we were going to have to wait, we came prepared for it. The food was excellent and very unique. The French and the soul food were both well represented on the menu. I tried the pulled pork eggs benedict and my wife had the pork belly cheese grits, both very well prepared and tasty.

I came here with the BF for dinner before watching a show at the Orpheum theater.  We arrived before 6 PM, so there wasn't a wait at all.  I noticed that the crowd started coming in after 6 o'clock, so come early if you want to avoid the long wait.  The tables are cramped together and it's not the most comfortable place to enjoy your meal, but the food here was enjoyable. They start each table off with some fried black-eyes peas and they were seasoned well.  We ordered the Oyster Flight, which comes with a total of three oysters, each one prepared differently.  It's a good way to sample their oyster offerings.  The oysters were succulent, but if you like the classic raw oyster with lemon, you will find the oyster taste buried in sauce.  We also had the gumbo.  I liked it.  It was spicy with a good amount of andouille sausage.  And especially good on a cold night.  We each ordered a Crawfish Beignet and we did not expect it to be so ginormous.  We should've just ordered one and shared.  For me, it was too doughy and not enough filling to be satisfying.  The cayenne pepper sprinkled on top did not give it adequate spice.  It can quickly fill one up with all that extra dough.  Lastly, we shared the crawfish and andouille pot pie, a special they had that night.  It was nothing like a chicken pot pie.  The crust was not puff pastry.  It was more like bread-y.  The inside was not creamy like you would expect a pot pie to be.  It was soupy, almost tasted like the gumbo we had.  It still had good flavors though. The prices here are relatively fair, not expensive.  I did expect the food to be better with all the good reviews I read ahead of time.  Brenda's is not bad, but they can do better.

Went there for dinner with a friend and the food was good! But nothing to send me over the moon. We had shrimp and grits (still don't fully get the grit phenomenon - they taste bland to me and then oily when you add butter) beignets were good! Their french onion soup was disappointing. Too much peppercorn/mustard. I haven't had brunch there but I hear that this is what they are famous for.

Another over-hyped, over-rated, under performing restaurant.  Seriously, this is another in a long list of restaurants that think they're being creative with their menu... they sound good on paper and fall flat on your palate.  Food was dry, overcooked, poorly seasoned and ...given all the hype...the crawfish beignets were the biggest disappointment.  If all you need is Old Bay Seasoning to get excited about your creole food...then this is your place.  Ugh... and the beignet...there are half a dozen places in the city that make it better. French Soul Food?!  Sorry...not French...Cajun...nice try...totally lacks Soul. The service was as bad as the food.  We got there just before opening and were promptly seated with a couple other tables.  We thought we were lucky...until...our waitress couldn't get out of her own way, completely mismanaged everything.  I don't get it...place wasn't slammed...and she wasn't alone.  I expected better from a place with so many "quality" reviews. Why do people line up here?  There are FAR BETTER places in the Tenderloin... especially if you not afraid to explore the neighborhood.

Oh beignets and biscuits. How I love you so for brunch at Brenda's. Those are my must-order items at Brenda's, beignets and biscuits. The flight is a nice variety, but even too big for two people to finish if we order an entree. Not complaining. The crawfish beignet is insanely good, with its gooey, cheesy interior oozing with chunks of crawfish that provide a nice flavor contrast, and dusted with cayenne which provides a touch of heat. Who knew that a beignet could be so complex? My second favorite is the apple cinnamon beignet, but the crawfish beignet takes first place by far. And then there are the biscuits. It's so hard to ever find biscuits so flaky that I've given up trying, I'll just come to Brenda's. These are cream biscuits that are heavy on the butter. Tastes like flaky pie crust, my sister says. So amazing that I dream about them... Okay maybe not, but I do crave them from time to time. So there you have it, I can almost give this establishment five stars just for the items mentioned above. But I haven't even yet described the charming atmosphere that the place carries. It's like you stepped into a New Orleans themed restaurant, with coffee cannisters holding the silverware and antique-y decor that brings life and identity to the small, tightly packed restaurant. The friendly servers add to the whole environment and make it a destination brunch spot. If you're looking to indulge in high-fat, artery-clogging grub with the Cajun touch that brings you back to N'awlins... then the wait, my friend, is worth it.

I really like Brenda's just because the service is exceptional! Mixed that into some good food, and you have yourself a great time! Went there last Sunday when it was pouring out, but that didn't stop crazy San Franciscans (myself included) to enjoy a nice brunch while catching up with old friends. I'm not sure if it was due to the weather, but parking was a breeze! There are a bunch of metered spots within the vicinity. Waiting for a table, on the other hand, did not take as fast. However, the host was extremely friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We ordered the beignet sampler - original, chocolate, apple, and the very famous crawfish beignet. I would recommend to skip the first three, and just order a platter of the crawfish beignets - they are SOOOOOOO good. I ordered the french toast with butter pecan sauce and a biscuit on the side. The french toast was alright, but the butter pecan sauce was amazing! If you are thinking about getting the french toast, don't even think about NOT pairing it with the butter pecan sauce - you'd be missing out (.. i mean, unless you were allergic to pecans or something. Then tough luck) Their biscuit was fluffy and good, but not to die for. It was just a good salty option after eating all the sweet flavors from my french toast. Overall, I'd definitely come back. I want to try those oyster po'boys everyone is raving about ;)

I want my boyfriend to propose with a diamond ring inside a crawfish beignet. My head might explode. My man and I waltzed into Brenda's slim, fit, and wide awake on a beautiful SF Sunday morning, and waddled out about 10 lbs heavier, dragging our feet with our eyes wide shut. But were we happy? Hell yes. Give yourself the indulgent treat of a Brenda's BEIGNET FLIGHT - don't make the same mistake we did, and split the beignets for two followed by two separate entrees. Each beignet is about the size of your head (okay my head. I have a small head. but the beignets are still freaking huge!) The crawfish beignet easily takes first place, but the chocolate and apple-filled beignets come in a close second. The plain beignet is delightful, but once you have the crawfish, you can never go back to plain. It's like giving up a night with jake gyllenhaal for 'The Situation'. Can't go wrong with entrees like the PULLED PORK BENEDICT. Creamy velvety yolk seeping through the nooks and crannies of the fluffiest pillowiest biscuit I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. All topped off with delectable pulled pork. Also went with the HANGTOWN FRIED OYSTER OMELETTE, which I totally loved, but wouldn't order again. My bf barely touched it, so do with that what you will. Even though I had to put up with my man complaining about his belly for the rest of the day (as if I forced those multiple beignets down his throat), the experience was TOTALLY worth it. The wait seems daunting but we were seated pretty quickly. Service is fab, and the food is worth the wait.

This place is definitely worth trying.  We ordered the salad (there's only one), fried chicken and the shrimp grits.  Let me tell you, they were all good.  The salad was just right and it was different.  The salad came with this crossaint with some delish cheese. Yummo!  My fried chicken was good, but I have to say, the star of our meal was the shrimp and grits.  I never really had grits, but my experience was good.  I've heard that this is the best one and I believe it.  My wife couldn't believe how good it was. It was flavorful and robust. I gave it a 4 star because of the price and service size.  My 3 piece fried chicken (it was more like 2 pieces really) with fries was over $15.  Too expensive.  Then the shrimp in the grits were like 3 tiny pieces.  Really.  We had to look for them. But overall, this place is worth a try.

Long wait like most good SF brunch places. Went to Philz coffee nearby which had a line out the door. When we got back with coffees in hand we were seated. They don't want you to bring outside food/beverages in so we had to drink our coffees quickly because we were seated right away. I would say it was about an hour wait.  We had a savory beignet to start, I wasn't into the seafood stuffed pastry for breakfast but my companion liked it, it was heavy on the seasoning, I want to say paprika?. I also had their special pumpkin pancake which I thought was very doughy and more like a cake than a pancake, couldn't finish it. My breakfast date had the pulled pork benedict which was also a special and the pork sauce flavor overpowered the whole dish. Overall, the food is very rich southern style, if you are into that I would go. It's hard to judge a place by their specials, I'm sure their stuff on their regular menu is better put together.

I'm not really sure what "soul food" means, but if it's what makes you happy and content, this is it! I came here with 5 other friends and we all ordered different things: Beignet Flight, Hangtown Fry, Housemade Granola Pancakes with Fruit, Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette, Catfish Po'boy and Pork Belly special.

This place is to die for amazing! Do you have to wait long? Yes.  Do you cheer every time a name on the chalkboard is called off because that means they are getting closer to your name? Yes.  Is it worth the wait? ABSOLUTELY! Once you get inside you will be overwhelmed by the food coming out of the kitchen going to the surrounding tables.  You will hear lots of oohs and ahhs. Gawking will be had and after all that time of waiting you will wonder if you should really get what you had planned on getting for the last hour plus wait. I am hear to tell you that it doesn't matter what you get because it will be amazing.  However, some things you really shouldn't miss are the flight of beignet's.  You can even eat the hot crawfish one now and they will pack the rest up for you in a to-go bag.  Other highlights: fried chicken eggs benedict (on a biscuit), grillades and grits (my favorite), pulled pork and grits (a special). Also, don't miss the delicious bloody mary.

Man oh man oh man was Brenda's worth the 3-4 pounds I gained during dinner. I came with six other people and as usual, we ordered family style (which I recommend for a place this awesome to try EVERYTHING!!!)...  actually, I just dominated the menu and did the ordering.  What can I say, my friends have faith in me. There are so many great things about Brenda's (besides the wait during Brunch... I have waited but not yet tried).  The service is super friendly and attentive, even though the place was swamped in the middle of a Saturday dinner rush.  The atmosphere is perfect for a fun, great dinner.  Enough with that, on to the food! Just to save time, I will just preface that everything we ordered was amazing!  A couple of standouts: -Crawfish Beignets (no other asides needed) -Hush puppies (super good crunchy amazingtastic!!!) -Pork Shoulder -Ribs (super succulent, tender, smokey and perfect bbq sauce) -BFC -The Bacon-Collard Greens that come with the BFC (holy crap best collard greens I have ever had) -Cream biscuit with the STRAWBERRY JAM (it was sooo good I had caps it) -Catfish Des Allemands   You can do no wrong by ordering any of these items. Other honorable mentions: -Any of the Oysters (cayenne butter sauce was my favorite) -Fried Green Tomatoes (crunchy crispy batter and amazing chipotle sauce) -Gumbo -Red Beans & Rice (creamy and smoky!) -Mac & Cheese If you are anywhere near San Francisco, MAKE A TRIP TO BRENDA'S and pig out!

Beignets are huge! They can be a meal all by themselves for one person. The beignet flight is a good start if you want to try all the flavors although the crawfish is the best in my opinion. We went back twice in the span of 1 week because we couldn't resist. We ordered the hangtown fry (scrambled eggs with oysters), catfish Benedict, fried chicken Benedict, crispy pork belly on grits, and the French toast. If you get the French toast, make sure to get the pecan sauce on the side otherwise it'll be way too sweet. The pecan sauce is also AMAZING like crack. Tastes just like butterscotch candy. The waitlist chalkboard looks really daunting but the wait wasn't too bad. Both times we went, we waited one hour and practically all columns of the waitlist were filled with names except for the last column.

High five to the waitress who suggested we stop at three items for two people. Monday 11am was a 15 min wait. Big ass portions. Cheapo prices. Hangtown fry and crawfish beignet, if you are unsure. Just get those. Again, hangtown fry and crawfish beignet. Do it.

Lucky us! My party arrived around 830AM on a Saturday, right before the crowd rushed in! Loved the lighting here! Seriously great place for pictures (so tourist friendly). The atmosphere was awesome! Ordered the following: 1. Watermelon iced tea - it had a bitter taste to it (i love bittersweet drinks) but it wasn't as refreshing as I thought it would be. I would like to try this again. 2. Fluffy buttermilk pancake - it was not fluffy and it tasted uncooked. We could not comprehend how the pancakes went all wrong. 3. Shrimp & goat cheese omelette - this was topped with caramelized onion & tomato bacon relish. There was too much goat cheese for me to handle, but I loved my omelette regardless. We also had another omelette dish, but I forgot the name. It was pretty yummylicious too! I wanted to try their infamous beignets but it was already tough for me to eat breakfast (not used to it), so I had to let it go. Next time, I promise. Though not all of our choices were exactly delightful, I still love Brenda's. Why? Because of their morning-friendly environment. Because of their tomato bacon relish on my omelette. So amazing. It made my omelette THE omelette--the best I ever had. I went on an omelette craze after visiting Brenda's and seriously, no place can top it. I even tried replicating the tomato bacon relish and it's no match. Duh. Sometimes, all it takes is one HIT dish for you to come back. All hail the tomato bacon relish!

I've been wanting to eat here forever - or at least since I heard the words "Crawfish Beignets." My friend and I ate here pre-Giants Parade, and sat right down!  We ordered something savory (the Hangtown Fry) and something sweet (the Pumpkin Pancakes).  I desperately wanted some Crawfish Beignet action but the mood wasn't right... I'll be back for you little darlings.   The Hangtown Fry was all kinds of right.  Whoever thought to put fried oysters in an egg scramble needs a prize.  The Pumpkin Pancakes were good, but only for about two or three bites - SO SWEET and way too thick.  But the Mimosas were perfect!

Scribble your name on the chalkboard and expect to wait! I felt groups of 2 were called out quicker than larger groups. I highly suggest coming here starving because the food will fill you up! My friend and I ordered one Dungeness crab beignet (a special) and an order of the crawfish beignets (comes in 3). We left with a box of 2! Trust me, order the beignets and share an entree! I enjoyed the Dungeness crab beignet over the crawfish flavored one. Both flavors were amazing, but felt the crawfish had a bit too much paprika. The best part? Cutting it in half and seeing the insides ooze out! Yum!!!!

French Soul is tough to find on the west coast.  And it was good! Big portions (almost too large) and very tasty.  I just cannot get the soul food from Savannah, GA out of my head, and Brenda's does not quite compare.  Be prepared for LINES. Go on a week day around lunch time for the quickest seating.

My FAVORITE brunch place in the city. Yes, there are no bottomless mimosas, but they have a damn good blood mary. First of all, you have to get the beignets. The crawfish beignets are to die for. Next, you can't go wrong with any egg dishes. I especially like the fried catfish eggs benedict ($11) and  the egg and bacon tartine ($9.50). The shrimp and grits ($12) and hangtown fry ($11) are delicious as well. I just recently came here for dinner as well. I expected long lines like brunch time. However, I was pleasantly surprised with no lines at all. Please get the fried chicken. You cannot go wrong. I cannot recommend this place enough!

To die for place, seriously! The environment is simple but warm and welcoming. The staff has always treated me very well and been there at just the right time and never hovering. I've had several meals here and would  recommend just about everything on the menu. When in doubt with the beignets just order the sampler and eat them all! The only drawback for me, especially on weekends is the parking and long line situation. If it wasn't for these factors this place is clearly a 5 star kinda place, without question.

Spontaneous brunch on a Saturday landed me at the steps of Brenda's! Based on all the raves I've heard, was pretty darn excited to try this place. Waited about an hour, good thing it was a nice day outside. I tried the following: - Sweet Flight - this is not on the menu, but basically it's a trio of the sweet beignets. our waiter told us that was an option after seeing us struggle with trying to decide between three single flavored sweets and the one of every flavor (but being unsure about the crawfish one). These came as plain, chocolate, and apple cinnamon. Overall all quite good, the dough is soft and they're so good when they first bring them out! - Seafood Frittata - I wasn't sure what a frittata was, but it was on the specials menu and so I decided to give it a try. This came out something like a flat pancake-like omelette with seafood in it. Oh and loaded with cheese on top. Definitely heavy lunch, but was quite tasty. Came with some well seasoned hash potatoes and a biscuit (you could choose toast as well). Biscuit was great, didn't have a strong butter smell, but still tasted wonderful. - Watermelon tea - thankfully light and not syrupy, very refreshing :) Overall experience was great and food is very reasonably priced. Will be back despite the wait!

mmmm I never had french soul food before, but it was delicious! Arrived around 1 and the wait was realli long, u write ur name on a chalk board nd u jss wait around nd they call u.  The restaurant isn't all that big so we ended up having to wait like 45 minutes.  The hostess the dood wit glasses is real rude nd not very welcoming that is prollie my only complaint about this place.  But the food is soo good we had the crawfish beignet, the gumbo, nd the croque monsieur.  everythign tasted so awesome i wanted to keep eating nd eating but i ran outa room in my stomacheeeeee =[.  Also, their bloody mary is prollie the best i ever had shit was spicy nd tasty nd wonderful.

This review is only for the crawfish beignets. We were too full to eat anything else as this was the 3 stop on our food adventure. Came here with a friend and decided to order some crawfish beignets to go. It was a cold day and when these warm delicious beignets came out, we were thrilled. Took a bite and I swear I was standing there in silence as I was savoring it. The crawfish filling was absolutely amazing and it was like biting into a warm donut. Didn't need any dipping sauce and it brought me back to when I was in New Orleans where it's the real deal cajun/creole cuisine. If you go to Brenda's, the crawfish beignets are a must try. You won't be disappointed.

If you do not eat here, you are NOT having one of the BEST meals available in SF!!!!!! No one can touch Brenda's for breakfast or brunch.  Since the day she opened she has been in the top 5 of BEST SF eats! Now if you walk in, you will probably have to wait about 45 minutes or so for a table. You can order a to-go and have about a 10 minute wait. BEST thing to do is CALL AHEAD! Yes you can get your name on the list so you don't have to wait. Again, if you are in SF you MUST go here!

I have heard good things about this place and finally had a chance and the time to check it out.  I was prepared for the long wait and oh boy, it was quite a wait.  Luckily, Philz coffee was a few blocks away and we decided to hit Philz and then go back.  We both ordered the crispy belly pork with cheddar grits and OMG!!  it was mouth watering!!  We had the apple beignet first and we made sure we didn't get too full before our main course.   It was definitely worth the long wait in the rain and the cold and would love to come back and try everything in their menu.  Had to take one star off due to the wait but otherwise, it's one of the best places to for brunch :)

Okay. It's official. I've eaten here 3-4 times now and I can say I just don't get what all the brouhaha is all about. The only answer I can come up with is that it's just not a good place for non-meat eaters. Yes, the beignets are awesome and the chickory coffee is awesome, but I haven't really enjoyed the rest of the menu. I've tried an omelet. I've tried the shrimp and grits (with bacon) and I've tried a veggie sloppy Joe and it's just not worth it for me.

my first time eating soul food! Shared the Beignet Flight ($9) - 3 stars! Comes with 4 of the filled dougnuts. We subbed out the apple one with an extra crawfish for $1 more. I definitely liked the crawfish one the best but the dough gets very filling and its almost too much by the time i had 4 bites. id rather just eat the inside and nibble on the dough. Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict ($11) - 4 stars! This dish was pretty damn good. I got it with the side of grits and it was delicious. Hangtown Fry ($11) - 3 stars! This was my boyfriends dish. I thought it was okay. the fried oysters inside the scramble was very interesting. and im not a big fan of bacon =/ He also got the hash over the grits.. big mistake!

A great brunch spot worth the 40 minute wait - if you're in the area, it's definitely worth a stop if you've got the time. The crawfish beignet is definitely worth ordering - it had a rich and flavorful filling, although the filling ratio to the beignet could be a bit higher. The chocolate beignet also takes a close second, with a deep dark chocolate filling. The Hangtown Fry is decent, filled with fresh, high quality fried oysters, briny while still retaining a slight crunch from the coating, but nothing too special. The biscuits are light and fluffy with a tender, buttery crumb - much better than settling for just toast. Overall, the food is good with great prices, it's a place I'd probably be a regular at if I lived in the neighborhood.

I make a yearly trip to the Bay area to visit a good girlfriend of mine, and she took me here promising that it was awesome. And really, it's soul food and brunch, so I wasn't in any position to say no! You need to fuel up before a marathon shopping session! She warned me that the wait here is awful on weekends, but as we came at about 10-11 on a Monday, it wasn't too bad. The place is still quite busy, but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. Now be warned, this place is popular, and quite small. We wound up sort of almost sharing a table with the couple who had come in right after us. So don't be too picky about personal space at this place. We got the flight of beignets, she the croque monsieur and mine was a special- the roasted pork belly on a bed of grits with a poached egg. The beignets were great- HUGE and fresh and honestly more than we could eat. If you like savories like me I'd recommend actually skipping the flight and just getting the crawfish. That was easily my favorite of the bunch. I also go to nibble on the plain and the chocolate filled. It was all very good. I didn't get to taste her croque monsieur, but I will gladly wax poetic about my dish. I adore grits, and pork belly, and poached eggs. The pork belly was this enormous hunk of crispy, fatty, melty goodness, and the poached egg and grits and cheese were great. If I did have to be picky I'd say I'd prefer a bit less cheese, but really, that's just nitpicking. The taste was great. Oh, and if you're a skin fanatic like me eat it first. I got to it last and it was soggy by then, but I think that was a user error, not one from the kitchen. For our drinks we got the watermelon sweet tea. Neat, and good, but... eh. Okay. It was a touch too strong for my taste- it had a bit of that nasty tannic taste you get when you brew teabags too long. Overall, a 3.5 rounded up to a 4. Good, I want to come back here again, but not without its flaws.

Looking for something a bit different than your typical brunch? This would be the place to go! Long lines on the weekend, but after 1:30 it's not so bad. We waited 15min tops which was a good thing since I was starving! The decor is nice and I like the variety of mirrors that hang from the wall. Service was excellent and attentive. We ordered the crawfish beignets and didn't realize how big they were! 3 huge pieces came out and we could only get 1.5 down so that we could save our appetite for the main course. Their grits were awesome and perfectly cooked along with their pork belly. They're known for their beignets but I think all of their food is great and wouldn't mind coming back again!

went to brenda's for an early saturday breakfast.   we ordered: -cafe au lait - not the best i had, should have ordered an chicory coffee instead -cappuccino - pretty, foamy, and yummy -beignet flight - sampler of all 4 beignets: plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish.  hubby thoroughly enjoyed the apple, think hot apple pie, while my fav was the crawfish, the only savory, cheesy, and creamy beignet in the sampler.  beignets were fresh and pipping hot, good for the west coast but no cafe du monde. -shirmp and grits - oh so yummy and a huge portion as well!  had to take 2/3 of it home...which was a good thing cause it only got better a couple days later.  the grits were cheesy and flavorful, the gravy was not too heavy, and the shrimps were cooked perfectly.  will go back for the shrimp and grits alone...and will have a separate order to-go! -side order of bacon - crispy, fatty, goodness! overall: service was excellent.  the waitress was happy to give us change for parking...which was a plus.  place gets packed for brunch so get there early!

Damn that's good gumbo! I think its the best I've had in the Bay actually. We also order the chicken which was good, but not as good as Sandra Dee's! The ice tea tasted like medicine to me so I stuck to my water. We order the beignet with crab which was pretty good and decided to order the desserts beignets after our meal. When the 3 arrived they looked off and we realized why. One of the three was actually a crawfish beignet and when we brought it to our server's attention she was surprised.  Kinda funny how the chefs can miss that... They even put powdered sugar on it! Besides the mix up the food was great, you can skip on the tea and make sure your hungry!

I can haz all of the foods Brenda? I've been to a lot of brunch spots.. most are okay, a few are great and even fewer are really special and unique. Brenda's falls into the special and unique category. It's worth the long wait in line and it inspired me to make my own beignets. You should probably try everything here... maybe not all at once though.

At my most recent visit, I ordered the catfish eggs benedict and it was delicious. The biscuits on the bottom are perfect and the potatoes that come with it are well cooked. The watermelon iced tea is the perfect accompaniment for brunch. They had crab beignets as a special so we ordered that and it was SUPER YUMMY. Another time I came they had really delicious fuji apple pancakes as a special but i can't remember when that was...must have been sometime in the fall - please bring that back! :D

Brenda's is a nice alternative to the traditional brunch. So many brunch places in the city have a really long line for basically the same food: eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, pancakes... It's heavy and it's boring and frankly I can make better at home without having to wait an hour in line. The Louisiana style items especially seafood are really good. They also do a range of the trendy pork based dishes  that seem to be de riguer these days: deep fried pork belly, pulled pork Eggs Benedict, excetera. Where I knock them is that everything's a little too heavy, and you'll be hard pressed to find anything vegetable or not fried on the menu. Sure, homemade donuts great but that's not what I'm gonna have for brunch every weekend, especially when it's followed by butter drenched grits. Also, while I applaud them for their efficacy in getting people in and out the restaurant, I don't get why so many SF restaurants refuse to take reservations. It's just annoying. Once in a blue moon I'm willing to stand around for brunch on Sunday but I would go out way more often if you could get reservations. There are so many better things to do with your time.

Phenomenal! This was probably one of the top-3 breakfasts I've had in my life. No joke! The food was so good that I don't think I could have been more happy with my order. Just so you know, I ordered the Grillades breakfast dish under the 'House Specials' of the menu.  This dish came with 2 eggs, a creamy biscuit, steak in a delicious Cajun sauce, and a Polenta style creamy/corn type substance (forgive me for not remembering exactly what was in that). Take my word for it though, the meal was outstanding. I think if you typically like spicy & cajun style food (like I do) then you can't go wrong by having the breakfast here. This establishment also played some old Mo-town hits which was nostalgic, of course. And there was real buzz inside the restaurant. It was clear that everyone was excited to be here, and so was I. Lastly, this place is notorious for super long lines to get a table on the weekends. If you come here during the week then you can avoid some of the big crowds and still have an excellent meal for a price that's well worth it. I'm a huge fan of Brenda's now.

There's a certain zest about walking around the Tenderloin. I got off the Civic Center BART station and started walking on Market. Almost immediately, I was hit with the stench of urine and body odor. It was accompanied by the following: "Hey you got money?" "Hey you got some food?" "Hey you got some drink?" "What you got?" "You at least got some love for me?" The homeless are different in San Francisco versus the homeless in NYC. I wanted to take a picture of a woman whose hair resembled Bride of Frankenstein. It stood straight up, tangled and sticky from all the grime, complete with a white stripe. But before this turns into a commentary about the homeless or provokes hate mail on how insensitive I am being, I will get back to Brenda's. Brenda's French Soul Food will take you out of the TL and put you in New Orleans. Thank you Chef Brenda Buenviaje for bringing some creole cooking to San Francisco. Plus, she's Filipina. Woo hoo! +1 for my culture. It was hard to make a decision on what to get since I heard everything was good but I settled on the Catfish Po'boy for my lunch. Dishes here are massive and for a mere $10+. I really liked the French fries. They were spiced and my catfish sandwich was spot on. The bread was a little big so towards the end, I was just eating the catfish.  I also got BFC chicken wing. The fried chicken is so delicious. Finger lickin good like how Kentucky Fried Chicken was back in the day.   We had a variety of dishes on our table since we had a very large group. From muffaletta to sweet potato pancakes and shrimp and grits to jambalaya we had everything covered from sandwiches and savory dishes to breakfast foods. For the table to share we had the plain beignets and crawfish ones. OMG they were amazing especially the crawfish. My cousin said the crawfish was the best of all the choices but I want to find out for myself. Yes I want to try the apple and chocolate ones too! Don't deprive me! The line is long and the people come out in droves, even on a weekday. Brenda's does a great job on service, even with large groups. Our waitress had it all down to a science. Brenda's has you fed and on your way in no time, and you won't even feel rushed. I love San Francisco.

The hype drew me here and ultimately it disappointed. Unfortunately, large portions do not excuse lackluster flavors. Their beignets are plushy but quickly boring after a few bites with little reward and value. I would expect a place with such a highly rated crab beignet to be filled with scrumptious juicy crab meat and dusted with delicious spices, yet I got neither. Dishes were one-dimensional in flavor. Skip.

I've known about Brenda's for a while, but never wanted to wait in line. So when a girlfriend of mine was visiting and I had the Monday off, I thought, hey, why not try Brenda's? It shouldn't be too bad on a Monday morning, right? I scanned the reviews and decided we had to get there before 11:30 a.m. to beat the lunch crowd. We got there at 11 (found parking pretty easily, thank goodness) and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Here's what we got: - Sweet watermelon iced tea: if it's your first time, get this. I loved that they had pieces of watermelon and tasted really fresh. It wasn't super sweet either (think MickeyD's sweet tea), which was great. Free refills too, so why wouldn't you get this? - Beignet flight: I know ordering this would mean we probably wouldn't be able to finish the other stuff we ordered, but I didn't know when I would be back again. As I write this, I've tried the crawfish and the chocolate. The apple cinnamon and plain are sitting in my fridge (was wayyy too full). The crawfish was delicious - I've never had a crawfish beignet before, so have nothing to compare it to. They were generous with the crawfish, and it was the most flavorful thing I tried there. I recommend getting this one on the side, so it's not mixed with the other sweet beignets. The chocolate was good, but nothing extraordinary. I've definitely had fluffier (which I prefer). - Croque Monsieur: Ham and cheese on sourdough. Yes, I likey. It was good, but not phenomenal. You get your pick of fries or coleslaw for your side. - Pork Belly special: My girlfriend got this, and I had a bite of the grits. It was delish! It stood out more than the croque monsieur for sure. She said the pork belly was crispy and tasty. Overall, the food was good and it was definitely a solid 4 stars. I don't know if I would wait in line for an hour though. But if I had another Monday off... Yes, I'd be back :)

I hate to do this to Brenda.. but I have to give it a 3 star. I realize this is one of THE brunch places in SF, but I just didn't understand the hype during my visit. My partner and I came early, so we didn't have to wait for long. We also opted to sit at the counter (like we do so often at various restaurants), so we didn't have to put our name on the big chalkboard of patron names. Anyway, the menu sounded delicious and enticing, but we finally agreed on the crawfish beignet and shrimp & grits. Before Brenda's, I've never had a savory beignet, so I was hesitant and not sure if how this was going go.. To my surprise, the crawfish filling was tasty and cheesy. However, the beignet was just too heavy for my taste. The shrimp & grits was pretty delicious, but still quite heavy for brunch food. So while the food was okay, I just didn't think it was all that amazing for me to give it a four star.

This place truly exemplifies diamond in the rough. Located in the not so great neighborhood of Tenderloin around the downtown area. It was my friend's idea to come here since she previously had the beignets.  Unfortunately, we walked here all the from Union Square, which is a good 10 minute walk. I was a tourist and was rather scared of what I saw on my here. Finally we arrive and the inside of the place is spectacular, something I was not expecting based on the neighborhood. We ordered the beignets sample which included plain, berry filled (if I remember correctly), chocolate and craw fish?! The beignets were served along side with strawberry preserve. We start with the craw fish which was I thought was a unique savory twist on what is usually a dessert, tasted pretty good. The plain was good for what it was. The chocolate one was filled with heavy chocolate, I think it was Ghirardelli, but my favorite was the berry filled! The strawberry preserve was delicious and I would come here for that alone. I've always wanted to try creole cooking, but unfortunately we already ate lunch before coming and came here primarily for dessert. If I lived in SF I would definitely make this my first place to try creole cooking for sure. Highly recommend especially if your on the hunt to eat creole food.

If they had fresh squeezed orange juice and better potato hash this would be a five star review.  As it was, the service was outstanding and the food mostly fantastic.   We sat at the counter bar -- about 6 or 8 seats -- thought they were first come, but actually turned out to be part of the overall hostess seating scheme ... oops ... well we probably only cut in front of one other 2 top ... and the seats were right by the door (which by the way very few people had the sense to close on their way in or out) so it was cramped and cold (so that other 2 top should actually thank us for taking those seats). We ordered the plain beignets -- which are huge (too big) but delicious.  Perfectly fried and great texture.  They come topped with tons (again a bit too much) powdered sugar and nothing else.  Didn't realize the plastic jar in front of us was a cooked strawberry jam -- that would have been great on these beignets.  They have other beignets with fruits and chocolate. I had the andouille sausage, cheddar and scallion omelet as a scramble without mushrooms and the potato hash.  The eggs were fantastic -- lightly scrambled.  The potatoes were overcooked (mushy) and had way too much paprika for my liking.  It came with a huge, deliciously flaky biscuit. My husband had the croque monsieur with a bowl of fruit (special substitution).  It was fantastic -- perfectly broiled cheese on top of a moist, flavorful ham, cheese and bechamel. My husband's macchiato was very well prepared .. not a soap sud in sight in the foam. One unpleasant aspect was watching and smelling the refuse bins being rolled through the dining room (yes, through the packed dining room) to the truck waiting curb-side. Nonetheless, would definitely come back when in the city ...

Our party of nine had to wait about 40 mins for brunch table at 10:30am on a Monday in this really cute establishment, but hot dayamn, lemme tell you the food is worth the wait. What we swallowed: BEIGNET FLIGHT (5 stars): I was hesitant about ordering a mix as I just like my plain but I'm so glad I did. Each of them were scrumptious and I was surprisingly happy with the crawfish one, it was just perfectly seasoned with bits of crawfish in the middle. The plain was still to die for, followed by the Chocolate one and then the apple. If you indecisive or haven't had a these before, definitely go with the flight. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… BFC (4 stars): Two pieces of fried chicken, french fries, coleslaw, and a fluffly awesome biscuit. The chicken batter had a great flavor to them but it wasn't crispy and I thought was a big greasy. That dang biscuit was fluffy, scrumptious and to die for tho. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… CHICKEN ETOUFFEE (5 stars): Chicken creole gravy smothered over rice. Other than the Jambalaya, I would have to say this was the BEST dish out of all that I tasted. The marriage of the creole gravy was hearty and so addicting. This dish was heavenly! JAMALAYA (4.5): This was probably my second favorite dish on the table. So hearty and the flavors were really tasty. Very good dish. SHRIMP AND GRITS (4 stars): The grits were nicely seasoned and the shrimp wasn't chewy. FRENCH TOAST with BUTTER PECAN SAUCE (5 stars): Their frenceh toast is so damn addicting. Easy on the batter but nice, crisp edges. The butter pecan sauce was kick @ss. FRENCH TOAST with BANANAS FOSTER SAUCE (5 stars): Just when the french toast couldn't get any better, they added the bananas fosters on top. Dang. No maple syrup needed, these things were sweet but really addicting. The bananas were perfectly glazed and so delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… FLUFFY BUTTERMILK PANCAKES (4.5 stars): These were spot-on as well. Nice, perfectly fluffly pancakes with that homemade buttermilk taste to them. You can't go wrong with these. PORK PULLED SANDWICH (3 stars): I found that the sauce on these sandwiches were way to sweet and I couldn't even finish the bite that was given to me to share. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… RED BEANS AND RICE (3.5 stars): Your basic red beans and rice that's both tasty and delicious. We were so lucky to have so many options of dishes and try them all. The food here is so amazing and there really isn't a dish that is bad. If I had to do it all again, I would order the Beignet Flight, the Chicken Etoufee, and a big, nice fluffy biscuit. DELICIOUS INDEED!!!

I had a better experience that my friend and girlfriend. It was worth the 1 1/2 hour wait to get a table. My girlfriend and I split the flight of beignet which include a regular, chocolate filled, apple filled, and crawfish filled beignet. The crawfsih was absolutely delicious! I could eat it every single day! I also ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached and topped with one of the best hollandaise sauce i have had! It came with a side of grits, but i asked to have the Shrimp and Grits which was accommodated. The grits were so good, but I was only able to take a few bites because there was so much food. Final Thoughts: I would gladly return to Brenda's and wouldn't mind the long wait time to get a table!

Whenever I come here, I always order the shrimp and grits. Its hot, oozy, cheesy, and just absolutely tasty! There are chunks of bacon, tomatoes, and several plump and juicy shrimp.  The portions is plenty enough for me to eat for lunch and dinner. Also, do not forget to order the watermelon iced tea. It's refreshing and not too sweet.  Don't worry, they give refills so drink away. Other tasty dishes: 1) Crawfish Beignets: Crunchy on the outside, and warm and gooey with cheese and crawfish on the inside. 2) Oysters: Only served during dinner. One order is actually a bunch of small oysters inside one big oyster shell.  I prefer the bbq one. 3) Andouille omelet: They don't skimp on the toppings at all. Most of the dishes here are about $10-15, but the portions are generous.

Must. Come. Back. Oh wow, brunch here was FANTASTIC. The wait was totally worth it! I like the method - put your name on the chalkboard and wait your turn. Took me and my boyfriend maybe 30 minutes, and it was an exceedingly nice day, so no biggie. People were outside chilling, some enjoying their coffee or the watermelon iced tea. I had to try that and WOW it was so good. Everything here was just YUM. I had the shrimp and grits, and my boyfriend had one of the sandwiches...anyway, he couldn't finish his food and neither could I. We also ordered a couple of the biscuits and they were AMAZING. So pillowy and warm, butter melted right on...oh...so good. Mouth happy. Must go back.

Believe the hype, y'all. This place is delicious and the service is fantastic. Not a cheap diner-type breakfast, so don't wander in there expecting to get a breakfast for under $10. I was dead-set on trying beignets but after their huge serving of french toast I couldn't indulge in anything else. I will be going back to try their other dishes, because it was just that good. I got there on a Sunday around 10 and was seated right away, just before the rush started. The food is worth the wait, though.

The first time I went to this place, I thought it was amazingly good, but the past few times I've gone, I've been feeling more like it's not that special afterall and way heavier and greasier than I'd like to eat. The grits are a yummy treat, but just expect very greasy. The beignet flight is worth getting, but with other people! I guess it's great southern food for SF!

We stopped in here for dinner one night and it was crazy busy. They had literally just opened and there was a line out the door. Luckily for us it was only a 15min wait or so. I could see how the wait time could be a big problem, especially if you are hungry! But hey, it really says something about the caliber of food if there are so many people willing to wait for it. I started out with a spicy bloody Mary. They also have Abita beer, which is made in Louisiana. I had the fried chicken. So juicy and moist with that crispy skin...yum. It also came with a giant biscuit and some pretty kick ass red pepper jelly. I couldn't resist. Instead of the greens I substituted the mac and cheese. I would say that was a great trade! We are talking home made, like your mom used to make, mac and cheese. Of course I had to go home with a to go bag. It made an excellent lunch the next day too. My husband had the catfish po boy. I'm not a huge fan of catfish, but I thought it was pretty darn good. We opted to take half of our dinner meals home because we couldn't pass up the beignets. Maybe it's just me, but why go to an authentic Louisiana kitchen and not have a traditional dish. We went for the chocolate. So worth it.

Came on the weekday, no wait. They don't serve benedicts on weekdays.. yeah I was sad :( Crawfish beignets are a must. The beignets were a lot bigger than I expected.. and amazingly delicious. If you want a refreshing drink, try the watermelon tea. It is unique and really good! Free refills, too. Ordered the shrimp and grits, which was okay. I thought the shrimps were kind of small, and there was an excessive amount of cheese on top of the dish. It was really greasy but the flavors they incorporated were delicious. My friend ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich which was mediocre at best. My other friend got Muffaletta Sandwich. It was so oily that the oil was dripping down her arm.

I've seriously been yelp stalking brenda's for at least three years now and haven't had the chance to make my way out there. Well, last week I was out in the city super early to see Daw Aung San Suu Kyi speak (I know, you're horribly jealous and yes it was just as amazing as it sounds) and called up some friends to finally try Brenda's. There was about a 40 minute wait, and we decided to duke it out. Grab some coffee from philz beforehand to hold you over. Once we sat down, we opted to share the beignet combo (comes with a crawfish, apple, chocolate, and plain) and each ordered our own dishes. the beignets. oh my gahdddd. The crawfish beignet is the real winner in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so you can take that statement with a grain of salt. The beignets are so soft and airy, surprisingly not as heavy as I thought they would be. i did try a bite of the other ones and they were all very tasty. I opted for the crispy pork belly over cheesy grits (what diet?) and it was delicious. The grits were the perfect consistency and there was a generous amount of cheese, the pork belly stayed crispy and there was a savory sauce on top of all that. Yummy, hit-the-spot comfort food. I can't wait to come back.

7x7 100 Best Things to Eat In SF Before You Die #__ Crawfish Beignets at Brenda's French Soul Food Went here with Anthony P and his girlfriend a few weeks back. Being the fatty that I was, I had to order my own Beignet Flight which consisted of one plain, one Ghiradelli chocolate, one filled with granny smith apple and of course one Crawfish. I have to say my favorite had to be the crawfish. It was spiced well and had adequate filling. However, I do wish there was actually more filling because my ratio was 75% Beignet and only 25% crawfish stuffing. I would easily order this again. I also ordered the Grillades & Grits-beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy, served with grits & two eggs any style plus biscuit or toast. To finish off my meal, I also got Watermelon Tea. Yeah, I was a little heffer that day but I figure if I waited that long I was going to try what I wanted! The grillades were ok, definitely wasn't a fan of the meats texture and found the flavor to be a little muted. I expected the gravy to have more of a punch but instead it tasted like any other gravy. As for the biscuit, it was good compliment to my dish. I was able to try my friends Shrimp and Grits which was 100x better than what I got. It is served with an amazing spicy tomato bacon gravy. It is sinfully delicious, smokey, savory bacon-y goodness. I normally don't like grits but Brenda's certainly did change my mind with that gravy! The portions are definitely good but mind you that breakfast fare generally isn't that expensive so they are able to offer slightly larger portions to justify their price points. You will get full, that is for certain! Overall Thoughts The long wait time can leave something to be desired but there is a Philz really close by so while you wait go ahead and treat yourself to a great cup of coffee

Meh. I've definitely had experience better CUSTOMER SERVICE.   You just don't know how excited I was to try this place.  I get it, there's a long wait.  And I was willing to wait, unfortunately his and mine's lunch time date led to ordering to-go.  We had just ordered - like 2 minutes ago, when a bunch people were called and were no longer in attendance and so the wait list was moving very fast.  We thought we asked to eat there and enjoy eating at a table.  2 minutes seriously... so I asked the hostess and explained to her that we just had ordered and was wondering if we could eat at a table as our names were next.   She said no. She gave me a spiel about the order already being taken in and that they can't do that.  Umm ok.  I guess its their policy.   But no wait... she kept talking and then asked where I was in the wait list. I pointed towards my name and then she said "even if i you could I wouldn't be able to seat you two for another 20-25 minutes."   Ok stupid hostess, 1: you hardly looked where my name was placed 2: if you have a effin policy follow it and don't give me bullshit and possibly tease the fact that you may have consider seating us a table.   YOU WERE SO RUDE.   The food wasn't so bad.  I did like my to-go food, though I can say I have had a better croque monsiuer elsewhere and definitely better beignets (dogpatch).  He liked the watermelon pickle thingy and the coleslaw.     I would really like to return and try different items, but it'll be awhile before I go back and try.  I was really excited to go here and kept wanting a lunch date here and when my constant hints finally got through my lunch date wanted to take me here.

I'd heard about this place from a coworker and had been wanting to try it, but the rumors of long wait times had kept me away.  Until one weekday morning my wife and I were headed to our usual b'fast joint and found it closed.  The owners were on vacation.  Anyway, we weren't far from Brenda's and this seemed like good time to try it out.  When we got there amazingly no line and we were seated straight away.  Servers were on us the instant our butts hit the chairs.  Coffee was poured and at the first gulp I knew we were in for something good.  Our server asked if we'd been before and offered up some suggestions.  We started with the beignet assortment.  All were good, actually better than the one's in New Orleans.  We also ordered omelettes, which were also delicious, but after the beignet's we were too stuffed to finish.  Next time it will be one or the other.  There will definitely be a next time!

Went for brunch today, and it was good. We got there a little before noon, and were told the wait was maybe 40 minutes. So we went to the Farmer's Market, and came back just in time for our table. Once seated we had coffee, a seafood frittata with grits special, an andouille sausage side, a coleslaw side, and the 'beignet flight.' Frittata was not great, sausage not that spicy, coleslaw pretty good, grits yummy yummy yummy, cream biscuit that came with the special REALLY good...and homemade strawberry jam too ...but WOW the beignets!!!   WOW!!!! They were about the size of a baseball.  They were ginormous.  They were incredible. They were delicious.  They were more than enough with coffee for brunch for 3 people. Next time I'm going for dinner.  I'm going to have a poorboy and split the chocolate beignet for dessert. I'm pretty sure that'll be an amazing meal.  I can't wait! Aside:  Uhm, no.  There were no green things on the brunch menu.  Coleslaw was as close as they got. .

after hearing a lot about this place for its fried chicken, we finally got around to trying it out. the biscuit here was so good! easily the best biscuit in the bay area! the chicken was fried nicely and is cooked well and is juicy inside. however, its not my favorite. i didnt really care for the seasoning that it has on it. the fries that come with it are also fried nicely. the little melon things that come with the cole slaw were sort of wierd. overall, it was pretty good but i would probably try the other stuff as opposed to getting the fried chicken again.

Between our group of five, we shared an order of the Crawfish Beignets ($8 for 3), and then ordered the following: BFC (plus a couple extra pieces of chicken), Chicken Etoufee, Grillades & Grits, and the Hangtown Fry. For the most part, the food was all enjoyable, though the Hangtown Fry was probably the least favorite; it just wasn't "fun" by any means. But everything else was quite delicious... the etoufee, the creamy grits, and the beef cutlets were all tasty. The biscuit was surprisingly flaky and light. And the Crawfish beignets were so savory (though I did think it was too bready). Having said all that, I had to save the best for last. The fried chicken here is basically what you would come here for. It's what I would go back for. The breading and seasoning are terrific and the meat is so juicy. I only had a bite of my friend's (and I picked every crumb left on his plate... no joke), and that's enough to get me back to Brenda's the next time I'm in SF. Get the fried chicken; you won't regret it.

I highly recommend this place for a very filling breakfast or brunch if you have the time to wait.  The food focus is quasi new-French new-Southern leaning Soul but not quite there any of those.  Regardless of what you want to categorize the menu, the food is very rich and filling.   I would give this joint five stars, but I am subtracting one star for (1) the wait and (2) coffee not being refilled once during the entire meal.    The wait was about an hour and half.  Luckily, you are in the city and there is time to go stroll around, have coffee at another venue down the street (of SHOUT OUT to Philz Coffee - the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee was to die for!!!!!).  If you have somewhere to be in two hours, then I wouldn't even begin to think about coming here.  But if you have a free Sunday afternoon, it is worth the wait.   The service was great and no one wanted any more coffee, i was just surprised it wasn't refilled or asked for.   No biggie.   The Shrimp and Grits were great but very different from how I've had them in Charleston, South Carolina (amazing shrimp and grits there!).  Cheesy and full of bacon tomato spice magic.  The Catfish Benedict was yummy.  Kind of an odd pairing, but very tasty if your in the mood for some southern fried goodness.   1 mark against the potatoes.  They didn't taste bad, I just thought they could be a little warmer and a bit crunchier.  Just my opinion on potatoes....   I most certainly look forward to coming back here.   Stay hungry my friends.

Came here for dinner with a friend and got the fried chicken plate (BFC), hushpuppies, and sweet potato dumplings w/ shrimp and crawfish. Hushpuppies were really good but not the best I've had. 4 large ones come in an order. The fried chicken plate had three huge pieces of chicken, an even bigger biscuit, and collard greens. I can eat a lot but could barely finish the plate after two hushpuppies. Definitely a great portion size for $20 after tax. Taste wasn't as great. The biscuit was a little hard and bland. I guess it's hard to make that large of a biscuit flavorful. The collard greens were good but nothing special. The chicken seemed baked or something - really little oil, the skin was kind of hard, and the meat was a little dry. They do provide a sweet/sour/spicy dipping sauce which helps a little but the meat could still use more flavor. The low oil content might be a good thing for some but when I indulge in fried chicken I want it to be juicy, not dry. My friend got the dumplings with a shrimp/crawfish add-on. The sauce was good, the dumplings were decent, but the serving size was really small. 6-8 smallish dumplings for $20 or so after tax if I remember correctly. I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here but it seems like Brenda's is known for their brunch beignets. I'll try that next time.

One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. I've been back several times and each time I leave full and satisfied. A lot of people are fans of their grits and although I'm not a fan of any grits in general, I do highly recommend it. It's actually one that I would eat because it didn't taste plain and boring like most grits. I always get one of the Benedicts such as the cat fish or the fried chicken. Both the cat fish and fried chicken are lightly fried, yet really crispy and they come out on a fluffy biscuit. I could just sit there and dip the biscuit in gravy all day and I'd be a happy camper! Even with the big portions, when we go in a group we're still greedy heffers where we have to order a beignet flight or pancakes! The crawfish beignets are to die for! Those are the items you have to order if you make a stop in. I've had the omelettes but they didn't stand out like any of the above previously mentioned. Good thing is they're opened pretty much all day so any time is a good time for breakfast!

Beignets on my mind. Plain, apple, chocolate and crawfish-worth the wait Notes:  Be prepared to wait...awhile.  I've gone numerous times to wait anywhere between 15 minutes to 45...no reservations, first come first serve.  Their watermelon tea is fantastic too. Bon appetite.

I use my bookmarks to keep notes on places for future visits or reviews. This is what I wrote after my first visit to Brenda's: Had beignet trio - awesome, favorite, which I wasn't expecting was the crawfish Had the fruit/granola pancakes - big disappointment, pancakes chewy and too much honeydew Potatoes were just ok. Would come back, expanding This trip, I didn't allow a lot of personal time. Usually, I make new restaurants a priority and revisit my favorite "old" places if I have time. I flocked back to Brenda's because I was jonesing hard for those crawfish beignets and made it a priority. The new addition of Brenda's blends seamlessly with the old and doubles their space. I'm not sure if it was the bigger space or that I was there early on a Monday, but I was able to stroll right in. I ordered the beignet sampler - normally comprised of each of their four beignet varieties (plan, apple, chocolate, and crawfish) and a side of potatoes. If you ask, you can customize your sampler and (which I didn't see on the breakfast menu anywhere) order single beignets a la carte. I wish I had known that last point sooner, as I ordered entirely too much food. When my sampler came (two crawfish, two chocolate), I dug into my beignets, but not before texting a few pictures to make a someone back in Chicago jealous. These are not tiny, they are 3" x 3" and stuffed with amazing goodness. I was only able to power through three of them and took the last chocolate one home (they keep really well). I wish I had reviewed my bookmark because I only half-heartedly picked at the potatoes. Where Brenda's loses a star is service. My server was a dud; pleasant when I could actually track her down, but unobservant leaving me languishing for refills. Obviously finished (plate pushed aside, napkin on the table, empty water glass), I gave up trying to flag her down after at least 10 minutes and asked the nearest person for my check. I get to San Francisco about once a year; I can almost guarantee Brenda's will be near the top of my list next year too. Maybe next time I'll shoot for dinner.

I finally got up early enough to try Brenda's!! Beignets are fantastic - get the flight if you want to try them all. My favorite was the apple though our server said most people like the chocolate and crawfish - but the apple gets my love! I ordered the Hangtown Fry and it was delicious. He had the fried catfish benedict - very good as well. Also, the portions are HUGE. I had enough leftovers for lunch, dinner, and another breakfast! Not that I'm all about taking home massive amounts of leftovers, but I like having another meal taken care of and Brenda's took care of like 4 more meals! I also had the grits which are good, but sooo rich. I think it might be mostly butter I'm eating! He had potatoes which I liked a little better. We got here just before 8am, and there was already about 10 people outside waiting! But the space is bigger than I realized inside, and it can fit a lot of people. Servers are nice. Metered parking in the area that is about $3/hour - pricey but not too awful. Do not come here if you are on a diet. But do come if you want to roll out fat and happy!

Crawfish beignet was awesome. Flakey, hot, tasty. Chocolate beignet was ok. Nothing spectacular. I got an oyster po boy and that was great. Having actually been to NO for a week and chowed down on po' boys, it was up there with any I've ever had. Really, really tasty. My date also got oatmeal pancakes with fruit, which were decent but not spectacular. Honestly, even as someone with a pretty big appetite, I think 3-4 beignets would be more than enough food between two people. The hostess was a little crabby and brusque, but not so much that I'd knock them for it. Definitely something I'll be keeping my eye on next time I'm there, though.

We made the mistake of walking to this place but it was well worth it.  Wonderful staff and amazing food.  We tried the plain and chocolate beignets, both were yummy although we preferred the chocolate.  I had granola pancakes that were pretty good but nothing compared to the fried catfish benedict.  What was I thinking, pancakes?  We would eat there again the next time we are in town.

Two words: crawfish beignets. I've never been to the south so I don't know what's authentic Cajun food. However, these crawfish beignets are delightful. I'd order 6 of them snd call it a meal.

A little disappointed... maybe because I don't eat crawfish. Had the 3 other beignets.  Thought they were just ok.... 3 stars. Tired the grillades and grits. I liked the grits and the gravy but the beef seemed just mediocre quality beef. 3 stars. the french toast was decent but a little too sweet. Couldn't do more than a few bites. 3 stars. At least we came early and didn't have to wait at all for a seat. If I had to wait any period of time I would say it is not worth it.

Eyes to big for my tummy.  Greediness takes over.  Leave feeling somewhat disgusted at myself.  Gluttony I hate you! Was it worth it though?  Secretly between you and me... maybe. The three of us ordered the following - 2 gumbo cups - Crawfish Beignets - Shrimp & Grits - Egg & Bacon Tartine - Oyster Po'boy If you ever come with a party of three please learn from our mistake and do not let your gluttonous eyes do such excessive ordering! The food was good but really heavy stuff (think carbs, cheese and deep fry).  As with every other review there is always mention of the Beignets which seems to be their signature dish.  I for one wouldn't waste my time on the other beignet flavours and just head straight for the crawfish. My most favourite thing at this place would be the sweet watermelon tea.  I love how they label it sweet watermelon tea but yet it's definitely not as sweet as a lot of other watermelon teas out there.  Perfectly refreshing and enables you to drink glass after glass after glass after glass (YAY for free refills!!!!)

My first review as a Yelp Elitist! Woot! Woot! Backstory: The only experience i know about soul food is fried chicken and grits. The first time i heard about grits was in the movie "My Cousin Vinny" lol. Since then I've been wanting to try it. I attempted to make it serval time, but have failed. Its either i am not making it correctly or i just don't like the taste. The location of Brenda's is the TL, so i took bart so i did not have to deal with parking. When you walk in you have to put your name on a chalk board which they just cross of your name after calling your name. I went during brunch time last sat. - the wait was roughly 45 mins (average wait time when its slow). The decor is very homey. It has a very southern feeling - even tho ive never been to the south. hehe. The whole restaurant is fairly small, cramming everyone close together. When i was browsing through the menu, everything looked so foreign to me. The only thing that popped to me was friend chicken and grits. Without knowing what i was really ordering i ordered the "shrimp and grits" Plating was gorgeous. Ive never seen soul food so pretty. Grits are covered in melted cheese and garnished with season shrimped. It was amazing! Grits had a rice pudding consistency and was very savory. I recommend it! Another dish that i got to taste was the crawfish beignets. My palette hasn't matured enough to appreciate such a a dish. It was kinda weird for me. I did not hate it nor did it love it. I guess i have to go back and try it again. I loved my experience at Brenda's despite the 45 mins wait. I will def come back to enhance my food exploration of soul food.

YUM! The reviews say it all. Arrived at 1:15pm and waited for 20-30min (as expected). Time flies if you are with good company so I wouldn't worry about the wait. The food is worth the wait. I recommend the Shrimps & Grits - AMAZING! And the Crawfish Beignets. I tried the Beignet Flight but the Crawfish one is by far my favorite so if you like crawfish (ala Boiling Crab flavor) I would recommend highly this.

Brenda's gets my thumbs up! I came for dinner with some friends that live in the area - not the best place to be walking through from Civic Center BART late at night but it should be fine as long as you take the right streets. Anyway - onto the food. We ordered oyster flight, red rice and beans, BBQ pork ribs, and catfish po'boy. All were great although our favorite, by far, was the catfish po'boy. We came on a Friday night around 8pm and were seated within ten minutes, which was pretty lucky because the place is pretty small and pretty popular. I'll definitely be back here but next time from brunch because I've heard that brunch is even better!

The night before having waited two hours to sit at Beretta, I was prepared for a long wait for Sunday brunch. I had done some Yelping and this place stood out by far and I was ready. We were staying at a hotel in the Union Square area, and being total SF newbs said hey let's walk it! WOW walking through the tenderloin district was crazy. I saw some of the most interesting things and I am not going to lie there were a few times I was little scared for my life, and thankful I had not ventured the walk alone. So, forewarning when people say it's in the ghetto - they aren't joking. When we finally arrived after our crazy adventure walk, we put our name on the chalk board and waited, and waited, and waited. After an hour and a half we were finally seated and I was incredibly excited. With that long of a wait and people saying it's the best breakfast they have every had I was ready. I had the creole bloody mary to drink and the pulled pork eggs benedict with a side of grits to eat. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not out of this world good. Perhaps I ordered the boring item? I don't know and while I found it tasty, I guess I felt it just didn't live up to the hype. My bf had ordered the pork belly over grits and felt the same way. I wanted to be in love and have the best breakfast of my life, but unfortunately it just wasn't. So while I would come here again and give it another shot, I am not sure I would do it unless it was a half hour wait. The hour and half wait was purely hype and just not worth it in the end. So it's up to you, good food, but if there is a long wait, don't expect it to be worth they hype.

Delicious. Delicious and there are no other words to describe it. We went on a weekday afternoon and the wait was about 45 mins. Parking as usual in the TL is pretty ridiculous, but the food is to die for. Among the 5 of us, we tried a little bit of everything. We ordered an oyster sandwich which was on of their specials, but we also got a order of the Cornmeal-fried Shrimp po'boy, the Sloppy Josephine, the Grillades & Grits, and the Crawfish Beignets. Everyone was really good, but my favorite was probably the Shrimp po'boy. Also, did I mention that they have watermelon iced tea with refills. I'm usually one fo skimp on drinks and save by just drinking water, but I'm so glad I didn't. Very very pleased. 5 stars and honestly, I'm already planning my next trip back.

Date Day with my Fella. All in all a great place. The beignets were AMAZING. I mean really a delicios flavor. Even the plain one was great. We got the flight of beignets and the favorite by far was the Crawfish one. So unique and such a great flavoring! I could have eaten these all day and been happy. The breakfast was decent, my ham was a little dry though. WARNING: Be prepared for one helluv a wait! In all likely-hood we should have ate a small breakfast and then went to put our names down, I think we waited for almost 2 hours on a Saturday. Craziness. The place is very cramped too. But very much worth it.

Their fried chicken is the best in SF.  Their watermelon iced tea is refreshing and not too sweet.  Their service mimics true southern style and the wait staff remembered me on my 2nd visit.  Their buerre blanc is to die for.  Authentic southern comfort food, and since the expansion I haven't had to wait for a table in almost a year.

SO I have been to Brenda's about 4 or 5 times now.   Brunch B-   I'm not a big fan. I have had the Egg & Bacon Tartine and the Granola Pancakes.  Both were good but not worth the wait.  The Beignet are very good but again not really a whole meal. Dinner B+ I love their fried chicken it is very flavorful and juicy.  The crust has a great crunch and flavor just a little bit of heat.  The chicken is cooked perfectly.  The biscuit isn't the best I've ever had more on the pie crust side needs to be softer like bread.  This biscuit is very dry I always slather it with butter and jam. Ice tea is way too strong you should be able to see through it theirs looks like coffee.  I end up watering it down as I drink it.

Delicious and consistent. The crawfish beignets are filled with a crawfish etoufee filling which is incredible. The pancakes are more like a cake and delicious. Horribly long wait but worth it when the craving strikes. Service is fast and friendly. They get you in an out quickly. Dinner is a much shorter wait. Skip the brunch crowd and go then.

As a first time visitor from Hawaii, and loyal Yelp reviewer, (as in I "yelp" places before going there),I came here on a rainy Saturday morning, expecting a deterred crowd because of the weather. Urrrrrggghhh! Wrong. Busy, busy busy. But not to be dissapointed, I promptly signed my name on the quaint chalkboard "waiting list"; only to be called within a matter of minutes because of my solo status. Score! I would guess the other patrons, as I observed had a 25-30 min wait.... The ambience- high ceilings, open air, ceiling fans lazily spinning about. I guess a small attempt to "recreate" New Orleans flair. The tables are arranged in just a bit odd fashion, as the crowded space is sort of like a labryinth to navigate oneself. Lots of groups, but able to hear oneself, I think. All in all, not too shabby. It makes due with the spacing it has. I for one, sat at the bar section, near the door. Aside from people oogling my food as they waited; it was fine. The service- Friendly, but seemed a bit flustered by the turn around. I observed the host & hostess assisting the servers to help clear tables and whatnot. With that being said, they don't check up on you as much, and are left to give them the "can't you see that I'm ready" look from 35 feet across the room, as another table is being adjusted. Perhaps bus staff is needed, but I surmise with the space issue, it would be the dance of too many people on the floor. The food- Huge portions, did I say HUGE PORTIONS!?The beignets came in an order of 3, I only ate one. They weren't my favorite, but nice to try. Stuffed with different goodies, I had the crawfish which was tasty. However it seemed my outside was a little bit over fried... Idk... Maybe just me. On the contrary, the shrimp and cheese grits were the http://bomb.com (can you say this still!?). A huge steaming bowling of large shrimp, floating in cheesy, saucy goodness. I was full for the rest of the day! Overall, a nice place to try. Steer clear of the seedy streets if you're walking; as it is on the edge of the "friendly" Tenderloin neighborhood. Would definitely eat here again!

I love this restaurant and it was nice to come back after a year.  I hadn't been here since the recent remodel and I really love the new space - more room, much better ambiance, no more long line in the morning (at least when I was there). I had the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, which was awesome!  Tender and tasty pieces of fried chicken on English muffins with eggs and topped with a Creole hollandaise sauce.  This was an extremely flavorful dish and I was very satisfied.  The grits that arrived alongside the entrée was also very good (buttery!).

Quick trip to the Bay area... we were in Pleasanton and just had to do the dash to SF.... I messaged my friend Adena who is my food guru in the bay area and asked for some ideas as to where to go...  She sent me a list.     Oh and if you are planning on dashing into SF for a few hours, my advice is pick your spots carefully--crazy driving around that city... parking can be a B*TCH and if you do go to a good restaurant--1 hour waits are the norm.   We did the Buena Vista Irish Coffee thing first (the BOMB!) and then on Adena's advice headed over to Brenda's.    One  nice thing about Brenda's is that it isn't in the heart of a tourist area and you can actually park out front.... at least you can on a Saturday.   We arrived about 1:15 and the wait was 40 minutes.   So often the host or hostess at a busy place is stressed and short with the customers, this guy was super chill and his great attitude reflected on the people in line... made waiting a whole lot more fun.   But as much fun as it is to wait, that isn't always why we go somewhere.... We are there for the grub.   When a person has high expectations and has really been excited to go to a place... ordering can be difficult.   I got a sandwich with the ham and bechemell sauce... wonderful!   A friend got the grits with shrimp also great.    When I saw what everyone sitting around me ordered it made my mouth water... I will go back.  I have to try the bengetts (I know, I can't spell) and certainly something with Catfish!   Adena, you did good.   Loved the place!   When I go back to the City I will be seeking your advice... and next time I won't be in such a hurry....     Oh and to any SF folks who are reading this...  congratulations on your niners... they seem to be getting the season off to a good start!

This was one of the top spots on my SF bucket list of eateries. Went on the weekend but early enough to avoid a long wait...it was about 30 minutes which is fine for a restaurant that has over 3000 yelp reviews. Here's what we ordered: Beignet Flight---delicious and huge portions. Loved the crawfish and apple! I had the fried catfish egg benedict which was absolutely amazing! Perfection! Hubs had the veggie omelet which disappeared very quickly. The goat cheese really made the dish extra mmm mmm good. But what really took the cake for both of us was the grits. Who would have thought that a girl born in Alabama, raised in South Carolina and currently living in North Carolina would have to go to San Francisco to find perfectly prepared restaurant grits?? Service was great...atmosphere was awesome! Love Brenda's...it definitely lives up to all the hype.

You only need to try Brenda's once to know it's a keeper. Brenda's almost makes SF seem like it's known how to do breakfast all along. * Crawfish Beignet - phenomenal. Baked to perfection, unbelievably good. You're sure to find our you've had Cajun tastebuds all along. * Catfish Benedict - insane. Scientifically-perfect poached eggs, exactly done hollandaise, a perfectly toasted biscuit, and bizarrely non oily catfish. I'd suggest a group between 2-4. Saturday between 12-4 is the best. Get mimosas, they come in jars and are really strong and yummy. Heaven.

This is an update to my previous glowing review. Bottom line: the food is good but the service is horrible. I won't be going back. A family friend is moving away for good. To celebrate, we decided to take him to Brenda's. Big mistake. First offense, our waitress gave us the coldest reception imaginable. I'm not saying you have to bow or something crazy like that but at least pretend youre slightly happy customers are patronizing your establishment. Second offense, she brought our check super early and without our request. We were not even half way done eating when she brought it. Our guest picked up on the vibe instantly saying "who asked her for the check? are they trying to rush us out?" yup, that's exactly what they were doing. The bill was a little over 60 bucks. I placed 80 down since i didnt have change, and continued to eat and converse. She picked it up and said "I'll be back with your change" Honestly at that point I was going to let her keep the change which was well over 20%.  I didn't let her know that though. From that point on I noticed that every waiter that passed gave us a weird look. Obviously wanting us to hurry and leave.  The looks lingered more and more as time went on. I'm annoyed but chose to ignore it. After all it hadn't been a full hour since we were seated. I waited in line outside for longer than that. AND I was spending a decent amount of money. We were treating a guest and I was NOT about to be rushed. Anyways, the "can we box this up for you?" "can we get anything else for you?" visits from the waiter became more and more frequent coupled by the random walkby passive aggressive stares from other employees. Finally, a heavyset, dark haired waitress that we hadn't seen before comes over and removes everything from the table. This was the conversation that followed: Waitress: can we get something else for you? Me: no. We're fine thanks. Waitress: ok. Thanks for visiting us. (pause). BUUUBYE. (then she walked off with the same weird stare as if she wanted to say "now get out") That was the last straw. I called her back and reminded her that our original waitress never brought my change back. She seemed surprised; probably knowing that her attitude just cost her friend a tip. I removed everything from the change tray, placed it in my pocket, and left.   The service used to be great here but I guess in their success they've become arrogant. Maybe they figure their food is so good, they can afford to treat people anyway they choose and theyll keep coming back. Thats their prerogative, but I know at least four people they won't be seeing again.

Definition of "Going Hard": 1 mimosa, 1 cappuccino, 1 apple filled beignet,  1 peach cobbler pancake, and stolen bites from friend's egg & potatoes. If this sounds like I was attempting to cure a hangover, that would be because I was. Best brunch ever. Seriously delicious food here and is one of the best meals I have ever consumed...ever. First of all, the peach cobbler pancakes were so light and fluffy and extra amazing with the chunks of peaches. The beignets were truly deserving of a 10/5 stars. Good cappuccino and good mimosa. It was all phenomenal. I try not to be a regular at any one place because I like to try new establishments, but no question, I will be back here again, and again, and again...you get the idea. When my friend and I decided to do brunch here after a night of hard partying for my birthday, it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. My meal here made me confident this new year and new age will be amazing. Thank you Brenda, you kick some major ass.

The first thing you notice about Brenda's is that there's a long wait on the weekends and it's not located in the most ideal spot - Edge of the 'Loin - so to speak.  But I have to say it's worth the wait or at the very least, the planning it would take to avoid that same wait.  Arriving at opening pretty much takes care of that.  Otherwise, be committed to stand there for awile. The decor is decadent bohemian urban - concrete and baroque-edged mirrors, bench seating with jars on the tables to hold the tableware and the bill, white cloth napkins and experienced servers. The food:  deelish!  Good coffee, crawfish beignets, creamy grits, spicy, if you want it, great bread, great jams, great eggs.  If you like to eat, you'll be happy at Brenda's.  A tad pricey, but worth it and the wait.  Brenda's is one of those restaurants you want to check off your "Gotta Eat Here Before I Die" places.

Ok Brenda's, you won me over with your Catfish Benedict.   I gave Brenda's another chance since my new found love for benedicts.. I'm so glad I did!  The Fried Catfish benedict is FANTASTIC!  Biscuits are amazing, eggs poached perfectly, delicious catfish topped with a yummy sauce. Oh.. and a side of grits, delicious, delicious, grits.. did I say delicious? It was absolutely delicious! Reason why my rating isn't 5 stars is because I also tried the beignets again, and still they were doughy.  Not light like the Cafe du Monde ones in New Orleans.  I'm sure it has something to do with the filling Brenda's puts in their beignets.. probably has to be that dense to hold all that crawfish and apples and what not. I'll skip the beignets next time, but I'll definitely be back for the Catfish Benedict.  Hopefully even try the shrimp po boy next time!

I brought my friends who were visiting from Vegas along with their families, and we all thought that the food was pretty good. We ordered the crawfish beignets which was soft and doughy and just enough flavor to satisfy your beignet cravings. We all got something different so we can try everything out, but my favorite would probably be the shrimp and grits. It was creamy, delicious, and you just keep wanting more. The second favorite for me would be the BFC. It was flavorful and the portions were pretty big. The one thing I didn't like about it would be its greasiness. It left a little puddle of oil on the bottom of the plate. But hey, its southern food and thats what makes it what it is. The biscuit was pretty darn good as well. I would definitely go back and maybe try out their brunch.

Dare I say it? I don't LOVE it here, like everyone else. What I did love, though: Crawfish beignets. So delicious and flavorful. You may want to split this dish with someone else, since I would imagine that having 3 of these would be a little overwhelming.. but it was soft, delicious. So delicious. Biscuits. The biscuits that came on the side of my omelette. To die for. The perfect crisp and soft texture. What I didn't love: The oyster and bacon omelette that I had and the grits that I had last time. Definitely not a favorite yet, it seems like they win me over with the small details and extra side fixins, but I will definitely continue to come back, just so that I can deconstruct the entree menu a little more. You don't have a fan yet... but you may soon!

And who would think to use this dish on Eggs Benedict?! Crazy Genius! And a Must have for dessert?! Chocolate Beignets. I'm a health-nut but given the reviews I read prior to my visit, I had to have it. And I inhaled it. I give Brenda's a High - 5 because everything else is great in this place. (Well, apart from the long wait. But trust me.. It's well worth it) From the staff, to the service & the ah-amazingly super yummy food, I'd definitely come back again.. And..

Food comaaaaaa! As a native of New Orleans, I was so excited to try Brenda's. What did I learn from this trip to Brenda's? My tolerance for soooooul (imagine how people say SOUL train) food has plummeted. Though the fried catfish eggs benedict and gargantuan crawfish beignets were soooul good, I suffered the most intense food coma as a result of eating these. After four hours of nap-time on vacation, I decided that Brenda's was just a one-time destination for me. Tip: Don't eat all of the crawfish beignets in one sitting; take some home! They'll taste even better then. :)

Seemingly after late nights, Brenda's French Soul Food has been the spot perfectly to grab some food before friends have to hit up BART for their ride back home. With the new remodeled building raising seating capacity, the wait time has not been as long as I once remembered. Recent outings had me consume some delicious heavy food putting me back to sleep afterwards. Beignet Flight - The variety pack of beignets at Brenda's is winning the jackpot for those who have a tough time deciding which flavors they want to try. Plain and Apple were delicious and reminded me of donuts with its' doughy texture and powdered sugar. I was not a fan of the chocolate, because it hardens as the meal progressed and became gooey in the microwave as leftovers. Crawfish is savory and creamy adding the chunks of crawfish makes for an amazing dish all on its own. This can satisfy one person, so eat sparingly and take the rest home because this is only the first course! Shrimps and Grits - Buttery grits (only way to eat them) smothered in cheese and shrimp. It lacks in certain flavors and the tails left on the shrimp is a big turn off for this lazy eater. I did find myself dumping hot sauce to extract some heat from this rich creamy dish, but I wasn't a huge fan of this dish overall. Croque Monsieur - In layman's term, a grilled ham and cheese with more CHEESE! So have you figured out I love cheese? Almost Urkel status I'm afraid, but it's also a dish I've grown to love spending some time in Paris, France. The nicely crisp bread paired with cheese and ham and I must say again more cheese is delicious, and I had to pair it with some of their jam provided on the table to make for a sweet bite. Watermelon Ice Tea was yummy with hints of watermelon on a nice light ice tea flavor. Jugs of these are seen on the counter, but I wish it was more chilled on a hot day. With amazing food, I always plan to come back early to beat the rush. However there is a dinner menu that peaks my interest if I can find some willing bodies to roam the area at night with. Parking can be difficult so bring quarters for those meters and hoof it over so you can hoof it back and burn those much added calories you just ingested.

Finally got to try this place on my birthday for brunch. My friend Jeremy has been raving about this place FOREVER!!! The portions are huge. The grits and biscuits are to die for. The coffee,  just right. The beignets are ginormous. I had the flight of four. Didn't realize the size of them bad boys. The special of the day was banana filled with chocolate chips and whipped cream. We also got the crawfish, apple and chocolate. All of them were well worth the trip here. I can't wait to come here again for somma that good soul food.

Had the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict with grits this morning.  It was was dizzyingly delicious.  The pulled pork was steeped in que sauce that had just the right amount of smoke but also a lovely vinegary finish.   The biscuits were crumbly yet soaked up the porky que sauce like a brawny towel gone cajun. Grits were still too runny for my taste.

This place is always crazy busy.  You want to have a relaxing weekend breakfast?  Nope sorry, not here.  The wait is usually an hour, give or take.  But, the food is bomb, so sometimes waiting that long is worth it. Here are some of my favorites: 1) Crawfish Beignets-  delicious!!!  Generous portions with crawfish and cheddar cheese.  Mmmmm...One of these will already fill you up, but you won't wanna stop there.... 2) Hangtown Fry- my go to meal if I'm in a hurry.  Breaded and fried oysters and bacon scrambled with egg, grit or hash, with toast or biscuit. (Get the biscuit, you can have your boring toast at home). 3) Pork Belly and Cheesy Grits with a Poached Egg.  (Prelude to a Heart Attack is what this should be called).  This is on their special board.  So good, but a little greasy from all the cheese. 4) Watermelon Sweet Tea-  wash all the fatty goodness down with this wonderful concoction.  Very refreshing AND free refills.  Yay!! You can't really go wrong with whatever you order here.  You will most likely enjoy it.  The servers are nice and efficient as well.  Now if only I could skip the long lines.....life would be perfect.  :)

Some bum on the streets of SF is telling all of the other bums about the amazing brunch he had yesterday. Yes, we went to Brenda's and gave away half of our meals because the portions were so big and the flavors were insanely rich. We tried to get there as early as possible but even at 9:30, there was a 30 minute wait for a table for 2.  Luckily, I had 2,000 photos on Yelp to browse through during the wait.  When we were finally seated, I was so excited to eat.  We started with one (yes, you can order one) crayfish beignet. I liked the flavor a lot and I did expect the pastry to be a bit lighter than it was. The bf and I both ordered off the specials board but I'm certain that my Special was more Special than his.  I had the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and the pulled pork was exploding with flavors. They were placed onto two large biscuits.  I could only eat one before I was stuffed.  The hash that accompanied the eggs benedict was average. The bf got the Crispy Pork Belly Grits. I'm not a fan of grits in general and the extra cheese made the dish over-the-top rich. The pork was good though and it also came with a perfectly cooked egg.

This place gets so much Yelp love that it's hard not to be on the 5-star train for Brenda's. I'm in Orange County, and no less than 14 Yelp friends have already reviewed and raved about this place.  Still, I'm a fan. My intention had been to get the eggs benedict with fried chicken for brunch, but we were there on a Monday and it's only available during the weekend. Faced with making a split second-choice decision, and a little dismayed that none of their other signature items appealed to me (crawfish beignets sound gross to someone who doesn't eat seafood) I ended up with the most common of breakfast items -- a ham & cheese egg white omelette. Came with grits and a biscuit. Already not excited by the lack of actual French soul food on my plate, I was at least happy that all of the items were still executed really well and tasted wonderful. The cheesy grits were mostly creamy, which I love that way, and the biscuit was a tiny exploded ball of heaven that was incredibly fresh and buttery. Every rose, it turns out, has its thorn, and Brenda's failed the hour-later test on my digestive system. I went directly from there to SFO for an hour flight and it was one of the most uncomfortable flights I've ever been on. Ah well...whatever didn't agree with me at least tasted great.

On craving fried chicken I made a visit to Brendas. I had the fried chicken dinner that comes with a biscuit and collard greens with a side of mac and cheese. The fried chicken has a super crunchy skin and comes with a great dipping sauce that reminds me of sauce for jalapeno poppers. The biscuit is crumbly on the outside and fluffy heaven on the inside. Solid mac and cheese with crusty cheese on top. There were other items on the menu that sounded great--grits and such. Unfortunately the next time I'm at Brenda's I probably won't be able to keep my mitts off the fried chicken!

Came here to try the Crawfish Beignet that was featured on the 7x7 Big Eat. http://www.7x7.com/big-e… We ended up ordering the Beignet Flight (Plain, Chocolate, Granny Apple Smith, and Crawfish) because we wanted to taste them all. Honestly, the best one is probably the plain one. In person and in pictures, the beignets look scrumptious. Take a bite though and you will be disappointed. There was a mountain of powdered sugar/seasoning on top of each of them. The chocolate was sweet but not overly sweet - this was the one my boyfriend liked the best. The apple one tastes like an apple pie - not bad. The crawfish one, which is the one I came here for, did not impress. The crawfish flavor did not come through at all, and it was too creamy and rich. Sigh. Another let down by the 7x7 Big Eat. Although, the Watermelon Iced Tea was really yummy! It is exactly what it sounds like. It's not too sweet and very refreshing.

Quick thoughts: - Decor with mirrors looks great. - Chalkboard sign-in sheet is charmingly SF - Fried chicken dish was underwhelming. -The crawfish beignets were heavenly. To this day, I think about those crawfish beignets. I really should just buy a dozen to go, but that wouldn't even last me the day.

So many pilgrimage-worthy restaurants for every budget in San Francisco, from famous street vendors and food trucks to Michelin-rated upscale eateries. In the heart of San Francisco's Tenderloin District, where you will see a perpetual line, is the well-known budget-minded French-Creole hybrid called Brenda's. Our wait period for Sunday brunch was an hour and a half. To break up the wait, many of the regulars made their way over to Philz Coffeehouse one street over on Van Ness. Duly noted for my next visit. Brenda's hearty and colorful fare draws folks from all around the city and from afar. The menu features both French and Creole classics (Shrimp & Grits, Catfish Po' Boy, Catfish Eggs Benedict, Croque Monsieur, Hush Puppies, Fried Green Tomatoes, Red Beans & Rice, BBQ Pork Ribs, Smoked Pork Rilettes, Onion Soup), along with some inventive signature items  like their signature Beignets and Sweet Watermelon Tea. Dishes reflect chef/owner Brenda Buenviaje's extensive New Orleans and French culinary training. We got one of the Beignet Flights ($9.50), which features a sampling of each variety - plain, Ghiradelli chocolate, green apple with honey butter and the savory crawfish. These fried dough pockets filled with warm mouth-watering centers are sure to please. The cayenne-dusted Crawfish Beignets were the crowd favorite (I got an order to bring home too). My friend got the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict ($12.95) and I had the Chicken, Andouille Sausage and Okra Gumbo ($7.50 a bowl). Both were excellent and very good sized, but the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict was incredibly delicious and worth a special trip. Perfectly cooked poached eggs with a citrus-infused hollandaise sauce on warm house made cream biscuits. I'm already getting ready for my next visit - heading up to SF for labor day weekend and looking forward to stopping by Brenda's again. Carve out some time and experience one tender (loin) bender. Brenda's will not disappoint.

Soul food is usually not my cup of tea but Brenda has certainly changed that. I was here with a big group of people at 11:15 on a Friday. The wait was little less than 15 minutes. so not bad at all. We ordered the crawfish beignets to share. They were so good and I thought I should I have just order that as an entree with a side of fried chicken. I ordered a pork belly grits special with a side of biscuit as my lunch entree. It was very good as well and came with large portion. I am 6 months pregnant, and even I thought it was very fulfilling. The pork belly was tender and melt in my mouth. Pairing the grits with the biscuit was just heavenly.   I highly recommend the crawfish beignets if you are coming here on a weekday for lunch. I heard they have a bigger menu on Saturday, so they might have other kinds of beignet to order. Strongly suggest coming here early before 11:30 on a regular day.

A return visit to Brenda's reaffirms all the dreams I've had of my last meal here several years ago. Since then, they've moved to larger and nicer digs on Polk St but the amazing food (and the long lines) have followed suit. It was an impromptu decision to come here for Sat brunch. We thought we'd beaten the rush by getting there at 9am but it was still a 25 min wait (the lines moved quickly due to high turnover rate). The beignet flight was as good as I remember, especially the savory and spicy crawfish version. The granny smith apple version was good as well but I still preferred the crawfish one. Saved the chocolate and plain sugar ones to go... ..because I had to save room for the amazing shrimp and grits!  I think this is still one of the best versions I've had anywhere (including in Charleston, Savannah, or New Orleans). The cheesy and creamy grits are punctuated with plentiful shrimp and also has a nice spicy kick from the chili oil. The special, the pulled pork eggs Benedict on cornbread was good as well but I loved the shrimp 'n grits the most. Lines get progressively worse the later the morning but it's so worth it!

This place is amazing. I had extremely high expectations coming in thanks to the yelp reviews I read and what a friend of mine said about the place and it did not disappoint. The crawfish beignets were perfect. I also had a bowl of the gumbo which was very tasty. I only wish I could've ordered more food, this place was probably my favorite meal on my week long vacation in SF.

I've been here three times now. If you want good service, fast turn around in your order and timely coffee refills then I implore you not to show up on the weekends during their mid-morning  to lunch time frame. The B & T crowd is in full swing during this time and your service experience will be crappie. Trust me go during the week either for breakfast or evening for dinner.  The only time to go on the weekend is at 7:15 before they open at 8 am.  This place is definitely worth the wait for an amazing NOLA inspired menu. I love the shrimp n grits that tastes so awesome, very filling, and a good price. Their  French Toast with butter pecan sauce is so yummy! Defiantly not diet food! Even though its in the edge of the tenderloin its not to low brow for most of the folks in SF. I'm also in love with the crawfish beignets. Filled with crawfish, spices and cheese in a lighly baked bun...mmmmm so good with a cup of NOLA coffee.

Are you kidding me?!?  I haven't reviewed Brenda's yet.  Wow!  Shame on me. In my search for New Orleans / Southern food in SF, this is the winner.  Wooowoo!   From carrying my favorite beer (Abita Strawberry) when it's in season to serving up the most delicious po-boys in the city, I LOVE this place. Foods I've tried: Catfish Po boy (excellent.  try it) Shrimp Po Boy (excellent.  try it) If you are with a friend, then get one of each and do halfsies. Fried Chicken Shrimp and grits (sooo indulgent.  wow. excellent.  try it) Grits and Grillards (pretty good.  you could try it) Catfish benedict (SUPER yum again.  wow. excellent.  try it) Pork belly and grits (indulgent.  wow. excellent.  try it. BUT not quite as loved as the shrimp version) Beignets flight (good / ok)  These are not quite the authentic texture I'm looking for in beignets, but besides that the flavors are pretty good.  My favorite is the crawfish savory one.  I suggest you try them.  Keep in mind I am comparing these to the other dishes that I obsess over here, so it's kind of a weird situation when you are comparing to fantastic. Biscuits (BEST in the city) Gumbo (Yummy) Red Beans (Yummy) I think my lesson here is that you should try it all.  My favorites for brunch are the catfish benedict and the shrimp & grits.  Lunch favorites are the catfish or shrimp po boys. I'm not really a fan of the watermelon iced tea because I don't like stuff in my drinks and I don't like watermelon really.  Who cares though??  I'll order tea or something else.  The foods is my favorite. Lastly, as others say, you are going to deal with a wait for a table. On the weekends, get there before 10 and on the weekdays for lunch get there around 11:30 or earlier. Brenda's is definitely the fat of me.  Thank you!  Loving every minute of it.

I do like coming to this place on a normal weekday for brunch. Good food, great service, a bit too hyped and way too busy during weekend brunch. If it wasn't for the beignet assortment I will not have come back. Tip 1: If you are ordering beignets they usually serve it as an appetizer. If you are not used to eating sweets to start a meal like me, ask them to serve it to you at the end of the meal.

I die for these shrimp and grits. so flavorful. it seriously goes boom!boom!pow! in your mouth. I swear I rolled my eyes up in ecstasy. crawfish beignets were good, but mine weren't as gooey as some of the pictures I've seen.. was it me, Brenda?? why, baby, why? guess I'll just have to come back to try it again. &this time, I ain't sharing. &I must remember to try the watermelon iced tea. can't believe it slipped my mind last time. what kind of foodie am I?! as down home as you can get for being in a big city. I LOVED the chalkboard that you write your name on. &the servers were nothing but smiles for the fresh early morning. can't wait to come back for dinner!

On an early Sunday morning, my friend and I venture to get some yummy brunch and reminisce about our late night out the evening prior.  I don't brunch in SF often so she took me here and it was such a treat!  The beignets are absolutely delicious.  My favorite was the crawfish one and the original one.  We also tried the gumbo, shrimp and grits and eggs benedict florentine.  Eggs benedict is nothing special but man the grits are just as good as from down South (I lived in S. Carolina for a year).  The tomato relish on the shrimp and grits is absolutely divine.  Loved it!

LUCKY! I've been told by many that this place usually has a line out the door, but I guess everyone was watching Game 1 of the 2012 World Series! We walked in and saw the sign to "write our name on the chalk board door" and "you will not be seated until your entire party arrives" The BF and I arrived a little bit before our double date friends so we sat in the tiny owl cove next to the door. The two gals working were nice and offered us drinks while we waited and checked in on us while we waited. As soon as our friends arrived we got our table. Drinks: Watermelon Iced tea, what a great idea! Very refreshing, but could have been more ice and a little more bitter... I'm a fan of unsweetened iced tea and this one was a little bit on the sweet side. To start, we tried the Craw fish Beignet which we found very flavorful. We ordered 2 which we split 4 ways. For our main course, we ordered the same thing (not on purpose, but it was just what we ended up wanting) BF: Ribs with Collared Greens and Mac N Cheese (same as the girl on the double date) Myself: BFC (same as the dude on the double date) Side order of Grits for the table I have to say, the chicken was cooked very well. Spice already incorporated in the batter and there was a nice dipping sauce that came with the chicken. I enjoyed the cream bread which melted in my mouth and it didn't say on the menu, but the meal came with collared greens! YUM The ribs were nice, sweet, yet tangy. They had a good portion and the Mac N Cheese was the best I've tasted thus far. Don't get me wrong, they didn't make me swoon or anything, but it had a great flavor and texture. The Grits were so buttery and I love butter so no complaints! Would I return? Yes!! We actually all take turns picking the place and everyone was so happy with our dinner that we're opting to let my BF choose the locations now b/c he hit a home run with Brenda's! Why only 4 stars? Well, although the girls did greet us initially, while we were seated, one of the girls was very short and kinda gave attitude. When we were ordering our appetizers and drinks, I asked everyone at the table if they were ready to order main dishes (which they were) and she interrupted me and said "There is no rush, I'll come back after I put in the order of Beignet" and walked away. When my friend inquired between the Sweet Potato Dumplings and the BFC, she looked at him condescendingly and referred him to the chicken. I asked for a box while she was refilling my drink and she looked at me and said as if i implied RIGHT NOW "You're going to have to give me a second" Perhaps she was grumpy that she was missing the game, but GEEZ.

I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. As with much of SF, all the good places are tucked away where you wouldn't expect it. Hidden in the tenderloin, this place is truly a gem. I've come here for brunch a few times and it' was delicious each time. FOOD - Beignets: recommend their cajun beignets over their flight of beignets. The cajun beignet is something you can't really get anywhere else but the other 3 are just must mediocre at best. Their cajun one is AMAZING though. - Shrimp and grits: soo good! I don't typically find grits all that appetizing, but when these came out, they were covered in this oozy cheesy goodness that I just can't describe. I recommend getting a dish with potatoes and dipping the potatoes in with the grits. It sounds like a weird combo, but trust me, you won't regret it. - Catfish: This wasn't the most memorable dish, but the potatoes it came with were amazing. - Watermelon iced tea: soooo good! It's very refreshing and it perfectly balances out the heaviness of the rest of the meal. - The venue is very cutely decorated and it has a quiant French Louisiana type atmosphere. You feel like you can escape a bit from the hustle bustle of city life. Bottom line, I highly recommend this spot despite the long waits. You will DEFINITELY leave with a food coma and your taste buds will thank you for it.

Long lines don't lie. We got here on a Saturday around brunch time. The inside was packed and there were about 20 parties chalked up before us (since you write your name on the chalk board). Fortunately, it was for a table of 3 and so the wait would be relatively quickly. Though they said about 45 min, it only took 20 min. Talking to my friend, since they expanded the restaurant, the wait goes by a lot faster than before. Service (4/5): Our waiter was attentive with refills and such. The only knack here is that we had ordered beignet flight as appetizers; however, we saw that other tables after us were receiving their flights. We asked the waiter to check again, and there must have been a mix up. We received the beignets a minute before getting our actual food. Of course we we were concentrating on the main course than the flight. The beignets don't taste good if they aren't fresh. Food (4/5): The crawfish beignet was GOOD. I suggest getting the this and/or the flight so you can try the other types of beignets. The chocolate is very rich and you'll be in for a treat if you're a chocolate lover. I forgot the name of the dish, but it was basically pork belly, with some kind of cheese over grits. I've never really tried grits before but it worked well with the cheese. The pork belly was really flavorful and tender. I would defintely try this again.

I am a huge brunch fan. I had heard good things about this place and hence went. It's good but I've had better. The wait was also a bit long. But on a more positive note, the customer service was great! Would go back if a friend asked to meet there but wouldn't seek it out on my own.

Tried Brenda's on a Saturday afternoon recently. The brunch menu was still being served so our group tried the flight of biegnets as a starter. They were good and filling even though five of us shared the order of four. I enjoyed the chocolate, the apple and the savory seafood one. Not fantastic, but decent. Maybe a bit too much dough for my taste. Still, I enjoyed the crispy texture. The chocolate provided the best overall consistency because of its liquidity. The apple was flavorful, tart and spiced nicely. The crayfish one could have been best, but I think the powder (cayenne?) on top was overdone and the dough was too thick compared with the sparse filling. For my main course I had the eggs benedict with catfish. Its very good, although I didn't need the doughy biscuit. A few bites of the biscuit were enough to accompany the yummy fried catfish and poached egg.  The fried potatoes on the side were fairly good too. Others in my group had the shrimp and grits, french toast and the pancakes. These were OK but I felt that the large bowl of grits was more than enough. Maybe this is better as a side dish. I think they should try to stuff the french toast with cream cheese or jam (or both!) to make it more unique. The menu is definitely interesting and the watermelon iced tea was refreshing. I would definitely go back and try some other things on the menu.  The one-hour wait for a table was the only downer.

I went here during a business trip looking for a great brunch.  I opted for Brenda's because of the high number of reviews and everyone was pleased with the menu options.  I guess the patrons have not experienced much in the way of soul food for the culinary delight of their palate or my French toast was just dry.  There was even a line outside so I thought for sure I was in for a treat....not so much. Guess I have learned my lesson....the staff was nice.  But I won't be going here again.

Yes you will wait to eat here on a weekend morning. But I will tell you that it is most definitely worth the wait! Every time I have been to Brenda's I have left happy, full, and excited about the next time I will be coming back. Good advice from other Yelpers... go to Philz and get a delicious coffee while you wait. Share everything the portions are HUGE and the more you share the more you get to try. Like: The beignet flight (crawfish- by far my favorite, apple, chocolate, plain) Shrimp and Grits Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict -GET THIS! The seasoning is absolutely incredible. Pork Belly with cheese grits - this was a daily special Catfish Bloody Mary Watermelon Iced tea I have yet to try something here that I didn't like. And the service is also top notch - everyone is so friendly and helpful.

This is an update.  I took my bf here on Labour Day for some comfort food while we visit the city.  The standard waiting time is 1.5 hours.  With over 3000 reviews and over 1000 photos I don't think I would complain lol...  I did give my bf heads up on the wait in advance so we took a stroll around the Plaza the wait was somewhat a bliss.  The good part is they don't rush you out of the door once you comsumed the meal and sitting there in a food coma....  well, I am sure there's a grace period before they'll kick you out but once you see the check on the table you will just happily pay for the fantastic experience and let those people out there waiting to have a chance to enjoy some hot and yummy food.  We are all nice people, aren't we? I love the Crayfish Beignet and even my skeptical bf who avoid crayfish was happily wolfing it down.  I ordered Shrimps and Grits, my favourite and he ordered BFC.  He said the fried chicken was juicy and nice while he kept eyeing my dish so I fed him some yummy grits with tomato and bacon bits and then some shrimps. He even went hmmm with each mouth full... lol...  It's a very rich and cheesy dish but it taste so good!  We also like the water melon iced tea.  Will sure to come back when we visit the city again.  Hmmmmmm.....

If you order the burger with goat cheese, you get a massive wad (about safeway $3 worth) on there.  The burger is cooked perfectly and the fries are very good, too.  Nice beer selection, including Ibita.  Since they've expanded their space, the uncomfortable squeezed waiting space is no longer so bad.  On several weekday visits lately, we've never had to wait more than 5 min. Maybe I'm a bit spoiled from eating Po' Boys in NOLA but IMO, their shrimp po' boy isn't so fantastic.  It's pretty dry and the shrimp are not big enough. Great place!  Will come again many times for that wicked tasty burger.

To get the maximum deliciousness out of your Brenda's experience, I recommend the following steps: 1. Get here at around 9-9:30AM at the latest. C'mon, that's really not that early if you think about it. Put your name on the chalkboard inside. 2. Mosey over to Philz coffee on Van Ness and Turk for a delicious cup of the Philz Harmonic. 3. Brenda's has gotten much faster at turning around tables, so by the time you get back, you're likely to be 1st or 2nd on the list. 4. Be seated, get the Watermelon Iced Tea. 5. Then order a flight of beignets, catfish eggs benedict, and another dish, and share amongst your party (you're going to want to try everything). 6. Go home $15 poorer but stuffed and happy!

7x7: Crawfish beignets at Brenda's French Soul Food Overrated. Waited about an hour to get in here, go the beignets & sweet potato pancakes. Good to go once, to say I've been and tried, and have to disagree with your thinking that these beignets are god-sent. It just tastes like a seafood croquet you get at some restaurant you stop by with friends somewhere out of town cus youre so hungry and thats the only thing around, and one of em goes out on a limb and says we should order the seafood croquet, even though the town is nowhere near the ocean/water, but you just order it, and never really think  about it until you write a review about something that tastes similar, and similarly not memorable.

Can't go back to SoCal without having a full Sunday brunch at Brenda's! The wait here is terrible (at least 1-2 hours), but we do it anyway every time we are in the area. We always order beignets even though they fill us up before our entrees arrive.  There are three per order and we usually split them up.  We've had all of them:  the plain is good, and well, traditional.  The chocolate has a large amount of Ghirardelli chocolate in it.  The apple one tastes like a McDonald's apple pie.  Crawfish is interesting and savory.  If you can't decide which to get you can always sample them all withe the "Beignet Flight" (your choice of 4).  ...Kinda weird, though, the last time we ordered 3 apples, but got 2 chocolates with 1 apple (surprise?!). A big favorite to get for the pork-lovers is the pork belly dish.  They're almost always out of these when we are here though...   Another favorite is the shrimp & grits (sautéed shrimp, cheddar grits, spicy tomato-bacon gravy).  It's a bit heavy to have before a long drive, but there's something irresistible about the cheesy grits smothered with salty gravy...  (mouth watering now). I made the mistake of wanting to try something new and ordered the grillades & grits (beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy, served with grits, 2 eggs any style, plus cream biscuit or toast).  The cutlets were a bit dried out and chewy.  The gravy sauce made the whole dish taste similar to Taco Bell taco meat.  I had expected a beefy version of the shrimp & grits -- no dice. Of course, you can't go wrong with classic oldies, but goodies like the eggs benedict, french toast (it's a lotta toast for 1 person!), or the homemade granola pancakes with fruit (HUUUUGE!). Lastly, you must not leave without trying their sweet watermelon house tea (which just tastes like fresh watermelon juice).  It's $2.75, but with unlimited refills! It's usually hustling and bustling here for Sunday Brunch; I've never seen it not busy.  The food's spectacular.  The service is hit-or-miss (usually the servers here are too busy to smile or give you time to complete your sentence before they hurry off again).

I gave this place two tries, but neither times impressed me. My first visit, I had the gumbo. It was a small bowl with probably 2 tablespoons of rice. The rice seemed more like a garnish than an integral part of the dish. I expected a bold flavor from the gumbo. It was a bit bland instead. At the end of the meal, I was still quite hungry--not what you'd expect from soul food. I didn't bother ordering anymore, because I'd have to wait again. On my second visit, I ordered the Hangtown Fry, which had grits, fried oyster scramble, and a biscuit. I was satisfied this time, but not so much by the quality. Overall, the dish was just ok. The biscuit was great, but the grits tasted the way it would taste if I had cooked it (nothing special). I was a bit deceived by the menu description and expected scrambled eggs AND whole fried oysters, not fried oysters chopped up into tiny bits and scrambled with the eggs. And there was nothing spectacular about the scrambled eggs either. Your typical diner quality scrambled eggs. The crawfish beignets were ok. Not enough crawfish. Beignets were kind of hard. Then they sprinkled too much paprika on top.

Stopped by for a late lunch on a weekday, so there was no wait at all.  Location is easy to get to, just a short walk away from Civic Center BART stop.   Service was okay, nice and efficient.  The tables & silverware were a little dirty, to the point where it was somewhat unappetizing, though I can still deal with it.  Prices were decent.  The dishes come in huge portions, so it's significantly cheaper if you share. We ordered the crawfish beignets and BFC (biscuit, fries, and fried chicken).  Sooooo much food; I definitely recommend sharing.  The crawfish beignets were pretty good, though a little heavy on the cayenne pepper so the outer shell tasted a bit powdery & dry.  I would still re-order this dish though, as the filling is really tasty and it's a pretty unique dish.  I enjoyed the BFC, though it didn't necessarily stand out over other southern fried chicken places I have tried.  I would still recommend the BFC plate, but it's not something that I feel compelled to get every time I return.  I will probably try more of their breakfast dishes next time and the shrimp & grits. I also had the sweet watermelon iced tea, which was okay, though I want to note it was very pulpy.  They also serve alcohol here. Overall, I like the style of food at Brenda's and they do a pretty good job executing their menu.  I would definitely return if I'm in the mood for a heavy brunch.

It's very easy to make a moderately good breakfast, you just need good ingredients, classic recipes, and to be consistant in your delivery. However, it's really hard to make a breakfast that stands out, which is something Brenda's has accomplished. The good: The cheesy filling of the crawfish beignets The grits The butter pecan syrup that accompanies the french toast The apple filling The flaky, buttery biscuits The "nothing to write home about": The beignets weren't as light as I wanted them to be The french toast I had the goat cheese and shrimp omelette with egg whites. I was impressed by how well the goat cheese went with the eggs. There was nothing bad. I was impressed. I would love to return

Cajun food is horribly underrepresented in California, so I am always excited to find a Cajun restaurant, but the food here is genuinely done right.  It isn't all generic Cajun recipes, but all of the dishes are cooked and seasoned to be perfectly and unmistakably high-quality soul food. I've been here three times, and each time I was blown away by how good the food is.  The poboys are one of the most wonderful tasting things I have ever had on the west coast.  Even the cold day-old leftovers taste better than the hot fresh food at your average restaurant (which is why I'm writing this review the day after going there).  I very infrequently eat meat, but I'll always make an exception for an oyster poboy from here.  Prices are very reasonable, too.   BTW, person who was waiting outside to be seated, this is not "The cheapest French restaurant in town."  It is soul food.  Cajun food.  A lot of Cajun food is localized French food, but this is not a "cheap French Restaurant".

While looking for parking, we passed it. They should have a bigger sign. Just sayin'. We were the 2nd group to get seated for the day. We started off with the beignet flight. I'm glad I ate it in order: regular, apple, chocolate, crawfish. My tastebuds started at happy when I began at regular beignet and increased in magnitude after going through the flight. I could definitely have to crawfish beignet for lunch and be content. I got the Hangtown Fry with grits and cream biscuit. The oysters were seasoned just enough to stand out from the dish. I've never had that type of grits before. I think they were made from scratch. It had the consistency of porridge. The biscuit cuts like butter and I think half a cup went into mine. If I want to have an excellent, hearty and filling breakfast, I'll go here.

Go here at odd hours, or expect to write your name down their full sized chalk board of a wait list and wait for a (hot) minute.  Get the watermelon tea, get the gumbo.  Ask for the fried chicken with collard greens and biscuits.  Ask for the Fried Oyster scramble with grits. Don't ask how many sticks of butter in the grits.  Don't ask how much whole milk they put in the grits, either.  Don't forget the crawdad beignet.  Don't eat here more than once a week to prevent obesity.  Eat here at least once a week to promote happiness. Just sayin.   Cot Damn, this place is good.

Don't be fooled by the word "beignets," these suckers are FILLING! I came here for breakfast & got the crawfish beignets, because, well, that seemed to be the most popular thing! & to my pleasant surprise, I was presented with a sugary, sweet doughnut like bread, filled with cheese and a plentiful amount of crawfish. There's nothing else like it here! We came pretty early in the morning, probably before 8 am, and beat the crowd! I would love to come back sometime to see what other flavorful dishes they have in store.

My hubby and I got dinner here recently and I just have to say again that their fried chicken is great. It came with collard greens that were perfectly cooked (not too mushy) and with some ham/bacon that made it really tasty...I'm usually not a huge fan of collard greens. The biscuits are SO good and it came with this red pepper jelly that was slightly sweet slightly spicy and so addictive. My hubby got really meaty ribs with a bbq sauce that you can tell they made themselves, and his mac and cheese was so cheesy and gooey. Happy tummies for sure.

Another lazy Sunday, a girlfriend and I, intoxicated and hungry, went to Brenda's and ate too much. Can you believe there was no line? That by itself made me so excited. The staff here must love their restaurant a lot. When we walked in the door, all three staff on the floor looked up to us. One came immediately to sit us and they all smiled. During the whole meal, every time customers would come in, the staff would look up at acknowledgement, someone would walk right towards them and offer to seat them, while the other two were looking at how many ppl were in the party. (as to gauge how much business it would bring for that evening- a very good thing) they were all so happy. I love that chalkboard by the way. We started with the crawfish beignets that I was craving. Always on point. Chunks of crawfish and the cayenne pepper with cheddar and scallions oozing out. Then there was the gumbo. The okra was absolutely delicious inside of it. That was the best part. You could taste it all throughout the gumbo. Washed it down with their watermelon tea. The waitress even came back for refills without us even asking. The BFC - the fried chicken plate - was again over the top. How do they get it so golden and crispy? The biscuits were insane. The grits were buttery and savory. and the collared greens made me feel like I was in the south. The whole plate did. I said to my girlfriend, "pick something else light" and mistakenly we chose the The Hangtown Fry. We couldn't help it. The crispy oysters inside were numerous and I was so full after. It took effect right away. Did I mention their house jam is always good too? 5 stars for their service and their food. Always a great eat at Brenda's. We ate so much and couldn't stop, with to go boxes even at the end, it's the day before, and I'm still feeling full and stuffed thanks to Brendas.

Brenda.. How did you know?  Pulled pork eggs Benedict!?!  Did you just use "pulled pork" and "Benedict" in the same recipe?  Bananas Foster French Toast?  Wow.. now this is just getting weird.  Are you stalking me, Brenda?  Had you been playing some Allen Toussaint on the PA, I could have died a happy man right there in your restaurant.  That's correct, your deliciousness threatened my life. Also, Watermelon Ice Tea.  And the Crawfish Beignet is obviously a must.  Because what the fuck is crawfish doing in a beignet?  Is it a breakfast pastry? a dessert? a savory saucy snack?  You decide. Look no further my friends.  Brenda's French Soul Food will smooth your soul and clog your spirit arteries like no other cuisine in the City.  Arrive early, chalk your name in, be polite.  Enjoy!

food: 5/5 would have given a 4 if it weren't for large portion sizes service: 3/5 decor/cleanliness: 5/5 Would definitely come here again. Brenda's French Soul Food is a popular brunch place. I went on the weekend when they have breakfast all day as well as a dinner menu at 5. The beignet's, both savory and desert, are great. They are really the highlight of this place. Be sure to try them if you go, they serve 3 on a plate or you can buy a single one. If you can't decide, there is also a beignet platter that has one of each flavour (total 4), except for the special beignet of the day. The portions at brenda's are fairly large. Two people can share a dish if they are not super hungry and still be full. It is even possible to do family style for certain dishes. Each dish is around $15 each. I'm not much of a egg breakfast food person, so I didn't particularly enjoy the egg-y portion of my meal. However, their meats are great and tasty. The biscuits are fluffy, buttery, and crunchy on the outside. I could eat a whole plate of biscuits. Service was slightly lacking. We only got refills on water once the whole time we were there and we had to ask for it. We were empty on waters for a while and it was more of a last resort to ask them. We were hoping they would come by before.

While on a short vacay for New Years, my husband and I had breakfast here twice and loved it! I had the French Toast and the second time I had the Egg & Bacon Tartine which was mouth watering good. Oh, and we tried all the beignets and they were delicious except for the apple one. So to conclude, I will be back despite the very, very long wait and random street people.

My friends came up from LA this Labor Day weekend. They really wanted some bay area food that they wouldn't be able to get in SoCal. I had originally wanted to take them to Cordon Blue off California/Polk because it's just so damn good, authentic and a really good experience. They were closed T___T So we walked out asses down to Brenda's with me telling them how great Brenda's is suppose to be with all the reviews and blah blah blah, Brenda's was such a disappointment this time. There was no wait at 9pm. We ordered: 2x strawberry ice tea 1 x beer 2 x crawfish beignets 1 x mac and cheese 1 x BFC (that friend chicken thing with collared greens - YUCK) 1 x chicken/sausage jambalaya (I got this previously) 1 x shrimp po boy The only thing that was really worth the price in my opinion was the crawfish beignets and mac and cheese.  The wait for the food was awhile, which I wouldn't have minded if it was good, but I didn't like the BFC and thought I could have just gone to the KFC next door to get a family meal value for the price I paid for their sad excuse of fried chicken at Brendas. My girl friend got the jambalaya, which I told her was good. I got this previously, but this time the rice and overall meal just tasted really dry. She hated it and didn't even finish half of it.  The only person that was satisfied was the person that got the po boy.  That's 1 out of 3 meal satisfaction :( All in all, would I come here again? Probably not for dinner and if I do, it probably wouldn't have been my suggestion in the first place. I am sure their breakfast is good, but the dinner was ALRIGHT.  Our bill came out to about 70 something (including tip).

After getting rejected at the Red Door Cafe (not exactly sure why because we thoroughly reviewed the rules), we made our way to Brenda's, and were ecstatic that we did. Started with the Beignet Sampler - in order of deliciousness:  (1) Granny Smith, (2) Chocolate, (3) Plain, (4) Crawfish.  The Crawfish was interesting, but just didn't fit with the rest - probably better to order on its own, separate from the rest! My wife's Sweet Potato Pancakes weren't quite as good as my French Toast, which absolutely exceeded my expectations. Will definitely try to return on this trip!

My bf and I tried to come here for brunch but it was over 1.5 hr wait so we gave up. We decided to try it for dinner yesterday and it was a 5 min wait for the two of us. I felt like a sardine being squished into a can because the tables were so close together, I thought I was going to knock someone's drink over when I went to the restroom! Watermelon iced tea: Don't bother. It wasnt cold enough and it wasnt flavorful enough for me. (but my friend said hers was too sweet last time she went.... maybe I got a bad batch :( Crawfish beignets are huge! we got one each and I liked how it was fluffy and had all this filling inside. The chef had a heavy hand with the old bay seasoning (i think that's what it was on the outside at least) but overall I liked this appetizer. Hushpuppies: I normally dont like hushpuppies but these were pretty good. I wish we didnt order so much food so we'd appreciate them more. The crawfish beignet was better though Brenda's Fried Chicken: came with collard greens and a biscuit. That fried chicken was hella juicy! wow. The jam for the biscuit was tasty too. I didnt like the collard greens but my bf did *shrugs* Catfish poboy: came with a choice of cole slaw or fries. He chose the cole slaw but I didnt think they were anything special. The catfish was nice and flaky. Overall, Brenda's really filled us up but we realized that all of our food was fried so we had to go home and drink some tea to help digest all that oil. Good to try at least once but I dont think I'll be a regular soul food eater

I would rarely say any restaurant is worth an hour and a half wait, but this one was. We had the beignet flight (sampler). Also at our table: shrimp and goat cheese omelette. Croquette Monsieur.

Looking around at other diners' plates I wished we could have tried more because it all looked good.

It was the perfect place for a HEARTY brunch!  Don't go if you are looking to feel light, because the portions are enormous, but delicious!   The biscuit looked dense and the size of a baseball, but happened to be light,   The crawfish beignets come in three and are HUGE.  People who take pictures of them should show something to show how big they are because they are the size of a fist.   Be aware.  Again they are delicious. Gumbo, shrimp and grits, thick cut bacon and eggs, potatoes,  YUM! It's not light, but what soul food is?! The service was excellent and got in early we didn't have to wait.  I would go here again.

The beignet sampler was really tasty and almost a meal in itself.  The crawfish was savory, the plain was soft and sweet, the apple was fruity and sweet, and then the chocolate was really rich and yummy.  The BFC was really good fried chicken, juicy and crunchy.  The shrimp and cheese grits were good, just have the tomato sauce on the side.  There was a pumpkin pancake special too so I had to try it.  Glad I did but I could barely eat just one pancake as it was so thick and heavy, in a good way of course.  The andouille sausage was added just to compliment the pancake.

I was not impressed. The BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) wasn't particularly flavorful, the gumbos all had that weird bleachy aftertaste, and the watermelon iced tea that I was super excited about ended up tasting like medicine. The best part of the meal was actually the corn bread. Perhaps I'll give Brenda's another shot when they serve their famed beignets. Beware - they only serve them during certain hours and their menu in general is pretty confusing. Check ahead of time!

Their pictures of food are DEFINITELY better than how they tasted There wasn't that long of a wait because we sat at the bar.  We ordered the jambalaya, grits, beignets, catfish po' boy, and watermelon ice tea.  Beignets were EXTREMELY salty.. I proceeded to drink the watermelon ice tea because I needed to diffuse the saltiness of the beignets and since they never gave us water and it tasted unpleasantly not sweet.. Then I hoped that the grits would be better.. but unfortunately.. I just tastes butter, cheese, and grease.. not happy.. by the time I got to the catfish po' boy I was losing hope.. but surprisingly this was the best dish! I only took a bite out of the jambalaya but from what I remember it was just whatever.   Their service is whatever.. their food is definitely not worth it.. and place is cute.. but seriously 20$+ just for meh food.. no thank you.. will not be coming back

Whew. Definitely a foodie experience. I walked a mile from my hotel to go to Brenda's - as it was the highest rated yelp in that vicinity.  Depending on what part of town you're coming from (I'm staying by Union Square) you may not be walking through the best part of town to get to your destination - but it was early on a Sunday morning and a sunny, beautiful day out! I tend to be an early riser but didn't make it to Brenda's til about 10:20, by this time there was already quite a large line (1:20 estimated wait). As I was flying solo, I decided to skip the queue and do takeout. I struggled between getting a pork belly and cheesy grits and tomato/scallion spicy relish special or the vegetarian omelette but was recommended the former.  Food came out before the next person in line even sat down.  As previous posters mentioned, if you want to skip the wait on a weekend- get there early! Verdict: Delicious.  I woofed down less than half of the portion and was full in 1/8 of the time it took me to get to Brenda's and back.  Portions will leave you taking something home!  Eggs were perfectly poached and a nice accompaniment to the tomato/scallion relish.  The cheesy grits (if they offer these again or in any other capacity don't hold back!) were super yummy, but quite heavy - If you don't want a super rich breakfast, probably not the best option.  Pork belly just right - i prefer mine a little less fatty so ate around it.   All in all worth the experience if you're wanting to switch up your regular brunch menu.

Came here on a Wednesday evening and did not have to wait at all.  The restaurant is located in the Tenderloin.  It's kind of a shady neighborhood and you definitely want to walk around with a buddy.  But once you step inside this cute restaurant, you are transported to another place.  I love the decor and the comfy bench seats along the wall.   This was my first-time here.  I've heard about this place a million times.  Finally made it here for my belated birthday dinner.  The waitress was friendly, even though she accidentally ran into my chair several times. We shared the crawfish beignets.  This is the first time I've ever tried savory beignets.  It's usually the usual sweet ones in the past.  This was actually very good!  The filling was so creamy and satisfying. I ordered the bronzed catfish served with crawfish étouffée (a delicious sauce) and rice.  The fish was so tasty and so moist.  I loved every bite!  My boyfriend had the BFC ( Brenda's secret-recipe fried chicken).  It was served with a biscuit and collar greens.  He ALWAYS offers me a tasting, but this time he didn't.  HAHA, he must've loved it!  My girlfriends ordered the shrimp & grits and the shrimp pot pie.  They all looked delicious too!   For dessert, we shared the bing cherry chocolate bread pudding.  I wanted to lick the plate.  I cannot wait to go back for more!

So dayum good! And I love that it's in the Tenderloin, where I live. Another gem of many in the area. I went on my off day on a Friday for lunch. There was already a long line. You write your name on a chalkboard.. don't forget to do that! After about 30 minutes we were seated. Started out with the crawfish beignets. Who could resist?? Really really good!! They prob can be a meal on their own haha. But I have a big appetite. So I also order the special: crispy pork belly in cheddar grits with poached egg. Can you say heaven?? Wow really tasty. And very filling. Even though it looks small.. it is heavy indeed. My partner ordered another special, fried chicken po boy which he really loved. We'll have to order the fried chicken plate next time because it sounds sooo good! I also loved the atmosphere, service was good. Overall a winning place!

This place is legit. Awesome breakfast. I'm not a breakfast lover at all but would put Brenda's at the top of my list. Pulled pork eggs Benedict? Yea, please. Only downfall is place is small so usually a wait. Get there early. The flip em pretty quick. Easiest is to as 1-2 people. They have a 4-5 person bar top for solos.

Keeping with the ideology of saving the best for last, I always eat at Brenda's before departing San Francisco.  This tradition may be one of the worst ideas ever conceived.   A five hour drive with some combination of those scrumptious crawfish beignets, catfish eggs benedict, shrimp and grits, and about a gallon of watermelon iced tea sitting in your stomach feels like an eternity.  The itis kicks in about an hour south of the Bay Bridge, making you wonder why on earth you didn't just eat at Brenda's when you could have devoted the rest of the afternoon to laying on your stomach.  Then you realize that indulging in Brenda's at an earlier stage of your trip would make your subsequent meals in San Francisco taste like cardboard by comparison.  It's just that good.

Definitely hyped up. The food? Probably worth the hype. The fact the waitress took my plate away from me while it still had red beans and rice residue and I had a biscuit on a side plate really upset me though. I mean I ordered the biscuit to do the thing at the end with the sauce and then it got taken away from me while I had biscuit in my mouth. What gives? minus 2 stars for that....burr. I'll definitely be back another time, but this time I'm guarding my bowl a lot harder.

French soul food? GENIUS!! I've been to Brenda's twice and both times I've had a great experience. There is a wait, so expect it. Every bomb place in SF has a wait. My recommendations? Crawfish Beignets Porkbelly & Grits Shrimp & Grits The food is VERY good and VERY quality. The beignets are slightly crunchy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside and the taste of crawfish hits you oh-so pleasantly. The porkbelly had a lot of flavor and worked really well with the grits. Brenda is very generous with the amount of shrimp. The sauce and cheese mixed in with the grits all over the shrimp was...orgasmic. The food, by itself, at Brenda's is what earned the 5 stars. Everything else (decor, service, price, etc.) was nothing remarkable but was definitely on par. I left a happy man. :)

To quote from Mia in Pulp Fiction - GODDAMN, I said... GODDAMN! After our initial disappointing trip to the Boxing Room (overpriced, greasy, generally ugh) hubby and I were desperate to find a little touch of NoLa here in SF for date night. We totally should have done our research and gone here first. Seating was easy and quick and the service efficient and courteous (the waiter forgot that I had ordered an all-dark-meat 3 pc Fried Chicken, and when he realized his mistake, came back to offer me an extra piece of my choice even though we had already demolished the plate). And the FOOD.  Started off with a watermelon iced tea (yummmm), broiled oyster flight (humongous oysters with different seasonings - my fave was the one in a ridiculously buttery parsley sauce), crawfish beignets (like a lobster roll and empanada made love and moved to Louisiana), and the aforementioned BFC with a cream biscuit you want to take home to momma and propose to, so it will never, ever leave you. I wish I was like a cow (4 stomachs, get it?) because there was so much more I wanted to try. Alas, my caloric intake was already over the top by the end of the meal and I didn't have room for what looked like an EPIC chocolate beignet. Not to worry though - I know I will be back. Hell, I knew I was going to be back even before the fried chicken. Now to lie down, digest a bit, and dream of cream biscuits...

A taste of French soul food, indeed.. NOM NOMS. Ordered the shrimp & grits. Great choice. And of course the crawfish beignets. *insert iPhone heart emojis* these Louisiana donuts were fabulous, however I got full when I ate one & a half.. But I had an entree waiting for me, so I proceeded to eat the wonderful shrimp & grits. Great flavor and texture. Definitely worth a stop if you're visiting the area.. With some free time on your hands because there will most likely be a wait!!

Always very good, but be prepared for the eternal wait...  Big airy space, good for groups.  The ritual is: go around the corner to Philz and get yourself a nice coffee to help you tolerate the wait! Try the shrimp and grits, and of course, the full flight of beignets (at least once).

Come early before the rush, the wait is a minimum 30-40 minutes. Definitely worth the wait though. Definitely try the watermelon ice tea, crawfish beignets, and shrimp and grits. The servings are big for their reasonable prices. You definitely get a lot for what you pay for. Service is quick and group friendly.

pork belly grit is delicious, not on their menu you have to ask for it. They work as a team there, not a one server per table kinda deal, but still very efficient. The biscuit and jam was yummy as well. Delicious Food + Great service + inexpensive dishes = a satisfying, belly full, happy customer.

Halfway through my meal I wish I had worn yoga pants instead of skinny jeans. If you have eyes bigger than your stomach - this is the place where you'll get looped into ordering just about everything and anything .. do it with no shame. The wait can be infamous - but good things shine on those who come in for 1045am brunch on weekdays. Perhaps the Gods were smiling  on me that day - I think that must the karma for giving a random homeless person who approached my friends and I in the street money. [Restaurant borders on the tenderloin, so I'd recommend some caution as you walk around] Here's my run down: Beignet  flight- 4 of their menu beignet's. Just do it - because life's just better when you get a taste of everything. Overall I really liked their beignets - but they were a little bit too doughy on the inside for me, I like beignets that are a bit lighter and more hollow on the inside. plain - sprinkled with powdered sugar - just enough to be sweet, but not too overwhelming the crawfish -cheese and crawfish - if you had a shellfish allergy I would be so sad for you because this is something you can't pass up! It's sprinkled on top with something paprika and chili powder - problem is that this one comes on the same plate as the sweet beignets! You should ask for this one separate from the others - the whole mixing of chili powder and powdered sugar isn't ideal. Chocolate - I love chocolate - so I didn't have a problem with all the chocolate that oozed out from the inside - eat it while it's hot, you'll have no regrets apple - yum yum - a pocket full of apple and cinnamon with more powdered sugar on top? yes please. Finally, my favorite beignet - the chongo? It was the daily beignet ($2.75)  - nuts, cream cheese, chocolate, banana = YUM. My only mistake was splitting this with a friend. I got a sloppy josephine ($9)- and it was a really good spin on a sloppy joe - the meat had onions in it and it was flavored just right. Best part - the kaiser roll it sits on because the roll is delicious and strong enough to keep yourself from turning into a sloppy mess while eating a sloppy joe!. Either comes with fries or coleslaw, I recommend the fries they taste like mickey d fries - but better! And to wash it all down? get the watermelon sweet tea ($2.75) I really liked the hint of watermelon in the tea. I got it with half regular tea and it helped tone down the sweetness, I got a refill of the regular one and it was a little bit too sweet for my taste. Overall - Brenda's will leave you feeling full, happy and soul recharged. You will feel sleepy after too, but hey that's a good thing, right?

My friend and I were visiting San Francisco to get away for a bit and we had found this restaurant on Yelp. We walked over from Union Square and it wasn't a bad walk at all (the map had made it look farther than I anticipated). You walk in and sign your name on an old school chalkboard, they seat you down, and one wall is entirely covered in different-sized framed-mirrors. I love the effect! Its quirky and different of Brenda's that they have their utensils wrapped in linen napkins but the tables also have tin buckets which hold the condiments. We had arrived during their in-between lunch and dinner hour so they have a limited menu at that time. The waitress/server was gracious to let us wait for 10 minutes until the dinner hour was official so we could order from the full menu. (I say she was gracious because other establishments have either not seated me or pushed me to order something that I didn't really want.) I had the smothered pork chops (which were one of the specials) and my friend ordered Brenda's Fried Chicken. Both of us were impressed with the quality and quantity of food. The presentation of the plates was great: it really emphasized the main entree and its nice when your sides are mixing with each other :) I recommended this restaurant to my younger brother who resides in Daly City so that he can celebrate his anniversary here. I think its a great place for a date- only you would have to go other places for the other part of the date because it wasn't in the most attractive part of the city!

I was SO excited to try this place out! I looked at the menu the night before and was so giddy with excitement that I could barely sleep that night! (ok maybe a bit of an exaggeration) Everything on the menu sounded so good, I almost had a mini life crisis trying to decide what to get. In the end I got the Hangtown Fry, Chocolate Beignets, and orange juice. The food was SO. GOOD. The Hangtown Fried had perfectly fried oysters shelved inside a nicely cooked egg, tasty biscuit and grits. The grits were somewhat watery and smelled like rotten eggs though, so I recommend getting the hash. The beignets were fresh out of the oven and very sweet and cute but a bit dry. The place is located in somewhat of a ghetto, but don't worry, it's a classy establishment! Very quaint and cozy inside... perhaps a bit too cozy, as we could literally hear everything our the people in our neighboring table 2 inches away were saying about their fishing trip. We went during brunch time and there was a short wait but not too bad. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!

After my friend and I ran across the Golden Gate Bridge and then some (an adventure in itself...), we needed some soul food to fill us back up. We were pretty sweaty and disgusting from running, but WDGAF! We shared a flight of beignets in addition to our entrees, which were of course deliciously a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend who was a first-timer to Brenda's wanted to save a crawfish beignet until after he was done with his entree, but I told him to trust that he wouldn't have any room afterwards. Good thing he listeneddd... I've stopped by here on the way back to Vallejo JUST to pick up beignets for my roomies, because they hadn't experienced the salivatory goodness that comes with each flavor. It's been too long...I need more Brenda's in my life!

**BEST SOUL FOOD BRUNCH EVER** Dude I just came back from eating at this place and I am so full and satisfied that I have to write a review right now! MUST ORDERS: Watermelon iced tea, Pork belly special, Biscuits, Catfish & Apple begniet (and Cheesy Grits if it doesn't come with yr meal)! The pork belly special with cheesy grits, poached eggs and their delicious tomato and onion relish is amazing!! The Pork belly is tender and flavorful and is just a wonderful combination with everything else in this meal. Cheesy grits are bomb!  It's a special but it looks like its one they have often. This is a must order if you can. The catfish begniet is this delicious unsweetened pastry filled with those cheesy saucy catfish goodness covered w a paprika cajun rub. If you're not feeling so fishy and have a sweet craving, the Apple with powdered sugar are delish too!! Each order on the menu comes w 3 (and the flight comes with 4) but you can also ask for just one or half orders of pretty much anything! They are so great and flexible (unlike snobby Red Door Café half a mile away- ugh don't even get me started). The biscuits are flakey and buttery. Delicious with the homemade strawberry preserves. Soo good! For southern breakfast foods, this place gets 5 stars! Service was also awesome. I want to try their shrimp, oyster or catfish po boy next time because they look amazing!!

All you have to do to avoid the wait is get there before 8:30am on Sunday. Or, as in my case, get up at 5:30am, run the SF Half Marathon, and come here to gorge on a post-13.1-mile-run reward. * Beignet flight - 4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… (plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, crawfish. $9.50) Got this before, absolutely worth getting it again. The dough is soft, chewy and moist. The fillings all great, though the crawfish and chocolate get a special note. I would say the apples are a little undercooked - just a personal preference, I like my apple desserts to be super soft so there isn't much crunch to speak of. * Pulled pork eggs benedict - 4 stars (cross-section image) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… (full plate image) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… (on cream biscuit w/ hash or grits - a Sunday brunch special. $9.75) Delicious! The biscuit was soft and buttery, just right. The yolk was runny. The pork juicy and delicious. Everything was in the right proportions. My only regret was not getting the hash - the table next to us all got hash and it looked delicious. The grits come in a huge bowl, and I got it because we weren't hungry enough to order their famous shrimp & grits, but plain grits just really aren't too impressive. They had good texture but were really plain in flavor and were pretty oily too. I like the new space as well! Twice the size means half the wait.. right?

The food here is just so scrumptious and the service, speedy and unpretentious (especially nice since this popular outpost has long been discovered by the hipster set). The cream biscuits, the beignets and any of their specials are a damn fine way to start your Sunday, all washed down with their delicious chicory-laden coffee. Try to get there when they open: This place is so slammin' that even with their expansion that doubled their seating, you will wait (and wait and wait) but it's worth it.

An interesting place to eat, truly authentic soul cuisine. A friend who works nearby, (who we came to visit) took us out to lunch here. We had the watermelon iced tea which was very interesting - a sweet, thicker tea mix with green watermelon shards...truly a one of a kind drink. My husband tried the crawfish beignets and said they were awesome. I had the Croquet Monsieur - an open faced sandwhich with ham and gruyere cheese that was divine. We found it neat that when you come in you put your name on a chalkboard list...and we didn't wait all that long even though they were in full swing lunch mode and the place is pretty small. The wait staff were very attentive,  the service was quick and the ambiance was spot on. Being from Austin, not many restaurants wow us while we are traveling, but Brenda's was awesome and I certainly hope I get a chance to eat there again someday.

Food for the soul indeed. I was in SF for one day, and although I never eat breakfast, this restaurant intrigued me with its menu... so I woke up in time for breakfast and dragged my boyfriend with me. So happy I did. I was immediately impressed upon walking in. The decor was so... different! Like, in a good way. I guess from the outside, you don't really expect a contemporary type of place, but it was decorated nicely and had a friendly atmosphere. We both got the watermelon iced tea, which was definitely different from any other iced teas I've had. It was sooo refreshing! I loved it, I wish they have watermelon iced teas everywhere, because I would order it all the time. We also got the flight of beignets, which came with 4 different types - crawfish, apple, chocolate, and plain. This was my first time having beignets, and I enjoyed them a lot! I think the crawfish one was the best, probably because I was just craving savory foods at the time. But the other 3 were also good! Soft, fluffy, and slightly sweet. I ordered the grillades and grits, which came with grits, braised ribs, 2 eggs of your choice (mine was over-easy), and some toast. IT WAS SO GOOD. The grits were creamy, the braised ribs were tender and flavorful, and eating them all together = party in my mouth. My boyfriend got the egg and bacon tartine, which was good too, but I liked my order 10x more :) I was already halfway full from the beignets, but I wanted to finish my meal soooo bad... I couldn't do it. Neither could the bf. So we just got a to-go box and put whatever else we had left into it. A few hours later, on our drive back to LA, I finished it all and enjoyed it just the same, even though it was cold. That's how good it was. I'm coming back to SF in a week, and I really really want to come back here to try more things and their watermelon iced tea!!!

We have always wanted to go here and indeed drove by here couple of times but saw sooooo many people lined outside the cafe, we just kept driving and found alternatives in the last few years. This time, my hubby and I got offs on the weekdays so we decided to pay a visit. This time, there was no line at 10 :30 in the morning and we were seated right away. We ordered crawfish beignets, hashed (rather baked) potatoes, shrimp girts and a cup of tea. Well, I think shrimp grits was pretty good, it's just way too salty for me though. Crawfish beignets are so so, smelt very fishy and I could not stand the smell..gave up after one or two bites. Fore some reason, it smelt stronger when it was hot but when we brought some home and was cold, it smelt less and was actually edible. We actually tried to order something else but unfortunately we could hardly understand the server, so we gave up ordering other stuff.... Honestly, I think this place is overrated. Or did I expect too much? Either way, this will probably our first and the last time going there...

So charming! Brenda's French Soul Food is a sweet little gem in the good old Tenderloin. First and foremost the brick wall and high glass celings make this a perfect location for breakfast, brunch or lunch. There's a bit of a wait, and for good reason. Shrimp and goat cheese omelet. On point. So good and so fresh. I opted for grits which was also a brilliant choice if I do say so myself. The cream biscuits are also incredibly fluffy and moist. Sit back, have a cup of coffee and enjoy yourself in this gorgeous little hideout.

Hmm...so. Three stars is probably generous. Someone described this restaurant to me as "a little Asian lady's interpretation of soul food..." and that's just about right. Which is to say: It's a little off. Which is to say: not authentic at all. First, the ridiculous wait. After waiting almost 90 minutes to eat, I was definitely delirious and expecting food that would absolutely blow me away. We started with the beignet flight which was very hit or miss. I've actually been to New Orleans many times, so I know what a beignet is supposed to taste like...and Brenda's ain't it. The dough is a little too heavy and nowhere near as fresh and delectable as what you'll get at Cafe du Monde. The crawfish beignet was good, but a little stingy on the crawfish. The chocolate beignet was not bad. The other two we left on the table... I had the shrimp and grits -- a favorite dish that makes me almost lick the bowl when I have it at Wishbone in Chicago. At Brenda's, eh...a little too much cheddar and the tomato sauce throws it ALL the way off. Overall, an unsuccessful attempt at sweet and savory. Despite all the hot sauce I poured on it, the sweetness of the tomato sauce was just overpowering. And, really, whose bright idea was it to put tomato sauce on shrimp and grits? Where I'm from that would get a chick kicked out of the kitchen with a boatload of "Chile, please..." The mimosas, however, were very, very good. I'm convinced all these five-star reviews are from people who have never eaten real seafood or authentic "low country" cooking. If you had, you'd know that Brenda's is just ok, but nowhere near great. But I guess in a locale like San Francisco, it's about as good as you're going to get...

I knew I was in the right place for Cajun food when I walked in and saw Steen's Syrup cans on every table! Steen's is made in my hometown, Abbeville, LA. It's a local specialty sort of like a sweeter molasses. I have NEVER seen it outside of Louisiana. On the tables they use the empty cans to hold silverware, but apparently Brenda's uses it in marinades, sauces, etc. Anyway -- I love this place and will go back often. Typically I don't like okra in gumbo, but Brenda's pulls it off -- really delicious, just the right amount of spice, lots of sausage, totally yummy. The casino oysters were off the charts -- with bacon, scallions, biscuit crumbs, parmesan, gruyère -- heavenly! Fried green tomatoes (honestly not a Louisiana thing, as far as I'm concerned) are good, but don't need to have them again. Amazing shrimp and cheese-grits -- again, the tomato sauce isn't too spicy, a really nice combo of savory and sweet. Fried chicken as good as I've ever had, with a fantastic side of greens (cooked with lots of bacon of course) and the lightest, fluffiest biscuit this side of the Mississippi. Finished off with some kinda chocolate/berry bread pudding with brandy sauce and fresh whipped cream. Sent me over the top, directly home and on to the couch for a coma-like nap.

I love brunch. I love southern food. And I loved Brenda's the first time I came. After coming back a couple times, the shiny newness is wearing off. Get ready - it gets crowded on the weekends. You write your name on the chalkboard with how many people and then hang outside for a while. It's usually been at least a half hour when I've been there with 3 people. FOOD: I've always gotten their flight of beignets. Not a fan of the apple, but the rest are tasty. As for food - I highly recommend the benedicts - I've tried the regular, the catfish and a pulled pork one. All delicious. Get them with the cheddar grits. I'd pass on the Hangtown Fry - it just wasn't as flavorful as the benedicts. But the french toast is also a good bet. And get a biscuit if your meal doesn't come with one. ENVIRONMENT: Sunny and bright and packed. So happy about their recent expansion - before it was just too tiny. Chalkboards hold the specials. Mismatched mirrors line the wall. It's a comfortable feeling place but expect feeling a bit crowded. SERVICE: My most recent trip there resulted in some less than stellar service. I'm willing to forgive a lot when you're dealing with a packed house. But you really do need to give us a minute to look at the menu before you ask us to order. And you really shouldn't drop the check when we've hardly begun eating (even if it was with a "whenever you're ready"). And the looks after we've paid and are just finishing our coffee - I get it, you're trying to move tables - I'm trying to finish my meal.

After my sis' SF half marathon run (whoo-hoo!), I figure we do breakfast in the city for once!  I did a Yelp search for brunch and I knew I wanted to go a REALLY REALLY good brunch place.  So going through my search results I see "Brenda's French Soul Food." I probably did a double take because wait...FRENCH?  SOUL FOOD?  BRUNCH!?!?! Holy scrumptious balls are you serious!?!?!  The 3 types of food I absolutely love! LET'S GOOOO!!!!! We came around 9am and it was packed.  However our wait was only about 20 minutes because I guess it was early and we were seated at a 2-person table for our 3-persons party. This place is so cute!  Did I mention that my favorite city in the country so far is New Orleans?  The restaurant decor was just cute!  So here's what we ordered: HANGTOWN FRY - $11.00 Crispy oyster, bacon & scallion scramble, hash, plus cream biscuit. The bacon bits in this was crunchy which I loved.  There was a generous portion of oyster in this scramble so you REALLY taste it....which can be a great or bad thing.  The hash side was more of a house potatoes/potato o'brien...which wasnt bad.  I felt this dish was unique and I"m glad I tried it!  Oysters and scrambled eggs, hmmm... FRIED CHICKEN EGGS BENEDICT - $11.00 Two poached eggs on cream biscuits with creole hollandaise, and hash. Oh man why didnt I think of this?!  Eggs Benedict on BISCUITS instead of ENglish muffins!  BOO-YEAH!  The hollandaise sauce was perfect...it had enough spice and I enjoyed the cajun flavoring.  However, I couldnt taste the fried chicken much.  It might have been because of the flavoring...but I still enjoyed it.  I guess I expected the taste of straight up fried chicken in this dish!   SPECIAL - CRISPY PORK BELLY, CHEDDAR GRITS AND SAUTEED ONIONS - $14? My FAVE!  I'm so glad I ordered the day's special!  The grits were perfect and had a great amount of cheese!  It also came with this sweet/spicy/lightly tangy sauteed onions for those who like a bit of kick in thier grits.  As for the huge slab of pork belly, it was amazing.  It was quite unctuous for those who enjoy fatty tasting foods in a good way like me...you'll love this dish!  YUM!!!!! BEIGNET FLIGHT - $9.50 One of every beignets they had!  Such a great idea! And they came out hot and fresh too!  They are just how I like them...warm and toasty!  And here they are: Chocolate - Who doesn't like pastires that are filled with chocolate?!  Apprently its filled with local's molten Ghirardelli chocolate that was pretty frickin' good.   Granny Smith Apple, with cinnamon honey butter - my oleast favorite...it tasted dry. Shrimp & Grits - Wow I never had a savory beighnet before!  I loved this!  The fillig was perfect with so much flavor and gooieness!  I thought the chili peper topping was funny withteh strong smell and I was really afraid I might accidently sniff some up my nose Plain - I didnt care for the plain since the others were elaborately filled! But hey, you enjoy a simple old fashioned beignet, then you cant go wrong with this one! I HAVE to come back.  I need an excuse to come back.  Dag nammit I'm coming back.

If people are willing to wait an hour to get seated for brunch on the weekend then ur place must be the shit! We're no stranger to brunch joints so we knew what to expect & was prepared to take it togo. Why the hour wait? Cuz the food is delicious & unique! The pork Benedict's were mouth watering. I got the sweet potato pancakes which I would say tasted more like pumpkin (not a fan of pumpkin.) it was pretty good for what it was. I'm sad we didn't get the crawfish beignets. Next time!

Easy 5. BRENDA'S FRENCH SOUL FOOD is one of those spots that you'll wake up early on a weekend for and walk through the Loin to stand in line for... Seriously. My wife and I stayed a couple of days in the city, so I polled a few local foodie friends about where to hit. All three separately said Brenda's for breakfast. And all three warned that we needed to get there early. We woke up and walked about eight blocks from Union Square to Polk through the Tenderloin. Bam! First in line! My wife of course rolled her eyes, I could see her calculating the extra minutes that we could have stayed in bed. Sure enough, by 8am (opening time), there was a line. I started with the Watermelon Sweet Iced Tea and ordered the Beignet Flight for us to share. The Beignets were MUCH bigger than I had anticipated - about the size of a baseball. We got the plain, the Ghirardelli chocolate, the Granny Smith apple and the Cheddar Crawfish (savory). We attacked them in that order. We both "Mmmm'd" on the first bite of the plain, and loved each of them. The chocolate may have been my favorite, wifey liked Granny Smith best. For my main course, I ordered the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict. I was torn between this item, and the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict. I let the waiter talk me into the Pulled Pork, and he fuckin nailed it. The BISCUITS that the benedict is anchored by... is the best friggin biscuit that I could even imagine. The next time I go, I might just get a plate of biscuits. Anyway, the pulled pork was juicy and delicious, and the eggs were poached to perfection. The delicious and dark hollandaise pulled it all together. Serious food orgasm. My lone gripe, the potatoes could have been a little warmer. But that was so minor. My wife had the Wild Plum Cobbler Pancakes and she was blown away how tart and delicious they were. One thing I can say about Brenda's - you really can taste the LOVE in their food. Which is a rarity these days. Overall, one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. 5 stars.

Interesting place. It's a pretty cute restaurant in a ghetto area. They don't take reservations so do come early and get your name on the list. They won't seat you until your whole party is here. Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Heard good things about this place so I decide to try it. French style brunch and soul foods, two of my favorites. They have some daily specials on the board near the front, you can also check in with your server about them. I ended up ordering from their regular menu, got a sweet watermelon iced tea and a fried catfish benedict with hash on the side. One of my friends ordered the fried chicken benedict, so I traded one of my catfish for her chicken. I've made a good decision. The wait for food was nothing compared to the wait for a table. The potatoes didn't look too great. Too mushy for my preference and too bland where I had to eat it with hot sauce. Maybe I should've ordered grits on the side, since it's more of a soul foods place. The benedict itself was pretty good. I liked how they switched up an English muffin for a biscuit. The salted buttery taste of the biscuit was very satisfying. I didn't enjoy the fried catfish too much though, it was a bit bland, though it was fried to a crispy texture, not too dried, not too hard. Fish was easier to cut through than the chicken, which was a bit on the dried side, but it had more flavor and went amazingly well with the biscuit and the rest of the benedict. My sweet tea was quite interesting. My first expectation was it's going to be as sweet as McDonald's $1 sweet tea. Turns out it was very refreshing, the watermelon helped tone down the sweetness. The taste of the watermelon was very subtle; after all, it's a flavored tea, not a juice. Definitely give that a try! Portions were pretty huge. Most of my friends couldn't finish their benedicts, and hardly finished half of the potatoes. It's probably the fried food and all the buttery delicious part. Indulge yourself in a fatty meal and enjoy!

Brenda's is great.  The shrimp po boy has this sauce that will party in your mouth.  The beignet sampler was mostly great.  They came out piping hot and my favorite one is probably the chocolate.  Thought there was too much paprika on the crawfish one but the cheesy filling was delicious.

Scrumptious. Delicious. All the tasty-cious. (making up words to just to describe how great Brendas is) I don't usually commute to SF much, so a friend suggested for me to go out and get some French Soul, in my mind i thought man I've been craving some soul food.. so why not?.. So me and two other friends ventured out to the city and boy were we in for a mouthwatering roller coaster ride! I'm not going to tell you how delicious it was, actually i already did but keep it quick and simple. Crawfish Beignet, Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict, and that thirst quenching house watermelon black tea. Oh boy.... let's just say as one of our fellow yelpers said..... it's not just good..... It's SOOOOOOOUUUUL GOOOD! Aside from the delicious food, the wait in line goes by super quick so even if there is a line, it's most definitely worth the short wait! Service was also excellent! The lady kept refilling my Watermelon tea for days!.. In the end.... we came out with epic food coma and went to enjoy the great view up at Twin Peaks. = Good Day and Enjoy Life.

The cafe has become too corporate like.  The crowded atmosphere was not appealing.  The food was not as fulfilling as previously.  The customer service was very abrupt.  We come from across the Bay and due to work and time, this only occurs when spend time in SF which is every couple of years.

Hate to be the bummer, but a few things that really underwhelmed me after all that anticipation to try this place: my hot chocolate came out warm. the hash on our plates all came out barely warm and were unremarkable flavorwise. Those are really disappointing things. Anyhow, the good things! The beignet sampler is such a great try if you have enough people, so everyone can take a bite and try each flavor. I will say though, I almost got full just eating "one" whole (a fourth of each variety) one. The chocolate was my favorite, and the crawfish was a great savory beignet (never had one like that before) - does have just a little kick to it, like a nudge. The banana foster french toast was my favorite. The rum sauce was probably the only thing I loved out of everything, over the chocolate beignet (unfortunately the unmaskable taste of oil in all deep fried just can't be won over with chocolate). My eggs benedict had perfectly poached eggs, but the biscuit underneath was almost hard and crunchy on the bottom, so I only ate the top, or whatever got soaked soft with the yolk. The molasses ham was interesting, a different sweetness - heavier and darker (as expected) compared with honey. Don't know if I like the combo of the molasses flavor with my eggs and biscuit though. Service was good - very attentive, but the host was rather irritated or impatient. Our name was called and we moved and stepped in front of him and said "here", and then somehow he didn't hear or notice us and so called some other group and we had to go clear that up.

End up having a love-hate relationship with this place. Coming here for brunch on the weekend is going to be packed, 1 hour wait at least for just a party of four. Let start out with the love: their Beignets are a-mazing. One order comes with three beignets and each beignet is like the size of your fist. I recommend the crawfish beignet if you are craving something savory. It's filled with spices, cheese and crawfish (can get fishy, so you have to like the seafood taste). Their apple beignets are also a delicious choice, sweet, crunchy and its like biting into a delicious apply pie. Honestly, I will only come here and order their beignets....only. Everything else on the menu was just a-okay, nothing special. Shrimp and grits: they put a shiz-ton of cheese in this dish. Like all I could taste was cheese. Every spoonful was just cheese and honestly after the first three bites, it just gets too heavy and too much. Also after it cools, its just a harden cheesy mush. Fried chicken benedict: Again, too heavy. Not only is egg yoke heavy, but add hollandaise sauce and fried chicken, its really hard to stomach the rest. I recommend sharing. Potato hash: Mine came out mushy and overcooked. It was disheartening when you can't even enjoy the potatoes. French toast: disappointment, just pain french toast, nothing special. Could have gotten this same french toast at any diner. Don't get the pecan syrup for 1.00 extra, way too sweet and not as good as plain syrup. Watermelon ice tea: delicious, free refills

ALRIIGHT. SO. Went to SF for the first time from Fri-Sun this past weekend. Ever since my bf and I had made the idea of going, he could not stop talking about Brenda's! And her shrimp po'boy. He's a tad obsessed :p . So, this is the very first place we went to when we arrived. Luckily it wasn't too crowded, and we got seated right away. The place is decent sized, and definitely sets the mood of soul. Workers are quick, and pretty nice. A lot of the dishes consisted mainly of seafood, obv, so I ordered their kick-ass burger (WHICH WAS FUCKING HUGE), the bf ordered their of course shrimp po'boy, and we ordered some plain beignets. Which were also effin huge! The beignets came out first, it came out literally 5 minutes later..to be completely honest though, the ones at Disneyland are better. But cha still get 5 stars! Our food came out, we were sooo hungry, and we just inhaled it. For me not liking seafood, their shrimp po'boy was REALLY good. Everything was perfect. Now my hamburger..was AMAZING. The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that the bread had too much powder on it. Other than that..A+++++ For the rest of the day..I didn't want to eat. I was so full. Sunday we came back again, this time for breakfast. We made it just in time before the crowd rushed in. AND IT GETS BUSY. When we finished, there were about 10 groups waiting. Bageeesus. Anyway, this time we ordered their banana Foster french toast (special for the day), bf ordered the shrimp n' grits, and I got their fried chicken eggs Benedict, also we split the sausage gumbo. Got the gumbo first, it was pretty good! French toast next, and holy effin shit..best french toast I think I've ever tasted! All the flavors just fit perfectly together. We ate everything. Next was our main meal. I've actually never tried eggs benedict before, so it was my first time. I liked it! The cheese had a peculiar flavor though..wasn't used to it so it kind of threw me off. But generally, it was pretty darn good. Bf's shrimp n' grits were great too. I just had the grits and cheese part. Btw, bf is in love with their watermelon iced tea. So if you is a fan of watermelon, I suggest you try it. It literally tasted like the watermelon went threw a juicer and they just serve it to you. WITH CHUNKS! GO BRENDA'S!!!!

I've been two this place twice now for lunch - each time telling myself I would write a review but never getting to it.   Folks at work have been talking about this place quite often, with the warning to show up early.  I couldn't agree more - make sure it's 11:30a.. don't show at 11:45 or you'll be in line with everyone else.  Restaurant is of a decent size, but due to folks coming here in larger groups - the wait can be long. This place has thousands of reviews, so I will spare you all the details.  Let's just jump to the food quickly! Beignets - FAB.  Order the spicy crawfish version and you'll have enough for a meal alone.   Greedy husband could not say no to TWO full orders of the spicy crawfish (savory) and the chocolate filled (sweet). Etouffee - freaking fabulous.  Tasty with the crawfish and such a filling dish Croque Monsieur - done very well and bechamel sauce was perfectly light BFC - husband could not turn this down the one time I brought him -- sucker for fried chicken.   Water melon sweet tea - must try.  Summer in a jar (literally) Interior - the restaurant is absolutely lovely.. and I inspired me to decorate my home in similar colors and motif.  Very modern, yet casual and rustic all at once.  Noise level is moderate - hey, it's a lunch place.. Sitting space can be crammed because of all the happy patrons. Service & Cost - expect to open your wallet, the place isn't cheap, but it's affordable.  The service is SLOW.  Both times I came here for lunch at 11:30, got seated by noon.. did not leave till 1:30p.  It's a two hour deal each time.  I blame it on their full tables and not enough staff.  * Minus one star here - Two hours is quite a bit of time to spend at a casual dining place during the lunch hour mid week. All and all, a fun place to eat and catch up.  Portions are gargantuan - you'll likely end up taking some home.  WOuld like to come back to try brunch one day.  But will have to set aside the time to dedicate to the meal!

We chose this place as our last taste of SF, and it ended up being a major waste of our time and money. We saw that it was busy, a 2 hour wait, so we decided to order to go and take our meal to the Palace of Fine Arts.   After noticing that they missed a portion of our food, we immediately called them, and not only  was the owner unapologetic, she was downright rude and condescending despite the mistake! I understand that she may feel a little stressed from her busy restaurant, but this attitude is in no way acceptable. I was hoping the food would make up for their lack of southern hospitality, and boy was I in for more disappointment - Watermelon Iced Tea- not sweet had a bitter taste to it. - Crawfish Beignet- crawfish did not taste fresh - Apple Beignet- The apple pie at Mcdonalds tastes better than this - Grillades and Grits- tasted ok in the beginning, a few bites in everything mixed together, looked like throw up and didn't taste consumable afterwards. Never again.

My boyfriend and I went here during our vacation to grab some dinner based on a suggestion by a local.  Since our bus was headed this way, we decided to go for it.  We wandered around a bit until we found the place (the sign isn't super obvious) and then walked in and put our names on the list. Despite several other names on the chalkboard list, we were seated almost immediately at a two person table.  The waitress was friendly and brought menus right away. I had a hard time decided what to get, but ended up choosing the Catfish Po' Boy.  My boyfriend got the Red Beans and Rice with Andouille Sausage.  As soon as the food showed up (which was incredibly [almost suspiciously] fast), I knew I'd made the wrong choice.  The Red Beans and Rice looked awesome.  I had a bite and it was pretty good.  My Po' Boy was fine, although quite spicy and very difficult to eat.  The toasted roll fell apart as I was eating it and the catfish just kept falling out.  Eventually I had to knife and fork it.  The catfish was good but it wasn't the best po' boy sandwich I have had.  The fries were pretty standard. We both had hot chocolate, since it was cold outside.  It wasn't particularly chocolate-y, but the warmth hit the spot. Prices were a little higher than I expected - $11 dollars for red beans and rice with one sausage seemed expensive to me!  And the hot chocolate was $3.25 each. Overall our dinner was fine, but nothing particularly impressive.  If I were to come back again, I'd likely try another dish.

Brenda's French Soul Food was quite frankly, nothing short of ahhmazzeballs! Infact. amazeballs would be the perfect word to describe the circular shaped goodies served at this particular establishment. lets get down to the nitty gritttyyyy!! FOOD: Me being a newbie, i decided to live dangerously, test my limits, see exactly how far the rabit hole went. ERRR! i was wrong. well not completely. I ordered the sampler to start off. Why? becuase i wanted to try new things. OK! so i heard that the crawfish beignets are the best. but hey. who wants to be like everyone else and scarf down 1000 crawfish beignets? So the sampler was A-ok. Chocolate was good, plain was good. The other was just not good enough to be memorable. Stick with the crawfish beignets. most memorable. I could eat 1000 of them. over the coarse of time that is. not in one sitting. SHRIMP N GRITZ! aside from the crawfish beignets. this was the the second most memorable dish, and also pushed me over the edge. I think i heard a button pop off my jeans after trying to push the hot steamy creole bad boy down. you have been warned extremely tasty and filling. would not recommend attempting this after the beginet flight. The side of sausage was good, altough i had to take it to go. SERVICE: Most excellent. I love how i was on vacation that day, and we beat the rush hour slam of people walking through the door no later then 5 minutes after we arrived. It was nice to be able to walk write in and dig in! Waiter was most attentive in making sure we had a great dining experience. Brenda: "Ill be back!"

Yummy! I made the mistake of ordering the beignet flight by myself. While I wouldn't repeat this mistake again for the sake of my body fat percentage, it was delicious! The best was definitely the crawfish, with its savory, gooey center, but it was followed very closely by the chocolate. It was like a chocolate croissant on steroids - mmmmm. I thought the apple cinnamon was good, but paled in comparison to the other flavors, and I wisely stopped before getting to the plain beignet. I went on a horribly rainy morning, which allowed me to get in and get a seat right away. It got uber-crowded by the time I got my coffee, but I never felt rushed to finish or leave my table (I did anyway - it's good manners). Anyhow, I will definitely be back and I'm so glad to have tried Brenda's.

If you plan on getting the Beignet flight (1 of each, so 4 total), make sure you have a bigger group of people or not eating anything else or expect to have leftovers (but no one wants to eat leftover beignets -_-). The beignets are huge! And to be honest, I wasn't completely in love with them. They're a bit too heavy for my liking. I like them smaller and fluffier and hidden in a giant mound of powdered sugar. As for their other dishes, very yummy! I don't think you'll be disappointed with their grits (we had the pork belly grits).. comfort food for sure! We also had the Hangtown Fry (Crispy oyster, bacon & scallion scramble) which I would totally recommend and eat again any day.   Wish my tummy was bigger for meals like this one. I think what would've made the meal better and not as overwhelming is if our dishes came out first and beignets came out last. But we got the beignets first which is SO filling and if you don't eat it right away while it's hot out the fryer, then it won't be as good!! GRR.

Late post. My bff and I thought, "Hey it's Labor Day. Brenda's shouldn't be too busy. Let's get some breakfast!" We were so wrong... We arrived in the early AM and the line was long. We put our name down on the chalkboard and walked to Philz to get some coffee. We walked back to Brenda's and stood outside and watched each name be crossed off the list. About an hour later, we were finally seated and I was ready to grub! What we ordered: beignet flight (plain, chocolate, granny smith apple and crawfish), hangtown fry (oyster, bacon & scallion scramble) and I believe the shrimp & grits. We made the mistake of eating the beignets first bc they were so sweet and filling. I got so full off of the beignets that I could barely put a dent in my hangtown fry. And OMG that crawfish beignet is AMAZINGGGGG. I wished we had more than just the one to share. I will definitely be coming back! I want to try the watermelon tea next time and order 10 crawfish beignets!

Brenda's does good work with their breakfast and their lunch. Real Community Coffee, mind-blowing beignets (SP??), and a solid poboy. the less than stellar neighborhood and parking situation are the only negatives, and certainly shouldn't deter you. Oh, I forgot, you should probably bring a wheelbarrow so you can have someone carry you out.

Brenda's is one-of-a-kind. My coworker recommended I come here on my trip so we did. My friend ordered the Pulled Pork Egg Benedict. I'm not the biggest fan on pulled pork but the Egg Benedict itself was good. It came with red skin potatoes cooked well, not too mushy or undercooked. My friends really enjoyed the dish. My boyfriend and I ordered the Crawfish Beignet. We attracted a lot of attention from the table next to us when the waitress brought us our dish. The party next to us asked what it was so I told her. Then I took a bite and turned around and told her she better order some or she'll regret it. One of the best thing I've ever put in my mouth! Not only was it hot and cheesy, the crawfish was of decent size and tasteful. My boyfriend was impressed by the portion and the size of the crawfish as well. I let my friends tried some, of course, and they even gave it a thumbs up. Hands down, one of my favorite eats during this SF trip. If you're visiting SF, this is a must stop eatery. The wait can get very long. You write your name on a huge chalkboard against the wall, I thought that was pretty cool. The restaurant itself is not the biggest but you can order to go if you'd like.

Absolutely diiiiiivine. Hands down my favorite restaurant in San Fran. No wait at 6pm on a Saturday - yes, this is super early but after a meal at Brenda's you will want time to digest. Everything here is delicious but my favorite dishes are the Shrimp & Grits and the BCP Fried Chicken.  I am normally not a fan of grits but I wanted to lick this plate! The grits were super cheesy without being too heavy.  The Shrimp were bursting with flavor and the grits included surprising bursts of tomato and sausage flavors.  We ordered a biscuit to go with the grits but it was definitely not needed because we were scooping it up by the spoonful.   The BCP Fried Chicken rivals the Grits in flavor.  The batter is extremely light but bursting with southern deliciousness - I could have eaten a bucket of these! We also shared the cooked oysters (get the sampler, you won't regret it), the gumbo (good but easily overshadowed by everything else) and the crawfish beignets were very unique. I didn't care much for it, but everyone on Yelp and my husband loved it. We didn't have room for dessert but when has that ever stopped anyone?  We ordered the bread pudding special which my husband finished in minutes and yes it was THAT good. P.S. - Don't forget to order the Sweet Watermelon tea, which has unlimited refills.  I think I drank 4 glasses!

I love, love Brenda's for brunch.  Get the Hang Town Fry, get it.  It's a bacon and scallion egg scramble with corn meal crusted fried oyster.  Eat this with hot sauce...just do it!  The grits and cream biscuit are a must.  They make homemade jam, so you can enjoy your biscuit with buddah and jam.   I've been there for dinner as well.  They have the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken), and specials like pork chops.  I like the brunch food a bit more, but if you're looking for a heavy and filling dinner this is the place to try.

The food: a lot of Cajun based restaurants are popping up and claiming excellence but Brenda's is the real deal. Every time I've been the food is delicious; you feel like a real Southern Grandma put some legitimate heart and soul into your breakfast! I usually trust the specials; one time I got the Bananas Fosters french toast and it was the best I've had...ever. The Hangtown Fry is pretty good and savory, but the Po boys and anything with a biscuit is always blow your mind delicious. The good: I came to Brenda's when it was just a little hole in the wall, and a few years later post-expansion it's still delicious. This is a genuine food place that dishes up terribly unhealthy, but wonderfully tasty food. The bad: Brenda's doesn't take reservations, so beware those weekend mornings where the crowd trails out the door and onto the streets. It's best for weekdays, or- if you're a good planner- if you go an hour or two before you know you'll be hungry. Ambiance: cozy, hipstery vintage decor, squeaky clean bottles with Louisiana hot sauce and homemade jam perched side by side. What to know: The carby dishes (pancakes/french toast), the biscuits, po boys, and beignets all complete for the spotlight. Good for: small parties- beyond 5 or 6 people, it'll be one heck of a wait. Out of towners are also in for a treat here but don't bring your fanny packs or the locals will sneer. In short: Brenda's has terrific food and they know it! Great southern cooking and hospitality.

Yay! Brenda's offers dinner now. I've been here for breakfast a few times and normally order the beignets. If you're unsure of which beignets to order, go for the fight as it comes in four: plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, & crawfish. The beignets are good, but still can't compare to Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. I wish they put a little more filling in their beignets. I came here for dinner a few weeks ago and ordered their special: duck confit with dirty rice.  The duck was moist and was full of flavor. However, I didn't care for the dirty rice. It had a weird taste. The dish was a good size for me as I don't eat a lot. However, I read some other Yelpers reviews and I dont' agree Brenda's serves a generous portion - not for their special anyway. I also ordered the Sweet Watemelon House Tea, which is their iced tea. It was nice and refreshing.

Yum, yum, yum. Hubby's fav meal of the day is Breakfast.  Then again, anyday, anytime where there's food, is his fav meal.  I've been wanting to come back to Brenda's for a while, esp. since it remodeled.  If you want a seat, you have to come early.  The place was near full by 8:45AM.  It's about double the seating it used to be and you don't feel as if you're bumping into the diner seated next to you.  They basically tore down the wall to the property next door and did keep the wooden bar/stools and table/chairs.  One large wall had that distressed look with barren cracked concrete and was painted with a large shellfish that looked like it had been there for ages. The waiter told me it was painted on last yr.  Pretty cool. The menu has changed some with new dishes and daily specials. The couple next to use shared a choc and savory beignet.  I really wanted one but knew that I wouldn't be able to finish.  A couple of dudes another table over did just that - had 3 beignets, could only finish 2 and couldn't finish their breakfast.  I've always liked Brenda's beignets better than the ones served at the legendary Cafe' du Monde in NOLA, they smother theirs in a ridiculous amt. of powdered sugar. I had the hangtown fry again.  Sm. oysters, bacon, lots of green onions encased in an egg omelet.  Yummy.  Choice of grits or hash - I had the hash.  It was chunks of poatoes covered with paprika.  Large biscuit was flaky and good! We had community coffee with chickory which was served in a large round cup and endless refills. Hubby tried something new, a cornmeal crust chicken breast eggs Benedict on top of their biscuits. Hubby thought it was very good but wanted a larger serving of chicken meat but said it was very big.  He would only share a morsel, so there was not really a way for me to tell if tasted that good. We ended up taking our leftovers home for lunch since we couldn't finish.  Jr. Yelper came here earlier in the week for their fried chicken lunch & said it was pretty good. Breakfast for 2 = $30, no beignets. The wait staff was pleasant but they seem rushed most of the time.

Dinner at Brenda's French Soul Food was a first for me last night.  I am always satiated after I get something southern and heavy in me...esp. if I have the crawfish beignets and shrimp and grits...this place makes me want to click my heels and pile on the calories.  They serve brunch through the evening which is awesome...especially if you didn't get out of bed until after brunch was officially over. Last night I tried the fried chicken with collard greens and biscuit.  It was pretty good-greasy and flavorful.  However, my best opinion on fried chicken is at Orphan Andy's in the Castro.  Order the crawfish beignets and shrimp and grits.  They will always make me a return customer and likely you too.

This review is for brunch only (although I'm sure the dinner is just as good). I've been here twice and have ended up ordering pretty much the same thing both times because I've enjoyed it so much. I ALWAYS get their crawfish beignets. They're unlike any beignet I've ever had and have the perfect amount of spice and filling. The second time I was here we got the flight of beignets and I have to say none of them disappointed. My second favorite was definitely the chocolate. For my meal I got the Hangtown Fry. This is an egg scramble with HUGE and delicious oysters in it. It also has some bacon and scallions in it but the star of the dish is the oyster. You can get it with their famous biscuits which are divine. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their food. I had a bite of my friend's shrimp and goat cheese omelette and would definitely get that one the next time I come. The service is great and it's not too crowded if you get there when they open at 8 am. Definitely a worthwhile place to come to and it'll leave you full all day!

this place is just SOOOO GOOD! it was so crowded that we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table for lunch. We go the chicken, saussage and okra gumbo, Beignet flight (since we wanted to try  them all), shrimp and grits, and hangtown fry, and the sweet watermelom house tea. I dont know where to begin since they are all super duper awesome. Their Beignets are just awesome! the chocolate filling and crawfish were my favourite, very flavourful and just perfect! their hangtown fry and shrimp and grits are definitely a must have! they are not stingy on their oysters and shrimps, and thier biscuits are just the BEST! so soft and once you bite the,, you just keep wanting more! 45 minutes was totally worth the wait! will totally come back here.

Upon walking in, there is a chalkboard wall to the right.  If the line is long, write your name down and go for a short walk to Philz coffee or something (you can't bring back the drink though.. they strictly enforce the "no outside drink" policy) and you'll avoid the dreaded 1-to-2 hour wait out on the streets of TL. The portions are really BIG! I mean, humongous. Ginormous.  Brachiosaurus.  For a party of two, ordering 2 entrees and an appetizer is alone a daunting task. I highly recommend the beignets for appetizer (3 big chocolatey pieces), and the shrimp and grits. The coffee here is okay.  This is seriously going to be an awesome brunch. Enjoy!

I would go as far as saying Brenda's was perfect in every way a restaurant should be, but they sure came exceptionally close. Have their crab beignet, gumbo, jambalaya and their fried chix, they won't  disappoint. The establishment also seems to have very skilled BOH and charming FOH. Another plus is their no reservations policy. If the restaurant is good, people will wait to eat.I don't like to give 5 stars, but I feel like they earned it. You gotta try it for yourself.

- Got there at 12:30p Saturday and waited 45min-1 hr. The wait seems really long at first because there's a list on the chalkboard, but some people aren't willing to wait so it may go by faster than you think :) - Watermelon iced tea: perfect! Its super refreshing, not sugary and you get refills! GET IT! - Beignet flight: 1 regular, 1 chocolate, 1 apple & 1 crawfish = delicious! Its pretty big and filling so if you're here with only one other person and each ordering your own entree, you'll probably bring these home. You must get this!! - Coffee: skip it. It has a sour taste to it. - Shrimp & grits: tasty but oh so cheesy! I would suggest that if you order grits, have the person you're with order something else and share so that the cheese isn't overwhelming.

had the Crispy pork belly over cheesy grits with poached eggs and the delicious house coffee...and sweet potato pancakes...everything was delicious. The wait wasn't bad at all even though there was about 6 parties ahead of us. The crew was incredibly friendly and made the process a breeze, especially because we had a movie to catch.

Best soul food I've ever had. Ate an early dinner here on a weeknight and we walked right in at around 5:00. My fried chicken with collard greens and a biscuit was divine, and the dessert beignets were off the charts good. My leftover chicken and biscuit were even better, cold, the next day. The service had some 'tude, but the food was so good it eclipsed any hurried weirdness from the staff.

Let me start out by saying that the food is great, but the service is what I am giving it 2 stars for. Our waitress, Meghann was just horrible. We waited about one hour to get seated in which they then decided to tell us that they ran out of their world famous French toast. How do you run out of your best dish? Okay that wasn't the waitress's fault but the heads up would have been nice. We order the beignet sampler, we asked the waitress if we can switch out one for the beignet of the day and she responded with "no, we don't do that." Why freaking not?! Couldn't she have at least checked?? It was an even exchange! Once we got the food (45 minutes after we ordered) Meghann never came by to ask us how the food was, if we wanted a refill, or how we were doing! Rude. We also got served cold potatoes, so I asked her if she can reheat them.. she said yes..and disappeared. Once I found her I told her to just cancel the order. She then  came back with them AFTER we were done with our meal..at that point I said I cancelled them..she said "oh they are already here" plopped them on the table and left. Another waitress came by and said she would take that off the bill for us. Overall--like I said, food was good. Meghann needs some help though.

Oh so good! I'll chime in with the over 2000 other yelpers to say that this place is a must-eat destination. I had the sweet potato dumplings and the sauce it came in was heavenly. My sister had the rice and beans (though we all agreed it was more bean than rice) and my dad had the shrimp and grits which he raved about. Niece and nephew had mac and cheese and BFC. Mac and cheese didn't get such great reviews from a 6 year old but I liked the complex flavors. We started with the crawfish beignets which live up to their reputation. The only disappointment for me was the biscuits--not quite flaky or buttery enough and the texture was too dense. I'll definitely be back to try some other dishes!

Brenda's is my go-to spot for a delicious rampage on my arteries. It's good old-fashioned soul food with a welcome twist that will leave wonderful impressions on your tastebuds. The wait is long for weekend brunch, but the food is definitely worth it. I've had Brenda's countless times and every dish is as good as it sounds. My personal favorite is the fried catfish eggs benedict, which is heavier than anything you've ever had, but packs so much buttery fried goodness that you completely forget that you're essentially swallowing sticks of butter and shots of oil into your bloodstream. The crawfish beignets are also not to be missed. Granted the beignets are not as light and crispy as beignets should be, but the cheesy crawfish interior is worth every decadent bite. Wash it all down with their unbelievably refreshing watermelon sweet tea and you have yourself a delicious brunch that will guarantee painful laziness for the rest of your Sunday, plopped on your couch with intermittent proclamations of "Why the hell did I eat that shit for brunch?!?" Enjoy!

My cousin's coworker recommended this place so we came to check it out. The place was packed when we came (around lunch time - our fault). We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We ordered the infamous SHRIMP & GRITS and a BEIGNET FLIGHT to share. The SHRIMP & GRITS ($13) was absolutely scrumptious. There were so many bold, soulful flavors going on and they all play together well. The cheese grits was melted all the way through and immersed together with spicy tomato-bacon gravy. The shrimp was great as well as the little bacon bits. Note: I always thought grits to have a soft, yet grindy texture considering that I googled an image of grits. But no, the cheese grits were very soft and you don't even notice them that much, there was so much cheese going on. Stringy, stringy cheese when you put a spoonful in your mouth (you always have to wipe off the cheese strings that result. I really wished I had more when the dish was empty. The BEIGNET FLIGHT was a little bit too much for me. I loved beignets, but the flight was a lot. The PLAIN beignet was my favorite. Probably because it sweet and simple. You really get to appreciate the taste of the pastry and powdered sugar. The CHOCOLATE beignet was also tasty but only if you're a chocolate fan because there are pockets of dense chocolate in that beignet. The APPLE PIE beignet I could have done without. As for the CRAWFISH beignet, I'm not a big fan of crawfish, so it would be last on my list. I wouldn't mind visiting Brenda's again, but would love to snag a taste of the other many delectable dishes they offer.

Fantastic service and food. The atmosphere is homey, surprisingly spacious, and down to earth. It was our first visit and the server helped us figure out what we would like to eat. We got the beignet flight which is basically your choice of any 4. We got the plain, apple, chocolate, and crawfish beignets. My favorites were definitely the apple and crawfish. The crawfish provided the "savory with a kick" flavor, and the warm, soft apple beignet was perfectly sweet and filling. I would love to come back here to try some of their other southern style dishes. I'm really intrigued by their shrimp and grits plate. Brenda's is located on the corner, right on the street. Street parking was plentiful on a Friday morning.

I WOULD give this place 5 stars, if it weren't for the hour and a half wait to get a table.  Seriously - SF is too freaking cold to wait that long outside.   Though the food WAS delicious.  I had French Toast with a Pecan Sauce (which HAD to have been caramel) - and almost died.  It was AMAAAZING.  I also ordered beignets - I took one bite and left the rest.  SO gross if you're expecting anything like the delicacies found in NOLA.  But for those who haven't had those, these are probably the best thing ever.   Our server was great - guiding us both to her favorite dishes.   I can't say I'd go back - I refuse to wait that long for breakfast (my stomach was eating itself, I tell ya).

Amazing FOOD. First let me say there is going to be a wait. So expect that. I've been here a numerous times and had to wait every time, but that's how you know it's good. Food is worth the wait, especially if you order the beignet flight and cheesy grits with your meal. The establishment is small and there is limited seating. However it encourages you to socialize with others, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Oh by the way, it's in the nitty gritty Tenderloin district so expect crack heads, knuckle heads, and homeless people while you're waiting on the sidewalk. I love their breakfast menu. I've never gotten passed it and looked to their lunch menu. I just can't get enough of their three egg omelette with cheesy grits. Their menu is not overwhelming either. Just enough variety for you to make it your regular spot in no time. The staff is friendly and accommodating just as long as you are the same. I've always felt well taken care of by them. Overall I give this place 5 stars. Their food is delicious, affordable, and although I could do without the line, the experience when you finally get in is worth every minute. Pros: Good for breakfast Nice place to show off to out-of-towners Food is deicious Service is friendly Cons: Long wait (but it's worth it) Small establishment so it'll be hard for large parties seating more than 6, but not impossible. Location is in the tenderloin. Tip: I recommend dropping someone off to sign up on the waiting list while someone looks for parking.

Brenda is serving up some mean soul food here at this local hot-spot in SF.  The wait was incredible, seeing as how we had such a large party and a few late comers, but the food was WELL worth the price of admission. Beignets, beignets, beignets!!!  EVERYONE at the table was expecting little tasty bites of sweet and savory selections having grabbed 3 flights to taste each morsel. None of us knew we were going to get softball size delectables. Wow!  I mean these things were HUGE and we were right to grab each flavor as they were all wonderful.  Granted the plain beignet was a bit dull after having all of the other 3 flavors, but still worth it with Brenda's strawberry preserves on the table in front of us. I opted out of the huge meal knowing that I was going to get a taste of everyone's meal.  the biscuits are to die for, so I ordered that and their country sausage gravy.  Good stuff, but probably not the most flavorful I've experienced... probably why it's not a staple on their menu.  The fried green tomatoes were a nice touch the specials of the day.  The eggs benedicts were flowing throughout the restaurant with fluffy white eggs and creamy centers surfacing all over the table.  Brenda is not shy of her sauce - let me just say that. I believe everyone quickly forgot about the wait and had a pleasant time drinking mimosas and sipping coffee while staring at soon-to-be-empty plates.  thanks for doing us right Brenda!

Matt and I arrived on a Saturday morning around 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. The line wasn't that long and we were seated within 15 minutes. Waters and menus were provided right away. If you order sweet tea, the wait staff will refill your drink without even asking. No charge. And you really should try the watermelon house sweet tea. It is delicious! Shrimp and grits. It comes in a very large bowl. Delicious! Can feel a bit heavy and creamy after several bites. My husband and I couldn't finish it together. Gumbo. More savory and less heavy feeling than the grits. Beignets! Their beignets are incredible. They have a number to choose from with delicious fillings. Matt and I shared the shrimp beignets which came as three large puffed pastries - not what I'm used to. Incredibly tasty and quite filling. We each had one and took the third to go. Over all very impressive and incredibly satisfying even if a bit heavy.

Went for brunch at Brenda's with my mom and sister around 11am on a Wednesday morning, we arrived and there were 8 small parties ahead of us! Surprisingly we waited no more than 10 minutes, that's pretty impressive already! From what I hear, Brenda's recently remodeled, and there is much more space for tables than there used to be. We all ordered three entrees and shared with one another: Shrimp and Grits -- Sautéed shrimp, cheddar grits, spicy tomato-bacon gravy. Andouille Chicken Jambalaya - Chicken Andouille Sausages with Rice, served with a side house salad. Creole Veggie Omelet + Bacon -- Corn maque choux, tomato, onion, bell pepper, spinach, cheddar, bacon (how ironic). Brenda's is known for their Shrimp and Grits, this dish is extremely filling, but the flavors were amazing. The melted cheddar on top of the grits is mouthwatering, and the shrimp is perfectly seasoned and cooked. I really enjoyed the other dishes as well. The Jambalaya was really flavorful. The Creole Veggie Omelet was really well made, my mom wanted to order something lighter on the menu, and we thought that this was a very suitable choice for her. Overall we were really impressed with the quick service and the quality of the food here at Brenda's it definitely lived up to the hype.

Warning: Brenda's serve Brunch menu til 3pm and starts serving dinner menu at 5pm. I didn't know this information beforehand so my review is solely based on their brunch menu. I've always wanted to go to Brenda's ever since I saw a friend of mine post some food pics from Brenda's on fb. Then I looked up Brenda's on yelp and I was in shock! Almost 3000 reviews and Brenda's had solid 4 stars! Last but not least, it was SOUL FOOD. With all that in mind, Brenda's easily became one of my must go location. After waiting for about a year, I finally made a trip to norcal to visit my college roomie and she was kind enough to take me to Brenda's. I was so stoked! Once we got there, we waited for about 25 mins for party of four. I was expecting to try some of their dinner platter but was bummed out when I realized they were only serving brunch menu when we were there. That's the reason for -1 star. Anyway, I ended up order a cup of gumbo, shrimp & grits, and crawfish beignet. My favorite dish was definitelyyy the crawfish beignet! Ohmygod, it's so good. It's a savory beignet with oozing cheese inside with some scallions and little bits of crawfish. The beignet has dusted paprika seasoning around the surface and it enhanced the flavor. I think I would easily eat 2 beignets next time hah Shrimp & grits was also great! It gets heavy towards the end of the meal because of all the cheese but flavor wise it's so good. It was my first time trying grits but it wasn't bad at all! Think of porridge but the grit is a lot smaller than a rice grain so you can hardly taste the mushyness. Oh and the shrimp in the gritz is so good! It's seasoned well that I wish I can order a plate of their seasoned shrimp separately. Gumbo had bits of okra and andouille sausage so it was tasty. Brenda's Gumbo definitely tasted like traditional gumbo and it was like a comfort food to me. Nice warm soupy-rice dish with good flavoring can never go wrong! All in all, I was satisfied with my trip to Brenda's but next time I'll go during their dinner menu. :)

After a very disappointing dinner on my first night in San Francisco, I was starting to lose my faith in San Fran as a foodie town.  Then we came upon Brenda's for breakfast on our sight seeing trek.  San Fran you have redeemed yourself! Brenda's definitely does not disappoint.  We came here on a weekday so there wasn't a wait.  They start you off with a BIG cup of coffee, which I loved.  We ordered the shrimp and grits, grillades and grits, and the beignet flight to go.  If you want a typical breakfast then this definitely isn't the place to come.  The food was one of the best that we've had.  It was delicious!  The beignet are definitely something you order.  We tried the catfish right after and it was crispy on the outside, with the filling that was nice and hot.  Melts in your mouth good.  The other ones we had later in the afternoon but they were still good while they were cold.   I am definitely a fan and I would go back to Brenda's on my next trip to San Francisco.

Loved, loved, loved this place. We came in early on a weekday and avoided any kind of wait. The whole menu is brimming with great choices, but we stuck with the Yelp recommendations in the end. And despite being busy our server was very nice and prompt with our dishes and refills. We got some Watermelon Iced Tea, which is awesome, and started with the Beignet Flight. They were all good; even the plain is tasty with their homemade strawberry jam. But my fav was the Crawfish, hands down. Spicy, cheesy, crawfishy. It was dynamite. We got the Hangtown Fry with grits and a big-ass biscuit, a hot link a la carte, and the Sweet Potato pancakes. The Fry was a delicious scramble of fried oysters, bacon and eggs, and the pancakes were smothered in pecans and syrup. We definitely over-ordered and took most to-go, but I would eaten all of it and more if I could (and I would've if my gf didn't stop me). Why, oh why, did I fill up on the unlimited Watermelon Iced Tea?!

Great tasting, artery clogging, "i like my greens doused in butter",  comfort food at a fairly reasonable price? Count me in! I got the shrimp po-boy sandwich was fantastic. Piled high with fried shrimp, tomatoe, lettuce, and topped off with special sauce on a toasted buttered roll, what more could I ask for? Definitely one of the best po-boys I've had. Next time I'll be back to try the fried chicken. One oddity I noticed was that there are no men's restrooms, only a unisex and womens bathroom.

I have to thank Yelp members for detailing their experiences here.  Everything was delicious and the service is outstanding!  I was fortunate enough to go here a little after 5 o'clock PM on a weekday but I can only imagine how busy they get on the weekends.   To follow up on what everyone else has already said, the crawfish beignets are 'to die for'. Our table also had fried green tomatoes but they were not nearly as satisfying as the beignets. I could see myself returning for those alone! My main meal was the Catfish des Allemands (I tried to go for the healthiest thing on there.  Don't know if I quite succeeded.)  Cooked well, I must say.  Just a bit on the pricey side but everything there is pricey.  You get what you pay for and you definitely get a meal worth remembering and worth visiting again.

I came here with great expectations!!!! I ordered Brenda's (Not So Seasoned) Fried Chicken. You get a leg, wing, and half breast, a side of Collard Greens, and a biscuit. The biscuit and collard greens were nothing short of amazing...the chicken was juicy just not highly seasoned. Ambiance is decent, it's a fun casual environment. I went on a Friday evening. I'd go again but would do a different dish!!

Oh. My. God. Best breakfast ever. This place has forever ruined breakfast joints for me. Wherever else I go, it's always "Not as good as Brenda's". Where to start? Their Grits are the the perfect thing to start off a cold SF morning. Perfect texture and flavor! Their biscuits are super fluffy on the inside and nice and crusty on the outside. They always break apart perfectly in the middle so you can add generous amounts of their amazing jam/preserves. I tried the peach one and LOVED IT and I usually HATE peaches! The dish I usually get is the Grillades and Grits. Ohmygod... The beef is ridiculously tender and flavorful! It makes me want to cry! Also, if their seems to be 3 or more people in our party, I'll pressure everyone into ordering the Beignet Flight. It comes with a plain, a chocolate, a Granny Smith apple and a crawfish beignet. I usually try to take the crawfish beignet all to myself! BTW, my friend and his girlfriend ALWAYS order the Hangtown fry and share it between the two of them.  It's pretty damned big and he says you can't take a bite without getting some fried oyster in there! Sounds tasty but I'm addicted to those Grillades and Grits!

My fiance and I were visiting from Seattle, WA for my 30th Birthday weekend and we found this restaurant near where we were staying. We came to this place last Friday during brunch and just a warning, it is very very busy. We loved the chalkboard idea of writing your name and letting the servers/hostess cross off names as they seat people. It has high visibility and people don't get fussy on why the other party was sat before them. The waiting area is very very small, which is a negative especially if the restaurant is super busy. We had to wait around the doorway, which is unpleasant because you're in the way of other people, but there is no where else to go. Especially if it's raining outside, which was our case. The hostess was super rude to us as well. She screamed at us for being in the way, but it wasn't our fault or anyone else She could have at least said it nicer. We saw that a party of four, who came after us, were sat before us. Their name was clearly after us and we had two people in our party, versus their four people. I didn't understand why they got to be seated prior to us. We were up next and there weren't that many people who were in line after us, so they would have had their chance soon. I used to be a hostess trainer in my college days, so I would have known better. We didn't complain because we thought the food will make up for the crappy start. We were finally sat down and we ordered the shrimp and grits and the hangtown fry with a biscuit and hash. I ordered the watermelon iced tea with my meal and it was amazing. Free refills as well, which was great! We received our food and as soon as we tasted it, we needed basic seasoning like salt and pepper, which we were very very surprised about. We went to New Orleans this past March and had the real deal down there, and NEVER did we have to season our food. It wasn't even spicy, but they did supply hot sauce for that. For something to be called creole, I would expect it to be a little under average spice, especially for a city as diverse as San Francisco. The atmosphere of the place is casual. We loved the decorations of the mirrors everywhere. Our server was super nice and made up for the nasty hostess that we encountered earlier. I would recommend trying this place once, maybe the chef was having issues on our day. Not sure if we are going to come back, maybe one more time to give it another go.

There was so much buzz about this place on Yelp that my friend and I decided we had to come here. We were staying in the city for a night not too far away. She was hungover, so we walked hurriedly through the dirty and smelly part of the Tenderloin to get here. We walked in and put our name on the blackboard. The guy at the desk said it was going to take about 40 minutes, so we walked around the corner to Philz Coffee since she was thirsty. We saw someone else walk out with a cup, so we checked Yelp and were excited to see it was a short walk away. The trash can outside the joint had a ton of coffee cups in it, figures... When we came back, we saw the board had been erased, so we asked the guy about it and he said they probably called our name already. He gave us an unkind look and told us to put our name back on the board. That's when I noticed the sign that said "no outside drinks." Geez, no need to be stuck up about it; it was a roughly 40 minute wait and we were back before 40 minutes were up. While we were waiting, we decided what to order so we could put in an order immediately. When we were seated, we got the menus and the person walked away. Our waitress came to take our order within a couple minutes. +Watermelon sweet tea: so refreshing and delicious. I love sweet tea, but watermelon sweet tea is even better! Perfect for summer! +Crawfish beignets: I kind of wanted to try each flavor, but they're known for their crawfish ones, so we went with this. Wow, they're huge! Definitely go with a group of 2-3 people to share these. These are amazing though, but spicy! There's a lot of paprika on the outside, so just make sure not to inhale as you're eating (and choke). I've never had authentic beignets...but I'll just say that these weren't fluffy on the inside like I expected. It was kind of like a shell. We ordered two dishes to share, so we started just taking out the stuffing to eat. +Hangtown Fry: I was wondering what "crispy oyster" would be...It seems they dipped it in a batter and fried it before putting it into the scramble. SO GOOD! Yum! Get the grits and biscuit with this. The grits were smooth and creamy (butter?); I liked it. The biscuit had a light crunch on the outside and was fluffy on the inside; add the butter on top and you're in heaven. -Small location: when people with strollers were coming through, people had to suck in their guts and move their seats in to let people through. I can't wait to come back to try other items on the menu!

Love the food, the ambience and the 15 mins wait was not too bad for a table for two on one Saturday at 12pm. Really enjoyed crawfish beignet, watermelon iced tea and hangtown fry. (Note: to get a good impression, please do not miss those) We don't know which beignet to order, so decided to start with beignet flight, which is a mixed of everything. For entree, we ordered hangtown fry and catfish eggs benedict. Beignet flight comes in four pieces. The crawfish beignet is a must try; it's so good. I don't really like the chocolate one, the bread is too thick. Took the rest togo and haven't tried them yet. I will order just the crawfish next time...decided! Hangtown fry, fried oysters in scramble egg, is to die for. Oysters were cooked perfectly with some crunchy from the batter. Well, what could go wrong with fried oyster, scramble eggs and bacon!? Enough for the review, writing this makes me hungry again. Bon appetite!

OH MAHH GAWDDD. BEST OYSTERS OF MY LIFE. BUT be wary.. there's ALWAYS a wait here.. Like I said, GET THE OYSTERS.. ALL VARIETIES if possible.. my personal favorite was the casino, although a few of my friends liked the voodoo the most (a little too much bbq sauce for me) Brenda's is also known for their Po-boys... Both the shrimp and oyster po-boys were fresh and well-prepared... can't go wrong with either! I'm not much of a beignet person so I can't fairly rate their beignets but I thought they were just alright... OVERALL come here for the broiled oysters!

Came back! And I have to write another review! Super packed on Wednesday for lunch. Everyone is experiencing summer break and want to celebrate it with a little Brenda's. So first things first: doubting the orange juice. It's $2 ish and doesn't taste fresh squeezed. It tastes like it's from the carton. To be fair, it never said it was fresh squeezed, but it was kind of a mild (but ok tasting) let down. We were just glad that it wasn't Sunny D... right? Chicken etouffée really hits the spot! Such tender and flavor packed pieces of chicken! And it's spicy and tomatoey! Prior to this I wanted some chicken tikka masala, but this is a really good substitute. Half portion seems to be filling enough. Especially with a biscuit! Which is absolutely the most amazing biscuit I had ever eaten! It's a little on the sweeter side, but treat it like the delicate creation it is and shove it in your mouth with some of the etouffée. Or whatever else. Split a Creole Veggie Omelette. Chock full of cheddar cheese. I'm sure there were vegetables in there. Not sure. I just remember lots and lots of cheese. The potatoes it came with were not bad. They seem slightly smashed while they were fried, but SO GOOD. Oh yea. For those on a diet: this place is definitely not for you. I even heard the waitress say that even the water has calories here! Hahahaha!

This review is based entirely on brunch: It's the Beignet Flight, that included a crawfish version, that leads me to believe that their dinner would be incredible.  It was the only notable part of the meal but what a note it hit!   The Croque Monsieur (baked ham & gruyère with béchamel sauce on sourdough) was surprisingly bland.  I had to get a side of grits, considering it's a soul food joint, although I have never really been a fan.  These changed my opinion, causing me to look at grits in a whole new light.  I would have never guessed they could taste so good! The line moves way faster than I ever expected but when you're hungry it seems to take FOREVER.  I won't be able to check Brenda's off my list of things to try until I stop by again for dinner.  I've already ogled the menu and can't decide where to start!

I'm not sure how much value this review can add to a place with 2753 reviews and counting, but here it is: -Love the watermelon tea -Love the shrimp and grits (shrimp cooked perfectly, carmelized onions, slight sweetness/tang in the sauce, bacon!, and porridge-y grits) -Love shrimp&oyster po-boy (although next time I'd probably just get shrimp or try the catfish, especially right after eating at swan oyster.. yes, we had two lunches) -Love the crawfish beignets, skip the others!! -Love the interior walls and decor -Love being able to take Monday off and come in with very little wait!

Just had a crawfish Beignet from a coworker. A hint of spice on top, but the crawfish inside was pretty good. If I was not a nice person, I would not have shared it with my coworkers. Unfortunately, he came by and devoured it like theres no tomorrow. I would have to give this place a better review once I dine in. Meanwhile, based on the crawfish beignet, Id give it a 4 *

The process of choosing Brenda's: I've seen friends' mouth watering pictures of their food on FB, we were in the area, and she wanted something different. So it was set. The atmosphere was chill and relaxing. It was bright, not too loud, and the servers were polite and helpful. The crawfish beignets really stood out from the rest of the dishes. The outside was crispy, the inside was soft, and the filling was savory. So very delicious. The shrimp and grits was cheesy and I kinda wish I saved some of my beignet to dip in it. Our main dish was the ribs, mac n cheese and greens which was good but not great. I think we were still blown away by the beignets! The surroundings to this great restaurant were pretty shady and they don't let you share their watermelon iced tea (since it's all you drink, everyone needs to get an order). But I enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and esp the company that day and I'll be coming back if I'm ever in the area again.

It is sooo good here!!! Where to start?! First I heard the wait can be at times pretty long, but we called in to see how long was the wait at the moment and they said 30 minutes, so we rushed over quickly and didn't have to wait to long. This is a great place for brunch. My group ordered the beignet flights, and the best one was the crayfish beignet! The others were still good, but you much try the crayfish when you come here! I also ordered their special Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict with a mimosa. It was GOOD!!! I couldn't finish it but took it home to finish laters and oh my gosh, still good! Definitely be back for sure!!!

I was very happy with my experience at Brenda's.  I'm sure that people have the timing down to a science, but my two cents is that if you have a party of 3 at around 11am on a Saturday morning, you'll have to wait about 35 minutes (not bad, right?). For those of us who have been to and love New Orleans, it's great to experience a lovely place like this, on the West Coast (but unsurprisingly in SF :-), cooking up genuine bayou cuisine. Had a wonderful meal here.  I shared the beignet sampler, which included a crawfish beignet (don't knock it till you've tried it), as well as some cheese grits and gumbo.  Oh yes, then my entree came, which was a typical cajun stir-fried omelette, featuring scallions and oysters, with some potatoes and I drank the chicory coffee to wash it all down. Worth the wait, definitely. PS  Lovely, lovely, bright decor.

This place deserves 5 stars alone for the Beignet Flight. You must order it if you come here. We just had four donuts for breakfast before coming here and we still ordered it and it was amazing (don't judge me, I was on vacation). This is the best $9 you could ever hope to spend on a food item, especially in a trendy hipstery brunch spot. With the Beignet Flight you get 4 massive piping hot fried beignets, one of each of the 4 flavors they offer: plain, granny smith apple, chocolate and crawfish (they were nice enough to let me substitute an additional chocolate in place of the crawfish since I'm allergic to shellfish). The plain is ok (how bad could hot fried dough be?), but the apple and especially the chocolate, which are filled generously with hot melted ghirardelli chocolate, are amazing. Since we saw how huge the beignets were from other people ordering, we only got one other dish to share, the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken). The chicken was excellent and really juicy. It wasn't nearly as greasy as the fried chicken at a lot of other places, which was actually a welcome change after all of the fried beignets. The biscuit it comes with was really good - nice and buttery and very flavorful. The fries were of the fancy McDonald's variety and were pretty good. Lastly, it also comes with cole slaw, which was nice and refreshing and not too mayo-y. The wait wasn't even too long either. We went on a Friday at around 11 AM and we only waited around 10 minutes. The service was nice and attentive too. Also, though it is in the heart of the Tenderloin, it's not as bad coming here during the day for brunch since the homeless and the crackheads are still asleep. Definitely well worth the trip for an excellent meal.

I have been wanting to come here for the last two years but it never happened until yesterday! I always imagined this place as a hole in the wall but it is actually very modern, clean, and well lit. I love it. I can see why hipsters love it. It is nice but not too over the top. I knew it was popular so I made it a point that my boyfriend and I get here before the crowds. We arrived around 6ish on a Friday and were seated pretty much immediately. We ordered the: Sweet Watermelon House Tea $2.75 - We just got one since my boyfriend had to take Bart later. Bart doesn't have bathrooms. I didn't like it but flavored teas are not my cup of teas. (Pun intended) My boyfriend loved it and it was actually perfect that we ordered one cause they refilled it! I didn't expect that! Crawfish Beignets    2.75 each (Spiced with cayenne, scallions & cheddar) - Can you say delicious! They are also very big so if you can't eat much or ordering a lot of food I say you share. Overall, I have to say they are close to perfection. They used a bit too much Cajun powder on top. I had to scrape some of it off. Once I did that it was perfect. I can come and just eat these beignets and be a happy camper. Catfish des Allemands     16.75 (Bronzed catfish, crawfish étouffée, pecan rice pilaf ) - OMG! The catfish was cooked to perfection! I don't like fish but I kept picking at my boyfriend's dish. The catfish was so soft and tender but still had the crisp texture of the seared surface. Absolutely amazing! I want to get this next time! Chicken, andouille sausage jambalaya (comes with side salad) - I ordered this off the special menu and it was a huge let down. It is pretty much rice with pieces of chicken and sausage in it with a not special salad next to it.   The service here is great. AND I felt that everyone at this restaurant are friendly and open. I love the atmosphere and definitely want to come back especially to try their brunch items.

Butter makes everything better. From the grits to the biscuits to the saucy filling of the crawfish beignets, there's a lot of butter in Brenda's food. I tried the crawfish beignets, shrimp & grits, and the fried catfish eggs benedict during Sunday brunch. Each dish was executed perfectly. I can easily overlook the fact that my dining experience (55 min.) was shorter than how long I waited to get into the restaurant (1 hr, 10 min.) considering how friggin good the food is here. The crawfish beignets were like big ol' piroshkis with hunks of mudbug meat. The shrimp & grits was a plate of cheesy homeyness with acidic bits of tomato and sweet shrimp. The benedict had a beautifully poached egg and some tasty crunchy catfish atop a buttery biscuit. My only notes would be that because of the butter, the grits aren't your traditional kind. I actually prefer grits less buttery with dashes of tabasco. Also, the shrimp & grits plate can become a little monotonous because of the cheesiness and the grits. But I found it difficult to finish the plate anyways so you'll likely have leftovers for later. Also, I tried the sweet watermelon house tea which simply, didn't knock my socks off. Tips: - Come on a Sunday bc meters are free. However, I hear starting next year, meters will start running on Sundays so hurry up and get to Brenda's now!! - If you're driving to Brenda's, drive by the restaurant. Even though there's tons of people waiting outside, I noticed there were vacant spots right in front that drivers overlooked. -  Put your name on the board and then walk over to Van Ness to get some Philz while you wait. - The entire Brenda's experience was just over 2 hours for my bf and me. If you're going to Brenda's you'll need to block out that much time in your day, maybe 3-4 hours for bigger groups. - Make a friend in the area. If you're planning on going to Brenda's, ask your friend to put your name on the board ahead of time and by the time you get to Brenda's, your anticipated wait time will be shortened or completely eliminated.

This was my first experience of "soul food", and let me tell you, it was GREAT. Scrumptious. Delicious. Can't wait to go back for more. I took the Bart to San Francisco just for this, so even though the tickets were expensive (~$10 roundtrip), it was worth every penny. I ordered Shrimp & Grits, and my friend ordered the crawfish. The shrimp & grits were super flavorful, with bits of tomatoes, bacon, and sausage (??), plus plenty of shrimp! It doesnt look like a big portion but I could only finish half of it. As for the crawfish, it was really good as well (I took a bite out of my friend's food =D). The fish is crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside. It's topped with some veggies and thousand island sauce. The dish also comes with your choice of coleslaw or fries, but our waitress was nice enough to get us half and half. There were so many items on the menu, I'm definitely coming back for me! Also dying to try the watermelon tea. Oh! I went on a random Tuesday lunch and I still waited 15-20minutes, so I imagine this place would be packed on a weekend brunch.

Love, love, love the crawfish beignet! Must get item here!! I also tried the fried chicken which has great flavor, and the Croque Monsieur which was too heavy for me... WAY TOO MUCH cheese.

Overall, I really enjoyed this place and their food despise the long line. The service was very friendly and their dishes were delicious. The cool thing is they have a big menu. Therefore, it makes me want to come back and experience more of their dishes in the future. As for the dishes I had, their eggs benedict and sweet watermelon iced tea was really good. Highly recommend. If you want to read the rest of my review and experience go to my food blog entry. http://foodcreatespoop.w…

We decided to stop here because Swan Oyster Depot had a long line and what a surprise... this restaurant was pretty dam good. Shrimp and Grits was delicious but I cannot finish that myself, it would be better if it was two people sharing because it gets very nasty if you keep eating alot of cheese, 3 in my opinion would work too. Beignets were good (Crawfish was the best in my opinion) but there is alot of carbs on the bread. Watermelon iced tea was refreshing.

Simply put, I wish Brenda was my grandma.  I know I'll probably be 15lbs heavier if this were true, but her food is absolutely amazing. First off, I've heard that this place has a long wait, but we came early (6:15pm) so it worked out very well.  We wrote our name on the chalk board and were instantly seated. Secondly, get the Watermelon Iced Tea.  I'll say it again: get the Watermelon Iced Tea.  It's only $2.75 and you get FREE REFILLS. The three of us shared three entrees: 1. BFC - There was nothing wrong with the fried chicken, but what really stood out was Mac N Cheese that came along with it.  I don't even want to think about how many sticks of butter went into that thing, but I can tell you that it simply melts in your mouth, and it gives you that "Oh-face" going on (you know what I'm talking about). 2. BBQ Pork Ribs - For those of you who are unsure of what to order, I would recommend this.  Cheaper than the BFC, and much tastier in my opinion.  The pork ribs were amazing.  It was so soft I didn't need a knife to get the meat.  This was a very impressive dish, and the southern flavors really nicely with the BBQ aspect of the meal.  Seal of approval. 3. Catfish Po'Boy - Another great dish from Brenda. I don't know how you do it Brenda, but your chipotle rémoulade sauce that smothered the fried catfish was seriously to die for.  Buttery, tangy, and salty -  a very dangerious but delicious combination I must say.  Although I thought the catfish was a little undercooked, my friends thought this was the best dish out of the three.  I would definitely recommend this. All the amazing food here made me wish I were a professional food critic, hence my first yelp post.  On top of this, we all went home to watch Pixar's Ratatouillle for more French delights.  Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be coming here again.

Beignets = still good.   We got the sampler.  I remember the crawfish ones being awesome but my friend hadn't been here before, so we got the flight of beignets. I wanted the crispy pork belly but I am not a fan of grits.  D'oh.  I have their Croque Monsieur and my friend had the beans and rice-oh-so-nice!  Croque Monsieur was delicious with perfect, crisp french fries (or you could get cole slaw).  And the beans and rice--omg, delicious, and it has a large piece of andouille sausage too. I also tried the watermelon sweet tea--which was not that sweet and deliciously 'watered' down by the watermelon.  :)  It's worth a try!   Apparently, they've expanded their area since the last time I was here (which was over 4 years ago now).  And there is more seating that I remembered!  Woohoo.   They have a chalkboard for you to sign up on...and as if I needed further proof that I cannot write in a straight line, I wrote my name in chalk as it was skewing upwards.   They will NOT seat you until your WHOLE party is there, so don't even think about 'saving' seats!   Service = okay.  They get pretty busy in here, and attention is hard to get.   Prices = reasonable to moderate.  It was a $20.00 per person lunch, for the two of us.  Two drinks, beignets flight and two entrees, plus tax and tip.  It wasn't too bad but I wouldn't do this too often.   If you come during say noon on the dot, or brunch hours on the weekends, expect to wait, and wait for a table!

hmmmm where should I start.... Good ambiance, Great concept.........just OK food. Went for dinner on a thursday night. But wait I'm a bit biased: I spent 4 years in college in Louisiana (cajun country). So, here's the problem with most "cajun/creole" inspired restaurants in the bay area, they simply would not make the cut in Louisiana. Sprinkling food with cayenne pepper or cajun spices is not enough to call something cajun. Okay now back to Brenda's: Good food but I was expecting more from such a highly rated YELP spot. Good spot if you are just wanting a quick, fulfilling bite. ' Maybe I'll try brunch next time ;_)

Awesome awesome awesome. It was my second time to Brenda's and it was even better than I remember. I ordered the catfish on a salad. We had beignets for the table. My SO had an omelet. The community coffee from New Orleans was perfect. We went on a weekday late morning, so there was no line. I imagine that it could get busy and packed. I don't love the neighborhood that it's in - or I should say, the walk from the hotel to Brenda's isn't great. We opted for a cab, something we never do in SF since we usually walk or use public transport. Anyway, well worth the cab fare. Service was prompt and friendly and the food was outstanding. Nothing more to say really - oh, one tip. When you walk in, write your name on the chalkboard to save your place in the queue.

Love the food here! We got the beignet flight - crawfish, chocolate and plain.  All were good but especially liked the crawfish and chocolate ones. I ordered the oyster po'boy and it was so good!  Hubby ordered the chicken which was moist and flavorful. Watermelon tea was refreshing!

We went there for brunch on a Saturday. Be warned, the wait is long, but oh so well worth it. You have to put your name down on the chalk board, and they will go down the list as tables become available. We had to wait almost an hour to get in. Try the shrimp and grits, it was delicious. The coffee is also good. The portions are pretty big, but make sure you save some room for the beignets - you'll be glad you did.  We had a look at some of the other items people ordered around us and the french toast and eggs benedict also looked very good. We will be back to try these as well.

Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning after it was highly recommended by a girlfriend. Walk in, put your name on the chalkboard list with the number of people in your party. Then be patient! We had a party of 6 and waited a little under an hour to be seated, which seems quick as the standard wait here is longer. Brenda's food was so good for my soul, so bad for my diet. Very satisfying. The service here was a bit unfriendly, but it was attentive. **Beignet flight--- (Original/Chocolate/Apple/Crawfish) These are huge and very hearty. Good for sharing. The crawfish beignets are savory, creamy and rich with a dusting of paprika seasoning on top. The others are dusted with powdered sugar on top and are very sweet. The apple was my favorite. ** Gumbo--- Huge chunks of chicken, sausage and okra. Simple and good. I really liked it. ** Shrimp n Grits--- So savory, creamy and flavorful. Topped with mildly spicy tomato-bacon sauce and melted cheese. Melt in your mouth delicious. ** Croque Monsieur---  Baked ham and gruyère topped with béchamel sauce on sourdough. This was too rich and salty for my taste. Try their homemade strawberry jam, its delicious!

Brunch or dinner, this is one of my favorite places to eat in the city and I'm not surprised that it has so many other great reviews. I'm not a huge fan of the South and because of the great food here, I don't have to go there to experience the amazing soul food that is embodied by Brenda! I can't even write about anything specific because I've had almost everything on the menu and loved everything I've ever ordered. While it really pulls in crowds for brunch (I live walking distance from Brenda's so prefer to do take-out when I want a Brenda's brunch), this is secretly a great and lesser-known spot for a nighttime meal. The first time I went for dinner (after a few previous brunch outings), I was pleasantly surprised at the very short wait time and while I wouldn't classify the ambiance as "romantic," it was definitely a great dinner date with my boyfriend. My friends make fun of me because I rave about Brenda's so much but I do it for a reason and am now raving about it on Yelp! Seriously, GO HERE.

Watermelon sweet tea. Beignet platter. Crispy pork & cheesy grits. Sweet potato pancakes with pecan maple syrup. Oh Brenda, can you be my neighbor? What an indulgence! Though my waistline hated me for this meal, it was well worth it. The watermelon sweet tea is so good, I would drink it all day long if I could. The beignet platter is ginormous. It's basically a meal in itself! The catfish one is cheesy heaven and has a good kick to it. I liked it. The apple one was average. I didn't try the chocolate. And I really enjoyed the original. The crispy pork & cheesy grits was my favorite dish. The pork is indeed crispy, fatty and meaty all at the same time. Perfect amount of cheese in the grits. The sweet potato pancakes were delicious, but reminded me more of a dessert. It was quite sweet and I imagined it tasting exponentially better with some vanilla bean ice cream on top. Everything we tried was great!

Went here for our third year anniversary for dinner. Not sure how this place has four stars maybe they have great breakfast/brunch? First it's on a sketchy block, I was afraid for my car. Second, let's review the food. Beer recommended by waitress was great Crawfish beignets - not great - filling not tasty Hushpuppies - not great Oysters - she loved them Shrimp po boy - not great- average plain fries Catfish entree - tasty - cornbread dressing - not great - sauteed vegetables - tasty breadpudding - good but way to sweet chocolate pot de creme - tasty until i found MOLD in the container...ewwwwww...needless to say this was taken off the bill.. Third, all the staff was awesome...and the interior / music was nice too All together it was not worth the almost $80 bill......won't be back.....

We come from the south and were on vacation in San Fran.  We discovered Brenda's as a search for best brunch places in San Fran and by you fellow yelpers.  Now, you gotta get here early just to make sure you get a seat early before the morning rush for brunch.  We were seated quickly and efficient.  I started off with the watermelon sweet tea which coming from Texas.... why the heck didnt we think of that?!?! super tasty and thought it was unique.   We got the beignets (get the flight so you can try it all) but if you love crawfish and want something different... OMG the crawfish beignets were YUM!  The choc one was great, so def a must have.   I got the hangtown fry since it was rec. by the people sitting next to us because I just couldnt make a decision bc everything looked great.  I would have done away with the potatoes or got the grits bc the potatoes were ehhh.   My friend got the eggs benedict with the pulled pork.  She thought it was heaven in her mouth.  Breakfast and a southern girl getting bbq for breakfast?  What else could you ask for!?! The biscuits were amazing and I wish I got the grits just to try but Im sure we will come back here again next time we're in San Fran.   Hey.. Brenda's... I gave you 4 stars because I wish you were in Texas...or else I wouldve given you 5! ;) 3,000 reviews.. what else do ya need! FYI, the people that have complained about the service... give them a break... theyre busy... and they help each other out.

I came the day of the Asian Heritage Street Celebration. Thank god it wasn't busy and they sat us right away.  Go early! 9:30am is a good time to go without having to wait, but if you go there 10-20 mins after, the wait gets long. I ordered the following: Crawfish Beignets    2.75 each Spiced with cayenne, scallions & cheddar: SOO GOOD! It was the best item I got that day. It was spicy and you could taste the crawfish. The dough on the beignet was also pretty awesome. Eat it all, I was sad that I didn't get to finish the ONE that I ordered. Grits was good. They forgot to give me my biscuit and it was also a bit overcooked which made it really dry. It was darker than the biscuit on the table next to me. Again, I am sad. Creole Seafood Frittata $12.95 Crawfish, Shrimp, ansoulle sausages, and cheddar: Hrm, I expected this to be pretty awesome, but I was disappointed. The smell was way off, as if something wasn't fresh or fully cooked. My bf said it smelled like mold. I realized that the shrimp was the thing that made the dish smell and taste bad. Hangtown Fry $11: This was really good. The oysters was cooked perfectly and it didn't give off a bad seafood smell like mine. I wish I could give this place more stars, but for the dish I got, I had to dock two stars. It was just bad BAD. My bf's dish and the beignets was really good.

I cannot believe it has taken me so long to write a review about this wonderful place. I've only been twice, but I must say, both times we're very satisfying. I came in with my family on a Sunday morning (if you're hungry, don't EVER come on a Sunday morning) and we had to wirte our name on a cool chalkboard and wait to be called. There is a small waiting area, which was already full, so we waited outside. It was one of those over-cast foggy San Francisco mornings, so that was not such a good idea. After dealing with the homeless, and other strange people; we were finally seated 2 hours later...yes, 2 HOURS later. We looked through the yummy menu, and I pretty much wanted to order everything (that's how hungry I was), but I decided on the Hangtown Fry, a yummy delicious breakfast scramble filled with eggs,  crispy oysters (my fave), and scallions. I also decided to try out the french toast. My son went for the Sweet Potato pancakes. Everything was delicious, I honestly have to say, I didnt expect anything less. The rest of my family ordered items such as beignets, shrimp and grits, and gumbo. We had so much food on the table...we just had a big sampling party, but I didnt let anyone touch my Hangtown Fry dish...that was just so different, and my stomach cried with joy with every bite I took. I honestly dont know when I'll be back, because I'm not to quick to wait 2 hours again, I think it was ridiculous to have to wait so long; hopefully they open another location. If you're reading this review...please try the HANGTOWN FRY, it's really delicious.

The food was okay but not worth an hour wait! I ordered the catfish eggs benedict and there wasn't enough catfish, too much biscuit, and the hollandaise sauce was too tart. The crawfish beignet was good and the orange juice is from a carton. I would say it's worth a try, but I will not be returning.

A very busy place. We went for lunch around 1pm. Service is so, so. Servers rush you to order and wait for food can be long. Aside from average service, food is a whole 'nother  story. Food is freshly made and piping hot! Beignet flight is a must! Crawfish etouffe beignets are amazing. All beignets are liberally stuffed with delicious fillings. Take advantage of the free refills on the fresh watermelon sweet tea! Will definitely go back to try their other items.

I guess I came here with high expectations, but I was seriously expecting better. The service was great/attentive, and my watermelon iced tea was constantly refilled. It was just the food that wasn't quite satisfactory. Amazingly, we were seated for dinner time right away. My boyfriend actually joked after dinner that maybe people rave about this place so much because they had to wait longer for seating, thus making them hungrier... Anyway, here's what we ordered: Oyster Flight - I actually liked this dish the most. The oysters were juicy and fresh, and the seasonings were different, but complimented it well. A bit pricey at $8.75 for three oysters, but eh, whatever. Crawfish Beignets - I can honestly say that these were what I was looking forward to the most. I love love love crawfish, and when I saw the pictures of the crawfish beignets here, I knew I had to have them. Beautifully presented as they were, my disappointment came after the first bite. It tasted nothing like I imagined (this is my fault, but just sayin'), and as another reviewer said, they basically tasted like an upscale hot pocket. BFC - Brenda's fried chicken. I thought this dish was OKAY. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't horrible either. Just meh. Shrimp Po-Boy - this was probably the second highlight of our dinner, after the oysters. The shrimp was super fresh and the breading wasn't overwhelming - plus the chipotle sauce they had over the shrimp was delicious. I was too full to finish the po-boy, but if I were to come here again, this would probably be the only thing I would order. Overall, not a bad place to try out, but definitely not at the top of my list for food.

To be honest, I really thought this place was decent. There aren't that many soul food places in the city, so coming here for brunch on a Sunday seemed like a pretty good idea. A place that is just "decent" plus a long frickin wait (we waited an entire hour) AND is also expensive to top it off doesn't rank too high in my list of 4 pluses..so I'm giving it 3 stars. For me, I really didn't like the sweet watermelon iced tea. I'm dipping into my southern roots and definitely saying that if you're selling tea as "sweet tea", it NEEDS to be sweeter. We Ordered: 1. Beignet Flight - These were good. The best ones were the plain ones and the crawfish. The apple one and the chocolate were kind of hard on the outside. I'm pretty sure they were burnt. Bad batch maybe? But I wasn't impressed with those.. I have to say that these beignets are very inconsistent. 2. I got the Fried catfisb benedict - this was really good! I'm a fan of fried AND love eggs benedict! Loved the perfectly poached egg, the soft/fluffy biscuits..they did a good job with this one. 3. Friends got the shrimp and grits -  VERY cheesy and flavorful. I liked this one muchmuch more than the Pork Belly grits. Not very much shrimp and it was very buttery grits with cheese melted on top. I like it, but would have stuck w/ my catfish benedict, only cuz i lovveeee hollandaise and biscuits.. :)

YUM! This is definitely comfort brunch food.. I could feel my stomach stretching after this butter-filled meal. The wait was long on the weekend.. but theres a peets coffee walking distance to wait at. The fried chicken , the biscuit, the soft scrambled eggs.. everything was made perfectly. We also had lunch here and their gumbo was tasty (although no where near new orleans level). Would definitely recommend this place for brunch over lunch.

Like most yelpers recommend, the crawfish beignets are the item to order.  The husband and I ordered one of each.  The apple tasted like mcdonald's apple pie.  The chocolate was like a donut with melted chocolate chips.  The original tasted like a donut with powdered sugar.  The crawfish was rich, cheesy, and slight spicy goodness.   I expected the dough to be more light and fluffy but it still tasted good with the crawfish.  I was nearly full after eating the beignets. We ordered special sweet potato pancakes that came with special syrup already poured on.. I would recommend you ask for the syrup on the side unless you like really sweet pancakes.  The pancakes tasted like a sweet potato pie but we could not finish it as we were pretty carb loaded already. The husband ordered the omelette that had the fried oysters and grits.  He said it tasted good.  The oysters were fried crisp and light.  Grits were seasoned well, probably with plenty of butter also.  I ordered the special pork belly and grits.  There was a ton of cheese on the grits.  At first it was cheesy heaven.  I love cheese so I was happy but then it seemed like I was eating cheese with grits towards then end instead of grits with cheese.  The pork belly was tender and flavorful.  The portion was large.

The food was pretty good.  The andouille sausage was some of the best I've ever had.  Perfectly seasoned, right amount of spice, heat, and smoke.  So good.  The apple beignets were good too...although gigantic...so beware you are getting a huge order.  Definitely couldn't finish them.  The biscuit was fantastic.  Dense and firm on the outside warm and moist on the inside.  I loved it. The potatoes weren't my favorite.  Flavorful but mushy, I like em crispy.  Not Brenda's fault though!  I will speak up next time. Service was frustrating which is why I'm having them at 3 stars right now.  It took forever to get our order in and we had to wait a long time for food to get out.  Not sure if that's the norm or not.  A little more server communication would have gone a long way.  I'll definitely be back though.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. Service was decent, ambiance was meh, prices were a bit high and food was good. We ordered: Gumbo -- nice flavors with big chunks of chicken, sausage, and okra ($7.25) Beignets sampler which were like donuts filled with a surprise ingredient ($9.50) Order of likabiltiy: Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions & cheddar -- DELICIOUS!! I was surprised by the burst of flavor from this excellent mix of ingredients Plain -- i was able to appreciate the texture of the dough and the slight sweetness which i couldnt taste with the others Granny Smith Apple, with cinnamon -- taste like apple pie   Molten Ghirardelli chocolate -- great for the chocolate lover but it was too sweet for me Hangtown Fry ($11) Oyster and bacon scramble -- lots of oysters, its pretty much all you could taste so it's good for seafood lovers.

Step in. Print  your name on the chalkboard on the right side wall inside the door. Write down how many in your party. Wait. Not for long. We felt lucky that there was only one name ahead of ours. We waited less than five minutes to be seated whereupon we received menus and our drink order taken. I'm going to upset a lot of people by suggesting that you not order the beignets. My reasoning is both personal and practical. I have to admit my experience with beignets is somewhat limited. I've only had them in a couple of places before, Cafe du Monde in New Orleans and  Angeline's in Berkeley. What we expected were four (we ordered the Beignet Flight) fluffy pillows of yummy deliciousness sitting atop a bowl of powdered sugar.. What we received were four humongous "cakes", three of which were covered in powdered sugar, the fourth (crawdad) had a different color powder on top. Were they good? Yes. Were they great? No. They were at least twice the size of beignets that we had had before. I think that if we had been sitting outside enjoying our cups of coffee and people watching, the beignets would have been a nice accompliment but as a breakfast item, way too heavy! Okay, that was the personal reason. Now the practical reason. The beignets are so filling, you can only one more dish to split less you want to be rolled out the door when you're done dining. From the special board, we got Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits and Onion Relish. These grits were so delicious, I could have scarfed down a bowl by myself. A light layer of cheese melted on top with the Pork Belly nestled up to a perfectly poached egg, onion relish with a kick dressing the pork. j Coffee was good. Service was good. They do a great job getting your order, serving, and turning the tables over. One miscue was that our coffee never got refilled. But they're pretty large cups to begin with. All in all, we'd go again.

My favorite place for brunch in the city. Must gets: Flight of beignets or really just an order of the crawfish beignets... It's like the best crawfish "hot pocket" ever, it's seriously bursting with flavor in every bite. Watermelon ice tea: trust me, you're going to need a tall glass of this refreshing drink after waiting in that super long line. Oyster Po'Boy: ridiculously good, perfectly seasoned and deep fried (I had you at deep fried, huh?) Pulled pork eggs benedict: enough said and most importantly, the carbs, the hash and creamy biscuits, so good. The only downside is the size of this place and the crazy long lines, but no worries the watermelon ice tea will restore your good humor.

Delicious. I knew the wait would be quite long so, I had a pre-brunch snack before heading over. There's Philz and Peet's nearby to help tide you over while you wait. Me and my friend showed up around 1:30 and waited about an hour to get seated. It was worth the wait. Ordered a beignet sampler - apple and crawfish were my favorites, fried chicken eggs benedict, and the hangtown fry. I think we managed to finish about 70% of the meal before calling it quits. We finished 100% of the beignets (best eaten fresh!) and saved the rest for a midnight snack.

After a long, arduous drive to San Francisco, we decided to dine here based on the Yelp reviews. As we walked into the dining establishment, we immediately put our names on the chalkboard. Needless to say, it took us an awful long time until we were seated. I believe we waited for almost 20 minutes as the restaurant was full. While waiting by the door, I noticed that the small interior of the restaurant was decorated by the plethora of mirrors. After what seemed ages, we were finally led to our seats. Now being new here, we certainly did not know what to order. From the hype surrounding this place, we didn't want to order poorly, so we asked the waiter for his recommendations. While talking to us, the waiter seemed occupied with the other patrons and thus, did not make eye contact while talking to us. The waiter soon left abruptly without giving us a coherent recommendation. I decided to dine on the "Kick-Ass Burger" for $9.75. From the menu, the burger consisted of 1/2 pound spiced up ground chuck with caramelized onion, bread & butter pickles, & with their own special sauce on toasted kaiser roll. This burger came with either a side of fries or coleslaw, along with their watermelon pickles. I ordered mine's medium-raw. For 9.75, I expected a performance in my mouth. However, much to my dismay, the first bite of my burger was incredibly salty. At first, I thought it was just me but then I took another bite, after first cleansing my palate with their sweet watermelon house tea. The second bite didn't fare any better. I gave my friends a sample for an unbiased opinion and they told me the same thing--it was salty. Not one to waste food, I tried my best to devour the entire burger, withstanding the barrage of brine-filled bites in order to finish it. Just to be fair, one of my friend ordered the same kick-ass burger and his was as salty as well. This rules out this being an isolated experience. The only thing redeeming in this establishment was probably the chocolate-filled beignet flights (chocolate filled pastry). It wasn't "out-of-this-world" good, but it did amend for the poor performance of the burger somewhat. Their watermelon house tea was 'okay' as well. With the amount of high reviews for Brenda's, I didn't expect anything majestic. I did, however, expect the food to be adequate. However, after dining here, I leave this place with a 1 star review, citing their poor customer service and their non-kick ass burger that was lacking in performance and tasted of the red sea...

I've never had grits before but now I'm a believer: the shrimp and grits is really good! Also had the pulled pork eggs benedict, pretty amazing too, but the hash on the side was kind of bland. I'm actually not a huge fan of the beignets... now I don't know what a beignet really tastes like because I've only had it here. I tried the dungeness crab beignet and the caramel apple, while the fillings are good I thought the pastry was a bit hard. I will definitely go back to try lunch and dinner.

Damn Brenda, I ran all the way from the Civic Center Bart station just for you (and 3 others who were sorta impatiently waiting for me. hah!)  But guuuurl, you've got your crawfish beignets down. Seriously so fulfilling and so flavorful.  I ordered the beignet flight and all were equally satisfying, and had to be enjoyed throughout the day because the crawfish got me full. Now if we weren't rushed for time and I weren't sweating from the quick run, I'd be down to stay a while and enjoy almost everything else on the menu.  But I'll be back. Save a seat for me.

I went on a Friday at 10:30 am. I beat the traffic, but we waited for a good 10 minutes. I am glad, it was worth that wait ;) We ordered the crawfish beignet (crawfish, with cayenne, scallions and cheddar) plus the shrimp & cheesy grits. YUM!!! It was tasty. We split the dishes, it was just enough.. plus got their watermelon iced tea (a ok and refreshing and free refills) and their community coffee (no bueno). The crawfish beignent I knew from the yelp reviews had not so much crawfish and I think it gave me a slight stomach ache :( but it was also kind of dry. Sad! But its a cute location w/ its chalkboard. I don't know if I'll come back if it's a longer wait than 10 minutes.. plus meter.. you know how it is. BUT they do give you change of $1 coins :)

So Brenda's is one of those "god damn't why is it in the tenderloin" restaurants that make me brave the crackheads to venture there. I will say the hush puppies are meh (too oily), but the rest of the food I've had is delicious. The Fried chicken has a great skin and the chicken inside is juicy and moist without being dried out like other fried chicken restaurants. The Shrimp Po Boy is damn good though it's a bit messy. The Beignets are damn good, they are freaking massive so I only recommend getting one, the chocolate wasn't that good but the crawfish are heavenly.

Crawfish and Apple and Chocolate, Oh My! Your Guide to a Successful Brenda's Brunch: Step 1: Get excited. Very excited. Step 2: Put your name on the list and be prepared for a 30-45 minute wait. This really isn't long when you compare it to other brunch places around the city. Step 3: ORDER THE BEIGNET FLIGHT. The crawfish is ahhhmazing, the chocolate is decadent, the apple tastes like pie, and the plain...well, I don't actually know, I didn't try it. Step 4: Order an entree with a biscuit and grits. Rave about how amazing it is. Eat off your friends plates as they eat off yours. Finish 1/3rd of the entree because you just can't eat anymore. Take the rest home. Enter into hard core food coma for the next several hours. Successful Brunch Complete. My Meal Breakdown: * Beignet Flight ($9.50). See Step 3 above for my beignet descriptions. For reference, they're pretty large - about the size of my fist. * The Egg and Bacon Tartine ($9.50). My favorite of our non-beignet dishes. The tomato relish on top was sweet, savory, and delicious. Comes with your choice of grits or home fries. Both are fantastic, though I think it's more rare to find good grits than good home fries. * Creole Seafood and Sausage Frittata Special ($12.50). Covered in cheese. filled with shrimp and other seafood, and served with a biscuit in addition to grits. As I've said, the biscuit and grits were AMAZING. Best I've ever had. Granted, I haven't eaten that much soul food in my life. * Fried Green Tomato and Bacon Benedict Special ($12.50), also served with grits or potatoes. Delicious, but prepare yourself for crazy rich hollandaise. Mmmm I can't wait to come back!

By far my FAVORITE brunch place in San Francisco. This place is phenomenal - I always walk away 5 lbs heavier - delectable fried chicken, crawfish and sweet beignets, po-boys. They are also on 7x7 top 100 things to eat in SF before you die (google it) - they always nail it.

My boyfriend's family were visiting  SF and we decided to go to Brenda's bright and early at 7:50 AM to beat the crowds for Sunday brunch. So was it worth it? Yes, yes, yes. I knew that I'd love the place the moment I walked in. It reminded me of one of my favorite places in Santa Barbara called the Palace and had that jazzy southern vibe. Up first: Beignet flight- chocolate, plain, apple, and crawfish. No complaints here. Each one of them were delicious. Here's a tip: Spread some of the fresh jam onto plain beignets. Yummy! Entrees: The boyfriend: Pork Belly with cheesy grits and tomato onion jam. The grits were cheesy to perfection. The Pork Belly had a good flavor, but it wasn't as tender as it should have been. Me: Eggs Benedict on cream biscuits with creole hollandaise hash and fried chicken. My boyfriend told me to order fried chicken with my dish and at first I was hesitant. I am very picky with my fried chicken. I am happy to say that Brenda's fried chicken was excellent. I am less happy to admit that my boyfriend was right. The creole hollandaise was the best hollandaise sauce that I've ever had.The homemade biscuits were fresh,buttery and crumbly. GET HERE EARLY GUYS. After you eat here, you will understand why it is so crowded!

Want my advice? Go for the flight of beignets. If you're in a group, get the biggest piece of the crawfish beignet. Trust me. Went in for brunch and ordered the special: pork belly with cheese grits and a poached egg, topped with a spicy tomato sauce and scallions. Sounds amazing, doesn't it? It tasted even better. There's always a painfully long line, but it's just SO worth it.

I always hear rave reviews about their brunch but my friend and I went here for dinner. we didnt even know Brenda's serves dinner until we were looking for a place to eat before Avicii concert at Bill Graham. Waited 5 mins and i do like the whole writing your name on the chalkboard. Very cute ambiance. love the wall of mirrors. The restaurant is semi big but also small. The waitress was kinda attentive. Only saw her in the beginning for our drinks and food but after our meal came i never saw her again. I thought she was kinda "snotty too especially since i asked if that was sangria on their counter and she just replied "uh..no, thats our watermelon drink." well how the HELL i'm suppose to know if this was my first time dining at Brendas?! hmm...ill let that go but she did it again when i requested a glass of pinot noir. she replied "pinot what?!" arghh..good thing i was already semi buzzed to let that go again. we ordered -- crawfish beignets -- ehh..it was okay. nothing special. but it was huge. one is perfect for two people. i thought it just taste like a chinese donut? burger with a fried egg - HUGE! was very good! love their coleslaw too! po boy - my friend thought it was okay but still very flavorable Will definitely come here again. maybe for brunch (i cant wait up early to just eat).

A friend and I visited Brenda's around 9 AM on a Saturday morning, and we did not have to wait to be seated. We ordered a flight of beignets to start, which were all quite good as the bread used to make it is very good. The crawfish one provides a unique flavor and style and was probably my favorite, followed by the chocolate one. We split an order of grits with pork belly and plum crumble pancakes (both specials that day), and both were really good. The pork was tender and went well with the grits, while the plum crumble pancakes was unique and was delicious, although I would have preferred my pancakes a little more compact and less soft. All in all, a really nice brunch experience (the layout of the restaurant is also nice), and I would definitely make a trip back here to try some of the other dishes.

Food: 5/5 - This is just my opinion,but breakfast/brunch here beats Mama's, Dottie's, or anywhere else in SF. Beignets (especially the savory crawfish one), biscuits, omelettes, scrambles, french toast, and the specials are ALL amazing. Service: 4/5 - Since it's a busy spot, the service is friendly but nothing to write home about. They are fairly efficient, so even though the wait in line may be long taking orders/getting food is fairly quick. Ambiance: 4/5 - It's a small space, but given the remodel it's gotten bigger, and though the neighborhood may not be the greatest, it's nice inside.   Value: 5/5 - Breakfast/brunch options are all under $15, and they are very filling so I'd say this is a good value for the price.

We were early to see "American Idiot" at the Orpheum and decided to grab a bite. Decided to give Brenda's a try since French Soul food sounded interesting. A fancier way to say Cajun/Creole food I guess. So the area is a little sketchy but this is a diamond in the rough. Total hipster vibe, loved the decor. Each of the walls are totally different and loved the big mural on the wall. It took a few minutes just to soak up the place.  The customers were all pretty young and cool. The food was really good as well. The hush puppies were great. The fried chicken was good though a tad dry. We ordered the beignets sampler plate for dessert. Coincidentally, they had a Cafe Du Monde coffee can on our table to hold the silverware.  I was hoping for beignets like what they serve at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans..powdery cloudy deliciousness. Unfortunately it was a disappointment and too thick for my liking. But still a solid 4 star restaurant and I am coming back. I heard later from a friend who lives in the neighborhood that they are famous for bunch and have a long wait.

Wonderful to have a spot for inexpensive, but good, food like you might find in the neighborhood back streets of New Orleans, or "Anywhere, Louisiana," for that matter. This was my 1st time here.  Having grown up in the South, I have a lifelong appreciation for -- and strong opinions about -- this kind of food.  Here's my take:   Collard greens - dictionary definition of excellent! Very flavorful, yet not too meaty or greasy. Cooked perfectly. Bravo! Shrimp with Grits - Delicious, but not excellent.  Too creamy, long stringy cheese, not enough texture of the grits. Grits for toddlers.  I want to know my food.  I want to feel the corn's texture, "to the tooth," not for it to hide unnoticed in its creamy, cheesy medium.  Nice flavors, though. Wine Glasses - Please lose the grade school juice glass filled to the rim. This is a cheesy (OK, pun intended) "because we're a 'homestyle' restaurant" affectation, and a way to conceal a mediocre wine's lack of aroma and flavor characteristics, but why do this? Serving even really fine wine this way ensures that it'll leave an impression of flavorless mediocrity because it suppresses any aroma and flavor characteristics the wine may have.  While "grown ups'" wine glassware would cost more, it would probably sell more 2nd glasses of wine. Overall, "Very Good," and I will return to try more dishes. But, perhaps I'll stick with beer next time.

I finally got to try this place after hearing it hyped up from other friends and I have to say, it wasn't that great. Keep in mind this is a review of our dinner there; supposedly brunch here is what the restaurant's known for. My friends and I went on last Friday evening and surprisingly, it wasn't that packed! There was a sign that stated that parties would not be seated until all members were present, which made us a bit nervous because one of our friends wouldn't arrive until 40 minutes later. However, we explained the situation to the hostess who was understanding of our situation and promptly seated us. We started off with the crawfish beignets which everyone on Yelp is raving about and while I liked what I tried, one of my friends complained about the bread to crawfish ratio. It did seem more doughy then meaty. For the entree, I had the jambalaya w/salad which was the special that night. My other friend had the catfish and two of my friends shared the jambalaya and ordered oysters. Let me start off by saying that my entree left me very full, which is always a plus, and I did feel as though I got my money's worth. My only complaint, however, is that it did seem a little salty. It wasn't overwhelming, but after several bites I did feel the urge the continuously drink water. The waitress also suggested sprinkling some of the hot sauce over it and I did, but I didn't think it really added anything special. I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but the ones my friends ordered looked delicious, so if you're a a fan of oysters, go for it! The catfish looked okay; it didn't look too special, to be honest. The wait staff were very friendly, but eventually one of my friends found it overbearing. Though I didn't feel the same, I could see why she thought that as we had two different people coming up to us several times to ask if everything was okay. It was a bit distracting after awhile. Overall, I enjoyed trying out Brenda's but it is a bit overhyped and I'm sure there are probably better soul food places in SF.

Came here on a Saturday night around 6pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes for seating for a party of 4. I tried the watermelon sweet tea, which was definitely yummy and had bits and pieces of watermelon, but you couldn't really taste the sweet tea. Nonetheless, still very refreshing. We shared the hush puppies appetizer. Pretty good, but dry without the sauce. I ordered the jambalaya special and loved it. Perfect sized portion and the green salad it came with was a great touch. The jambalaya was delicious and wasn't very spicy at all. We shared the Sweet Flight appetizer which came with one of each kind of beignets: plain, granny smith apple, and chocolate. The chocolate was by far my favorite. The combination of warm donut with gooey chocolate filling was a perfect end to the meal. As for service, the waitresses weren't exactly the friendliest, but were very prompt. We got our order taken and food brought out fairly quickly, but they were very short with us (hence 4 stars and not 5).

If a girl can't make it to the South to get some soul food, then at the very least someone can bring it up to the girl. I'm a girl on a budget (kind of) and so traveling to all the world's locations to try their native cuisine just isn't feasible. Luckily, Brenda's seems to have understood that and so brought the cuisine up to SF. I tried this place twice just so I could make sure the first scrumptiously foodgasmic meal wasn't a mistake. It wasn't. Brenda's combines my love of all things fried, cheesed, chocolated, buttered, and spiced - and trust me I've tried lots of all those - into one restaurant. Here, I've had the best ice tea, omelet, and cheddar crawfish baked pie (I forgot the real name). My dining companion's omelet was the first item I tried. With every bite of omelet, I had a mouthful bacon goodness. I started to regret not getting that omelet, until my crawfish pie came. The buttery crust mixed in with cheddar made up for not getting the omelet. Forget the sodas and alcohol for drinks. Stick with the watermelon iced tea whenever they come to take your drink order. It'll refresh you, even if you're already fresh when seated. Why the 4 stars and not the 5? While the beignets - I've tried the chocolate and crawfish - were good, I felt there was room for improvement. The beignets were a little too doughy with not enough filling for my preference. I also would have preferred that the layer of what I assume to be paprika on top of the crawfish beignets be eliminated. I started coughing because there was just too much of it. The pancake batter is light and fluffy, which is exactly how I like my pancakes to be. The downside is that the particular mixture I got - plum crumble - was too tart for my taste. I ended up picking out the plums to reduce the overwhelming court flavor. For almost immediate seating, come on a weekday later in the afternoon (around 2). Be sure to bring enough quarters for street parking, because that's all there are. Update to come once I get the chance to have dinner here. I'm sure I'll have to wear stretchy pants afterwards but I'll do what I must for Yelp.

My daughters really wanted to come here after I showed them pictures of Brenda's dishes on yelp. So they decided Father's Day would the day to go. I was worried there might be a long wait for a table, but after getting there at 9AM on sunday, the wait was only 30 min for a table for five. For starters, we got the beignet flight. You have to get this. The crawfish beignet was by far the best one. Crawfish, cheese, onions, paprika, crispy, savory, soft, and hot. The community coffee with chickory goes well with the sweet beignets. The signature watermelon iced tea was not too sweet, refreshing, and free refills. My daughters took care of the sweet beignets and split a fried chicken eggs benedict, my son got a 2 egg breakfast, my wife ordered the bananas foster french toast, and I got the pork belly and grits. The fried chicken benedict was delicious. They use a biscuit instead of an english muffin and the chicken had a cornmeal crust and the hollandaise sauce was rich and tasty. My wife's bananas foster french toast were pretty freakin' good too. Had just the right amount of caramel sauce and bananas on the buttery, egg battered slices of toast. But the pork belly and grits were incredible. The pork was crispy and tender, the grits were cheesy, the tomato bacon gravy added the perfect amount of spice to the dish. We'll definitely be back to try the gumbo and po-boy sandwiches. Chef Brenda's Creole-Filipino upbringing really influences the tasty food. Bring a group, order different dishes and try everything. You won't be disappointed.

Mimosas here are strong and cheap! The iced tea here is delicious too...so much my brother kept getting refills and had to pee every 30 minutes afterwards for the rest of the day...that was annoying. My brother I split the Beignet Flight which is completely worth it. The chocolate, granny smith, and the crawfish were so hot that cutting it open basically let out steam. You may be surprised by the spicy taste of the crawfish but it's actually not spicy. It was so delicious I never had melting Ghiradelli chocolate like that before. Probably because I'm sheltered. This is definitely worth it and you can't miss out on this. The Hangtown Fry is delicious. The scramble made you feel like you were eating a mashed sausage burrito but the skin was basically a thin layer of egg. The fried chicken is excellent. I never fried chicken could taste better than KFC, Popeyes, or Zaxby's. I wish I was fatter so I can fit more food in. Only down side is that you're going to have get really comfortable with your neighbors. Fortunately everyone we sat next to here was super nice.

Brenda's got SOUL! One of the most talked about places in SF. This place is really nice looking and a good light feel walking in. The seats were filled and I was lucky to grab an empty table before the lines gathered up. The service was okay. They forgot a few things but quickly brought it to us when we asked. I had the Shrimp and grits, gumbo soup, beignets sampler, and fried shrimp po boy. The shrimp and grits were the highlight. The flavoring that you get from it is strong and sweet. The shrimp is cooked nicely. The grits had a runny feel to it. I loved it. The gumbo soup was some of the best gumbo I've eaten. With big chunks of meat and okra it was yummy! The beignets sampler were hits and misses. The texture of the beignet was nice but the stuff inside was okay. Make sure to eat the plain one with the homemade strawberry jam. delicious!!!! The fried shrimp po boy was good stuff. The sauce makes everything in this dish. The bread was a little disappointing but the fried shrimp made me keep eating after I was already stuffed. I definitely wanna come back. Recommendation: Shrimp and Grits, plain beignet, and gumbo soup

Absolutely delicious!!! I was iffy about the crawfish beignets, but it is absolutely a must order. It's a simply delicious; cheese and crawfish stuffed in a nice dense/ fuffy dough. I ordered the ribs and oh man they were good the meat fell off the bones the sauce was delicious. The portion was good two large ribs with collard greens and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was quite bland and I have never been quite fond of collard green but the ribs were just that good. We also ordered the shrimp po'boy, it was delicious as well large fried shrimp but still the ribs were still better. I had a ron and Mac and cheese left over so I had it to go and man in the morning my mouth was salivating thinking about the left overs. The best thing of all is that the ribs were just as good the next day. One word, YUMMMM!!!!!!!!!!

Lend me your ear (ok, eyes) for a second and I'll tell you a tale of one of the top (if not THE top) brunch experiences I've had in San Francisco... It was a brisk (what day in SF isn't, really?), Sunday afternoon and three sisters had a hankering for brunch (which is totally the new happy hour). Armed with the Yelp app, and some insider info, they made their way to the Tenderloin. Yes, the TL, as the locals call it. Now, the TL gets a bad rap, but most of it is deserved, however there are some real diamonds in its rough if you're willing to put on your prostitute and druggie repellant and make the trek there. Brenda's already had a wait (which is a given since they serve a flight of beignets), among other phenomenal dishes. Instead of wallowing in "why didn't we get up earlier" pity, we walked over to Phillz for a little pre-brunch beverage and snack while we waited. We prob did wait close to an hour but we found a pocket of sunshine to stand in and sipped on our warm beverages so it wasn't completely unbearable. They have a specials board outside that makes you drool in anticipation of what will soon be plated in front of you, and on this particular day I had decided on the pulled pork eggs benedict. It was gorgeously designed with a huge, fluffy poached egg with a silky stream of just enough yolk to complement the pulled pork on the creamy biscuit. Seriously, a whopper, and as if that wasn't enough, it came with some killer bfast potatoes/hash. I also ordered a Creole Bloody Mary that wasn't really as exciting as it sounds, but the dish was so spot on that the drink really wouldn't have held a candle to it any way. Sadly we didn't order the beignets, as our eyes were bigger than our hunger pains, but that just means a visit to Brenda's will be in my SF future. The end.

The Watermelon Ice Tea is not to be missed.  So simple, yet so delicious! I absolutely love this place.  Take note though that it is not open all day :-( and it can get really, really crowded sometimes.  When you have to wait to get a seat, it's torture because the food smells as good as it tastes. Brenda's is my first stop on every visit to SF!

I have always enjoyed dining at Brenda's with friends. The service has always been attentive every single time I have gone with the exception of yesterday. This is just a warning for what's in store for you should this individual (young Asian girl the one WITH a ponytail) "serve" your table. When our waitress was able to make it to our table, the expression on her face said it all "I don't want to be here". It set the tone for the meal. I said that my friend and I would like to start with a couple of mimosas and my friend ordered the fried chicken and I posed a question: What do you think of the special, the shrimp pot pie? She dodged the question and said to get the shrimp and grits. So I asked again, how's the pot pie? And she again said to get the shrimp and grits, because everyone gets the shrimp and grits . At this point I was floored because she obviously wasn't listening to what I was asking her. As a frequent to Brenda's, of course I've had the shrimp and grits, and wanted to try the special. So I asked if she had the pot pie, and she said she hadn't and couldn't tell me anything about it. I let it slide, maybe she's new, I thought to myself. A good fifteen minutes later our mimosas and waters still had not yet arrived. I tried to flag down our waitress, but she made direct eye contact then looked away. I was starting to get annoyed now. Few minutes later she arrived with our food without saying anything, no enjoy, nothing, so I tapped her arm and kindly asked her to just cancel the mimosas. Confused, she said that she forgot to put them in and I just asked if we could have waters instead. Now I was pissed at the bad service we were getting. She didn't even apologize or anything beyond stating that she didn't put it in, she didn't offer to rush the drinks, nor did we get a check in to see how our food was, which was great, the food here is always spectacular! Our waitress did not come to our table the rest of the meal. It appeared to us that she sent a nice gentleman server to drop and pick up our check, because she did not want to face us and come to terms with the bad service she gave us. I also work in the hospitality industry, as bad as things were going, had she apologized, showed us some kindness, or even refilled our waters, my friend and I would not feel the need to warn everyone about this girl. Thatexperience was not at all the Brenda's hospitality I am accustomed to. I have had excellent experiences with all the other servers that have helped me out before. I was just shocked at the level of service we were given by this individual.

Straight up, if Brenda brought those crayfish beignets out to The French Laundry in Yountville and charged $20 a pop for em' they would STILL sell like mad... (not that i've ever been to The French Laundry, but, you know, it's the thought that counts...) ---- Again- Straight up- Brenda's French Soul Food is amazing. There is no other way around it, it's 5 stars easy-peasy. The flavor is off the charts, and it is extremely affordable for a 5 star meal, imo.  I mean damn, dat BBQ Rib. Dat Crawfish.

One of my regulars at a restaurant I used to work at suggested I try this place out. She mentioned that Brenda (the owner) was a Filipina from New Orleans and that her food was to die for. Well I finally took her advice and came in for lunch with my boyfriend and shared... - 2 watermelon iced teas (mediocre) - an order of craw fish beignets (we both agreed they were just ok...a little on the salty side) - a cup of gumbo (which was really really good...great spices) - and two orders of shrimp po boy sandiwches w/ skinny fries (also really really really good...simple but delicious) Can't wait to try other dishes.

I went with a good friend of mine on Easter Sunday. For the record I am always skeptical of a restaurant that offers any kind of soul food in a western metro city. For it to be a busy brunch holiday, we were seated 30 mins or so after we came in. I always love when a restaurant lets you drink your coffee while you wait, especially when its in a nice mug! I ordered the special of the day which was fried green tomatoes eggs benedict. WOW! I didnt expect it to taste so good! Sure the tomatoes were soggy but it happens. My biscuit was great and my grits were nice and creamy! This is not a place I would visit on the regular but for the occasion I enjoyed myself

I had such high hopes, but it was just OK... I love signing in on the chalk board to get on waiting list.  The staff are very friendly yet oh so overwhelmed.. The beignets are so big that they seem dry not light and airy like I so love .. ( bigger is not always better) The Coffee is great and the atmosphere is great  buuuuuut it's all about the food and Brenda's was a disappointment ... :(

4 stars for service, decor, staff, concept, menu. What brings it down for me is the fact that the music is a bit too loud and it was a bit hard to converse. I don't really enjoy the black eyed peas (I believe that's what they are) that they give you while you wait. I haven't enjoyed the crawfish beignets, sadly (mine were very salty). I didn't enjoy the shrimp and grits (not enough flavor). The mac and cheese, red beans and rice, and the drinks are great. The prices are very reasonable also.

Decent, and filling, Louisiana fare, at under $15/person, for breakfast or lunch (dinner may be slightly higher). It was a cool, cloudy, weekday, at lunch, when I decided to head over and give Brenda's a try. For years, I'd seen people huddled around the front door, awaiting seating, at peak meal times, and was ready to see if the wait was worth while.  Myself and a friend arrived around 11:45, on a Friday, signed in, and were seated in about 10 to 15 minutes.  The crowded dining room, with large plates with mountains of food, and mouths chomping away, immediately turned on my hunger switch. Before even peaking at the menu, I knew I wanted beignets, as I'd heard positive feedback about them.  However, upon peaking at the menu, I saw that not only did they have the traditional, plain powdered sugar beignets, but they also had chocolate filled, granny smith apple, and crawfish flavors, as well as a beignet flight, where you can get a sampling of each!  I opted to be a traditionalist, and went for the plain.  On the plate, were three pillows of fried dough, rather generous in size, crisp and brown on the exterior, a little dense, but moist, on the interior, and were piping hot.  For my main meal, I decided on the muffaletta.  When it arrived, I saw two fist-full sized portions of bread, generously stuffed with salami, ham, and cheeses, accented with a fragrant olive spread.  Crisp, addictive french fries accompanied the dish.  I was only able to consume half of the portion.  My friend, who ordered a shrimp creole pot pie, a special of that day, wasn't as satisfied.  To our disappointment, her pot pie had only one shrimp in it, which could have been just a one off occurrence, who knows....   I kind of regret that I didn't wash it all down with their sweet watermelon iced tea, but it was an item that caught my attention on the beverage menu. Brenda's, though double the size it originally was, still is tight on space, so there is likely to always be a wait queue at peak meal times, but as I said, my wait time of 10 to 15 minutes, for a table for two, was reasonable.  Of course, Brenda's is in the Tenderloin, so just be wary of the excrement covered sidewalks, outside, while you wait.  Once inside though, you'll feel much more sanitary, as it is a clean, well-kept space.

Brenda's is delicious! I especially love their grits dishes. They are covered with an entire layer of cheddar cheese. I've had their shrimp with grits as well as their weekend special of pork belly and grits. Both were wonderful. Their fried chicken, catfish, and po boys are also good. The only thing I've had that I didn't care for were their beignets. They are too doughy, and not crisp enough around the edges. Try to get there early. The place isn't very big and there is always a line. The last time I was there for brunch I waited 2.5 hours, but it was still worth it.

Place is always PACKED. My friend and I decided to order to-go to bypass the ridiculous wait. We took our food and drove over to Golden Gate Park to get our grub on, picnic-style! Our stash included the Hangtown Fry, a brunchy sandwich of some sort, the Beignet Flight, and the highly raved Sweet Watermelon Tea. The Hangtown Fry consisted of crisp oysters, bacon, & scallions. It was OK... in general I'm not a fan of steamed egg and this reminded me of it. And the oysters were not "crisp" whatsoever so they just added to the mushy-ness. I was done and over it halfway through. The watermelon tea was also just OK...I tasted fresh watermelon juices, water, and no sign of tea. I'm a true melon fan, and definitely a tea fan; but this missed the mark. My friend enjoyed her sandwich but didn't find it memorable. And given how filling the food is, she was only able to sample one of her beignets. She thought it was OK, too. They looked pretty dense and doughy (aren't they supposed to be light and fluffy?). Overall, I felt a little letdown since I absolutely love southern comfort food. Perhaps brunch time is just not for me and I should check them out for dinner. I could really go for some fried chicken!

Been here several times for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Everything is good! Beignets, crispy pork belly, grits, coffee, mimosas and my favorite watermelon ice tea. You won't be disappointed at this place. Super busy during lunch time on weekdays as well as Breakfast/brunch on weekends but worth the wait. While I waited for the rest of my party to show up I was given coffee to sip on. The folks here are super nice. Don't be afraid of the Tenderloin this is where you find some of the best food in the city. Take public transportation here if you can or cab it. Metered parking in this are is $3 for an hour and you have to take into account your waiting time!

Love this place when I want to indulge on a Saturday morning. It's all pretty hardy so I personally wouldn't go here for dinner...unless you want magic sleepy time =) Pace yourself! -Shrimp and grits are amazing, super cheesy and well-seasoned. - hangtown fry is good if you like oysters. -biscuit was so crumbly and the texture is almost like a fluffy scone...amazing! -crawfish beignet is savory and surprisingly delicious! Other sweet beignets were awesome too. -the sweet potato pancake with pecan syrup tastes just like pecan pie! Pretty yum P.S. the wait goes pretty fast....

Brenda, I love you for having this great restaurant.  I don't even mind walking through and into the heart of Tenderloin for this!!! I have been going here for years, and I am very that they have way more seating available now after expanding their tiny tiny space.  It is relatively easier to get in now.   I never got disappointed with anything I have tried so far.  I usually go for breakfast & brunch, I have to try the dinner sometime soon.

Already a billion reviews for Brenda's..including my own, but I felt the need to do an update! My girlfriend and I arrived for a late breakfast/early lunch.  I had completely forgotten that Brenda's had expanded and remodeled!!!  The new Brenda's is much more spacious!!!  Before, I swear, it felt like you would be sitting in a sardine can while eating..afraid of elbowing someone with every move.  Now you write your name on a big chalk board inside instead of on a list outside the door.  We arrived around 1115 and had a 10min wait..not bad at all! We were seated at a table near the kitchen and ordered drinks right away.  WATERMELON SWEET TEA!  I wish I had this at home all the time.  I love sweet tea, but with fresh watermelon it is even better.  And you get free refills! We started with the flight of beignet's.  I was a little disappointed this time bc they were a little over fried.  Much more crunchy than the first time I'd been here.  I overlooked it and ate them anyways, not like they were burned.  The chocolate is VERY chocolately..almost sickenly sweet.  Too sweet for my liking.  The apple one is DELICIOUS!  And the crawfish..you seriously cannot go wrong.  We were both pretty full by the time we got to the crawfish beignet... And then our food came.  I ordered the oyster po' boy sandwich.  Let me tell you...when this thing was put down in front of me, I did not know how to eat it.  The sandwich arrives open faced.  I was afraid to cut it in half because I didn't want everything to fall out after taking one bite!  The oysters were fried just right!  Crispy but not so crispy that it cut up my mouth.  The spicy sauce had a nice kick to it but didn't set my mouth on fire.  I had a few fries and had to get the rest of my lunch boxed to go.   My girlfriend ordered the chicken étouffée, she said with a big smile on her face "it tastes so home made."  A few bites later she got the rest to go, too. $44 after tip.  We plan to come back again to eat more from the breakfast side.  So so happy Brenda's expanded their restaurant, and their hours!  Can't wait to come back again!

So hubs and I went there for dinner.  He likes beignets.   We sat and the service was efficient, but they didn't tell us there were any specials.   I found out about them thru looking at the foursquare app.   I personally don't get beignets.  The crawfish beignet was doughy.  It's plump and cute on the outside.  The skin of the beignet was heavy and thick.   And we got the three beignet dessert platter: one original, one chocolate filling, and one apple.  It was ok.

The other reviews were right, and I'm going to add to the hype. Their watermelon ice tea is amazing - I couldn't believe it when I read it, but this is the sheeet (&this isn't even one of those asian drink places!)! Favorite thing(s) from their menu: chocolate and crawfish filled beignets. Note: they're not as fluffy as Angeline's in Berkeley, but they're filled with YUMMM! genius! :) Some not so favorite things: Their wait was over an hour long for 3 people on a Sat morning. And it was a pretty sketchy trek to get over here - there were gypsies and a person who thought I was a soldier? I guess it's nice to know I'm not feeble looking!

so OMFAGASDHGASDGAJS. YUMMY. After Easter service with friends and family, we strolled over today, THE PERFECT WEATHER. and waited at Brenda's for an hour. That hour kind of flew by, and I'm glad we stayed because we had the most delicious food ever. We had the flight of beignets- my favorito one was the crawfish beignet, I had some worries that it might be spicy, but it was so amazing!! I ordered the watermelon iced tea, it was great!! I'm becoming a drink fanatic. (tangent: I had a green tea lemonade with lychee at OtG, and I had a peruvian chicha morada- purple corn juice with spices). and they came with unlimited refills. wonderful. I kinda wish I knew more than one language fluently so I can compliment it in different languages and sound like the sophisticated lady I'm not.. better learn some french. I also ordered the gruyere ham and cheese sandwich with fries, great!! and the fries were thin cut, just the way I like it. Pops ordered the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. never had grits before, probably wouldn't like grits unless it was Brendan.. (Brenda made) Momma had the sweet potato pancake with butter pecan sauce which was just delicious. one of my fav things about this place, is the huge portions. which means, luxorious leftovers for the next week!!! the end. careful, you might have a coma afterwards and you might wanna work out until the end of time, but it's all worth it.   I feel like the little things made this place five stars- like the mirrors on the concrete wall (not really a little thing, but they do pay attention to deetails), the chalkboard sign in sheet, (I like chalk) and the old-skool fans on the ceiling make it seem so southern, and the unlimited refills, which just adds to the flavah!   I feel like super super spoiled. I think I'm going to come here during Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Valentines, St Patty's Day, Easter, Birthdays and all the random days in between!

I set my alarm clock early just so we can come here at 8am on Sundays (free parking plus no wait). Crawfish beignets is a must for me everytime. The BF does not like crawfish, but he likes the regular beignets. That's a biggie for the boy that grew up with Cafe du Monde's beignets and have written off practically all the beignets he's tried. My other must...watermelon ice tea. I love the watermelon bits in the tea and bottomless. I've been working my way through the menu and so far I have not hit anything I wasn't a fan of. Come early to avoid the wait. I think the earliest I've seen the wait start was around 8:45am - 9am.

Had a disappointing breakfast at Brenda's. the wait was about 45 minutes, but with the popularity of this place we were prepared to wait awhile. I had the veggie omelet which tasted like mold. Maybe it was the seasoning and something like saffron which I usually don't like, but tasted really strange; the potatoes were cold. I sent them back and ate the biscuit was good, but at that point I didn't care. The waiter seemed to care less, maybe because he was a hipster or maybe because Brenda's is so popular they don't need to care. Well Brenda's, been there done that, and I am not coming back.

I don't understand how this place has 4 stars... My first experience at Brenda's was weak, but over a year ago, so when my wife said she wanted to try their brunch, I was hesitant.  I gave in hoping this outing would prove better than my previous experience. I was wrong. Here's a quick run down of our brunch @ Brenda's this morning: 1. Runny egg white omelets 2. Dirty water cups 3. Over cooked beignets 4. $4 for a side pancake The good news? Their biscuits were pretty good and it's not as crowded when you arrive at 9:30.

C'mon.......all hype. Did I go to the wrong Brenda's everyone says is so bomb? Everything was either covered in oil or butter, and I love clogging my arteries with lard!! but this is too much. beignets??? bleh. They need to try Chinese donuts or Trish's donuts. Best thing here were the biscuits and jam. When I took my leftovers home, which was everything I ordered, the boxes were soaked with oil in minutes. Luckily, I didn't have to wait long to sit, or I would've been more disappointed.

The crawfish beignets are the best.  Next best is shrimp and grits.   I measure how much fat, oil, and/or butter is in the food by how quickly I get full.  I'm full after the first 3 bites.  But they are 3 glorious bites indeed.   So glad they expanded the place, now the wait isn't 2 zillion hours anymore.

Beignet sampler, shrimp and grits. Amazeballs! This is a great spot in the city for soul food. The shrimp and grits were delicious - creamy with cheddar sprinkled on top, sweet/smokey bacon crumbles, scallions and tomatoes, with just the right amount of kick to add some heat. Fantastic dish! The beignets are lighter than a doughnut with the perfect dusting of powdered sugar. The savory beignet, the crawfish one, had melted cheese and crawfish, with scallions pouring out of the middle. All were flavorful and yummy. I hear the watermelon iced tea is good, so I'll have to try that next time. I had a cup of their Community coffee with chicory, a splash of cream and a little sugar. We were lucky enough to come up on a Monday morning for breakfast, since we are from the South Bay and assumed Brenda's would be PACKED on a weekend for breakfast/brunch. I'm guessing this is the truth, since the place had filled up by 9:30 am on a Monday morning. The good news is, this usually bodes well and indicates a delicious meal to come - we were not disappointed!

This place is amazing. So far I've had the shrimp po-boy, Brenda's fried chicken (BFC), a pulled pork po-boy, the fried peach pie, and the cream biscuits. The watermelon tea is also really good. Everything I've seen or smelled here is fantastic. Most meals cost around $10 and arrive very quickly, even when they are very busy. Definitely recommended. *Note: They can get VERY busy, and are a relatively small restaurant. I waited about an hour outside but it was well worth it. Allow enough time for the wait, especially on the weekend, but weekdays outside of normal dinner hours aren't nearly as busy.

Great food and a perfect place for brunch on a Sunday morning. Expect to wait in line for 20-30 generally unless you get lucky.  The surrounding area while you wait isn't the best of areas but it's well worth your time.  The decor inside is very well done with high ceilings, natural sunlight, and a french style theme which makes you forget your eating in the tenderloin.   All the dishes I've ordered here have been great.  My surprisingly favorite dish I definitely recommend is the crawfish beignets.  I was skeptical at first because I thought combining seafood with a beignet would be terrible mix but somehow this turned to be my favorite item on the menu.  They pack the crawfish into the beignet with cayenne, scallions, and chedder which compliment the crawfish which is somehow amazing fresh tasting as I don't know of any crawfish farms in the bay area.  Next visit I am trying the grits and shrimp for sure ^_^

I'm the type of person that if I don't eat or drink coffee by a certain point in the morning/afternoon, I get extremely cranky. The thought of waiting for over an hour and a half for brunch at Brenda's sounded excruciatingly painful but being up for an brunch adventure, I decided to suck it up and go. The boyfriend and I arrived at Brenda's around 12:30 and luckily we were seated about 30 minutes later...SCORE! Be prepared to wait for awhile, especially during peak brunch hours, because it definitely gets crowded. There is a board that you can put your name on and counter seating is first-come-first -serve. Specials are listed on the boards outside and the afternoon we went, they were offering a Catfish Eggs Benedict, which my boyfriend ordered. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and we also shared the flight of the beignets (plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish). The beignets had to be my favorite part of the meal and I highly recommend them! My favorites were the plain and crawfish beignets. The plain was covered in powdered sugar and was light and sweet; the crawfish beignet was sprinkled with paprika and it was very spicy and savory. We both loved our benedicts but I'd have to say the catfish benedict was the best out of the two. The catfish was crispy and light, perfectly fried. Both benedicts were made on biscuits and came with a side of potatoes. I thought the biscuits were a little dry. The hollandaise sauce was great - creamy and just a bit spicy. If you are really hungry, I'd recommend these! It was way too much food for me, though. Service was fast and efficient. Our server was kind and always made sure we had everything we needed. She convinced us to get the flight of beignets and I'm glad she did because we got to try a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed brunch at Brenda's and will definitely go back, especially for those beignets! ;)

Brenda has soul! If they have those sweet potato pancakes, get them and ask for some extra syrup to take home and bathe in! The shrimp and grits were great! I don't know what she does to create that sweet tomato and bacon gravy, but it's amazing on those cheesy silky grits. The biscuits are larger than Hollywood celebrity implants and a lot softer! Whatever you order, get a side of ham. That is the sweetest, smokiest, slice of lovin' I've ever had. I love this place and plan on stopping back by when I'm in town again. Wear comfy shoes, because she attracts quite a crowd and you may be standing on Polk St. for a lil while, but it is TOTALLY worth it!

The food here is excellent.  The biscuits will make every other biscuit you have pale in comparison.  I have only been here for brunch, and not later in the day, but brunch here is worth the extremely long wait.  It's best to expect a 40-60 minute wait on a weekend, but those minutes are worth the Andouille sausage and the biscuits. The service here is not extraordinary, but it's completely understandable given how busy the restaurant is, and the noise level can be loud depending on the day and time.  But, once your food arrives you'll be too busy eating to notice or care because it is that good. Oh, and if you're a chocolate fan, or a donut fan, get the beignets.  You won't be sorry.

I wanted to love this place so much more than I did, especially given the awesome name of the place! ;-) Luckily I have seen the lines before so we showed up just before 9a on a Sat morning, so the wait was nary 5 minutes. Off to a great start! The flight of beignets was delicious! However, quite a bit of food to eat right before your breakfast. The chocolate one reheated nicely for a snack later though! My chai latte was lovely and served super speedy, and I got a free half cup of coffee once I was done - yay! I didn't really care for the pulled pork benedict special that I ordered. The creole hollandaise just did not work for me. To me it tasted like there were undertones of dirt, my palate tends to be sensitive to spices like paprika/old bay. One of my poached eggs was also overcooked (I like 'em runny!) which was disappointing. The grits were spot on and super buttery (note - those ALSO reheated well for my snack later). My bf loved his choice of the beef medallions. Service was efficient. Not very personable, but maybe it was an off day. I would totally go back and try something else!

I came here first because nothing else was open in the area and I didn't feel like Taco Bell. This place was such a wonderful gem to stumble into. They had a pulled pork sandwich the first time I visited and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever tried. The next time I came back and had a pork belly dish with a poached egg and grits. I am not a huge grits fan but this dish was absolutely stunning. The service was ok but the food is well worth the drive.

Hmmm. Another one of those semi-overrated places I'd say. Didn't want to wait for a hour on Sunday morning so I ordered to-go and thank goodness I didn't. Not worth a 1 hour wait! Let me start by saying the CRAWFISH BEIGNETS ARE AMAZING. That crispy yet chewy dough and the delicious seafood insides....mmmmmmmm this is a MUST GET. THE ONLY THING WORTH EATING. Other things I ordered include the best-sellers aka Catfish Eggs Benedict (Catfish on top of Eggs Benedict w/ Potatoes) and the Hangtown Fry (Fried Oyster +ham in Eggs). I really didn't like the Hangtown Fry but it might be because I don't like oysters ....haha. The Catfish Eggs Benedit was mediocre too because I like my catfish crispy and melt-in-your-mouth, but it tasted strange on top of the eggs/made it soggy. The only thing I would come back here for is the beignets!!

I came here on a "business" meeting of sorts, about 2 years ago. It had made a great impression on me, and I really truthfully wanted to come back but I had forgotten....and time had passed. Well, this week, circumstances found myself and a friend at the SF Superior Court where they were striking. Everything was closed, so we decided "ef this" and went got brunch. Brenda's was so close, we couldn't resist. We got there, and ordered a "flight" of beignets - 2 choclate and 2 granny apple instead of the 4 sampler. Well worth the AMAZINGNESS. I ordered the like creole omellete with a biscuit and a side of country gravy. The omellete could use a little LESS oil. But the gravy for the biscuits - holy. mother. of. god. SO satisfied. I needed to be rolled out of there, but I couldn't stop eating. It was all so good. Totally satisfied and will repeat this experience and SOONER this time.

I came here on a very high recommendation which I am happy to say it lived up to! For dinner I sampled two of the sides, the candied yams which were delicious and not overly sweet or doused in sauce, and a bowl of grits which were ever so creamy!  And of course, all was made better with a tall glass of a delicious mimosa! I wish we had saved room for the beignets for dessert!  They offer a sampler platter of one of each type, plain, chocolate, and apple!  Next time! Brenda's is quite small and I am not sure if they take reservations so I would expect a wait, although service is quite fast and attentive!

I will start by saying that I enjoyed eating at Brenda's on previous occasions and have not had a problem until tonight. My dining companion is extremely allergic to dairy and is lactose intolerant ZERO tolerance. To most this condition is a preference, to my friend it is a restriction. We started out by asking server #1 what on the menu has zero dairy.  She replied all the entrees are safe, but not the Mac n Cheese ( not an entree).  Okay, so I ordered the chicken and my companion ordered the grits and shrimp. When our meal arrived, we were engaged in conversation and just started eating.  Then my companion noticed that there was what looked like cheese in his entree. we summoned Server #1 only to find out that yes there was cheese in his entree, a lot of cheese! Server #1 disappeared.  Server #2 who was nearby arrived to resolve the issue to no avail. Manager came over and I indicated my displeasure, and she was gracious but the damage is done. We left our food and walked out. I think it is important that Brenda's reviews it's menu items carefully with its staff and servers.  There are actually people with food sensitivities and allergies.  To most of the public this issue is mostly a preference, to my friend it is a condition.   At this point nothing could be done. We left the restaurant with anticipation of an evening with explosive diarrhea, and a possible trip to the hospital. No bueno, thanks Brenda's......

One of my all-time favorite spots in the city. Go early if you want to avoid long lines on the weekend. Be prepared to wait if you go a little later. However, it will be 100% worth it. The restaurant has a very cool vibe, and the food is delicious. I went with the shrimp and grits. It was amazing. The beignets were also a nice breakfast treat that you don't commonly see anywhere outside of New Orleans. I would recommend this place to anyone. Beware of the location in the Tenderloin. It is definitely a bit sketchy.

Since I've moved to the Bay area, I haven't brunch-ed very much. Perhaps it's partially due to being spoiled by NY brunches. Who knows. This was the most gluttonous (and sugary) meal I've had in a long while. Make sure you're very hungry; they have gigantic potions here. And when you finally decide what you want to order, get half of that. We started with a beignet flight (plain & chocolate) for the group to share -- which was delicious! And then proceeded to each order our own entrees. Huge mistake. We shared a few of bites from each of our entrees and barely made a dent. We tried the creole veggie omelette (which comes with their famous biscuits), granola pancakes w/ vanilla bean cream, and the butter pecan french toast. I'll admit, the butter pecan french toast sounded like it would be horribly sweet (especially after a beignet flight), but somehow they pulled it off quite well. Tip: Get their watermelon tea. It's awesome!

I will definitely give it 5 stars if they take reservation or if the line is not 2hours long. I came for a Sunday brunch! They have killer beignets!! Crawfish beignet was so fresh, creamy, and flavorful. The chocolate beignet was sooo good. The reason is the dough is chewy with right amount of everything!! Even my reheated left over tastes soooo good!!! a must try for sure! I also order Hangtown Fry, the best ever!! the oyster was so fresh and big, the scramble egg with bacon and scallion was cooked to perfection!! such a hearty meal  yet not heavy at all! I love this place.

If you're going to brave the long wait to dine here, don't forget to order the beignets!!! Yes, after a failed attempt during my last visit to SF to dine here (i was told there would be an hour and 45 minute wait at 11:00am), I was determined to nab myself a coveted seat at this local favorite the second time around and luckily checking in bright and early was the key to my success! Upon our arrival at 8:00am sharp, we were immediately seated in one of the cozy booths flanking the small restaurant.  I wasted no time in making my orders and the friendly server was impressively prompt as we got our orders at a fairly good pace, despite the mad morning rush. Among the favorites, i made sure i ordered the flight of beignets i've heard an earful about from my friends. Within moments my flight of delicious beignets came out fresh and piping hot! They ranged from light & fluffy (plain) to super dense & heavy (crawfish). I prefer the fluffier texture but I can see with all the ingredients stuffed inside how the beignet, needed a denser batter to hold in all that goodness! The crust was nice and crisp and upon breaking them open the inside was fluffy and soft.  My favorite was easily the crawfish beignet. It had chunks of juicy crawfish and it exhibited a pleasant savory flavor at the end of each bite from all the tasty spices! I recommend using the house made jam on the plain beignet, it's incredibly good. And you know how it goes, there's just something about that home made taste that simply can't be beat! My friend's hangtown fry was good but IMHO I'm not really into fried oysters too much so I doused my piece with some spicy louisiana sauce to kill the pungent "fishy" flavor.  Now if you're a fan of fried oysters, you've definitely gotta give this one a try! The grits were phenomenal! Warm, buttery, smooth with just the perfect bite to it! The biscuits were huge with a beautifully flaky crust! The inside was dense yet buttery soft! Good stuff! Shrimp & Goat Cheese Omelet - the eggs were cooked nice and fluffy! Filled with generous portions of creamy goat cheese and marinated shrimp.  It was a very substantial dish and virtually impossible to finish in one sitting, especially after the flight of beignets, grits and biscuits! Watermelon House Iced Tea - I washed everything down with this cool & refreshing concoction as recommended by our server.  With just a hint of sweetness, it was the perfect accompaniment to all the savory treats we had on the table! Overall, it was a successful run at Brenda's and it's safe to say i'll definitely be coming back to try some more of their tasty interpretations of traditional Creole favorites! Happy Eats!

The croque monsieur is hands down one of the best things I have EVER consumed. The first bite was mind-blowing. Service was also very quick. But I must insist they serve the mac & cheese during lunch and not only dinner! I will be back to try that, as well as a po' boy. I now understand the hype around Brenda's.

Got here around a late lazy afternoon and got seated in only 10 minutes! Ordered the Crayfish beignets, Eggs benedict florentine, Shrimp Grits, and Watermelon iced tea. Nice touch with the really refreshing watermelon iced tea that is actually bottomless. Very good summer drink. I think its really awesome you dont' have to get your hands dirty and still get to eat crayfish. The spices looks pretty crazy but I didn't think it was worth the hype. The eggs benedict was a perfectly cooked one with a bit of flare added in terms of the sauce. I don't usually like grits but decided to take a chance with it due to the rave reviews by other yelpers. Shrimps were pretty standard not overcooked and good but the cheesy grits makes you want to scrape the plate raw to get the last bit.

Brenda's is the kind of restaurant that I couldn't live next to. That's because, holycrapit'sdelicious I'dbefatandbroke, ohmygosh! Seriously, (cuss word), it's good! I checked out Brenda's for breakfast, and got to try the shrimp and grits, beignets, and the red beans and rice. Every. Dish. Was. Awesome. The shrimp and grits were ridiculously cheesy and savory! Each bite was soul food heaven. The red beans and rice were perfectly cooked, and the andouille was just slightly crispy; I loved it. As for the beignets, heavy city. I could not, and did not completely finish the serving size. Four huge beignets loaded with absolutely delicious fillings (apple, chocolate, and crawfish). The apple and the crawfish were my favorites -- I'll post pictures. And... the last thing I'm going to mention is the watermelon sweet tea. AHHH! It's the perfect beverage for the coma-inducing feast that is a meal at Brenda's. Friends in Phoenix, go here if you're in SF. All others, go here if you're in SF. =)

Only been here once--got some fried chicken, a biscuit, gumbo, and beignets. Let me tell you, the biscuit was the best biscuit I have ever had in my life. It was huge and not at all dry like many biscuits I have had in my life. I love biscuits--it's just one of those random food items I happen to love consuming. Oh and their beignets were okay. The only other beignets I've had were at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, so I've been spoiled. The chicken was great, gumbo was great. A great brunch place. Sort of a wait though.

I should start with Dear Management,   I was excited to come here because of the reviews.  Walking in and being seated immediately was a plus..   Hold on it gets better.  We were not told that the specials were written on the board. OK no problem, we asked the person that seated us what the specials were, she RUDELY rolls her eyes as if we were asking too much from her.  As with any well known establishment with over 2000 reviews would not assume that each party (customers) are to be aware of the specials that are written on the board.  That when waiting for a seat, each party should read the specials before getting seated. Oh well... Did not even order from the specials too much of an effort for her to say Gumbo with my watermelon ice tea -tasteful BBQ pork ribs "eh I've tasted better" Getting the check from "her" was even more disrespectful.  Thanks for the welcome (Stephanie or Samantha whatever your name is).

Will refrain from giving 2 stars since I know that my review is pretty subjective and a minority opinioin given the multiple 4/5 stars from others.  Went with my foodie friend and we both felt the same way about the meal so this is 2 reviews in one. Been there for breakfast once and enjoyed their omelet tho, so maybe stick to breakfast stuff.  I left today feeling underwhelmed and feeling totally clogged.  Wished I had walked a block and half to Turtle Tower instead.   Here is what I ordered after reading reviews from yelpers: Watermelon Tea (you must love watermelon rind as well) Crawfish Beignet (you must love plenty dough and it wasn't crispy either) Cup of Gumbo (you must love undercooked rice.  Dish under seasoned dish and didn't come together) BFC (Went for thigh -- oil was dripping off it and smeared all over plate. Would have been worth it if it was crispy and flavorful but it was only meh) Shrimp and Grits (you must love tons of cheddar cheese)  This was the best dish of the lot though.  Flavorful and enjoyed it after removing half bowl of cheese. Oy...give me a veggie juice now!

I was a little concerned that we would have to wait forever and be disappointed at the food in the end but glad to report that Brenda's was delicious and 2 thumbs up! 3 of us came after church for Sunday brunch on Easter Sunday. We arrived at 11:05am and wrote our name on the chalkboard inside. The wait was approximately 1 hour as most of the party sizes were 2-3 (although there were a few parties of 5+). Beignet Flight: definitely need at least 3-4 people to order this. The craw fish one was unique and the apple one was tasty but they don't taste like beignets from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans; the beignets because they are stuffed have a much thicker texture. Shrimp & Grits-for my taste buds it was amazing! Just the right amount of cheese on the grits and the tangy tomato accompaniment with the shrimp was so good I couldn't put my spoon down! Husband had the fried oyster omelet and he said it was tasty. The biscuit was really buttery and good. My friend had the grits with the beef (I think it's the grillades and grits), that was also very tasty. Coffee was very good, nice and rich, and the watermelon ice tea was yummy with free refills! If it weren't for the wait, I would not hesitate to come back anytime I'm in the mood for a southern fix. The wait staff was also really nice given how busy this place is. Out of Brenda's, Dottie's, and Mama's I would say this is my favorite! Tip: they serve brunch all day on Sunday, maybe I'll come back for Brinner (brunch and dinner) next time... =)

Good, solid cajun food. First time here after all this hype. Came on my lunch break to try Brenda's. Our table of four was seated pretty quickly, within 5 minutes. We ordered the Beignet flight to share. I ordered the jambalaya special and the rest of the table ordered pumpkin pancakes and the hangtown fry. The jambalaya special was pretty good food, but nothing special that jumped out at me. It came with a refreshing salad and decent portions. The crawfish beignet, even though I only had a fourth of one, was impressively tasty. The filling is ooey gooey goodness and I wish I had ordered a whole one myself. The rest of the beignets were sweet ones and though I enjoyed them, weren't particularly memorable for me. Will definitely be back again for the crawfish beignet and perhaps some of their other unique menu items.

We finally visited soul food as we craved for long time, after read reviews on yelp. Went in around lunch hour, I was surprised, I still had to write my name by chalk on the board. 3 or 4 groups were in front of us, didn't take long to be seated. This is a Wednesday (sort of brunch for us), restaurant is still full. It tells things. The good service adds up start to 4. Food, hmm. I really want to like it. Maybe I was a bit under weather today. Ordered Two eggs any style with linked sausage, and Beignets (4 orders). When they brought them, we were like 'Wow! OMG' Way more too big... :) Coffee comes with big cup, it tastes bitter. ( I would say bitter.) It seems I don't get used to the bean brewed from. Somehow, when I ate Beignets, even the chocolate's, I didn't feel sweetness in the mouth, as it supposed to on this kind. I took bite after we packed and brought home (couldn't finish 4 Beignets!), the flavor comes back. I would recommend chocolate and plain flavor. Now, that Asian waitress, hehe... If I saw the same one, people wrote about here, she worked with another lady on our orders/drink, they were both attentive. Came over to ask if things were all right, if we need anything etc .. Suggested us not to order too much, we were thinking to add side french toast. She wasn't sure how much side costs when I asked, at last, said, we could order half of it... Eventually we dropped the idea.

Thank you yelp! LOVED this place.... so from reading all the other 5* reviews, apparently you'll be waiting in some long lines if you come in the morning. Well... here's what I did -- somewhat unplanned actually. But... if you go at 7pm on a Sunday night, not only will you most likely not wait in line... you can actually get seated right away! I totally scored! First of all, because it was Sunday Free metered parking was easy to find on the street. And then I was able to just walk in and get sat. I ordered the Watermelon iced tea - -which was more fabulous than it sounds. And the Fried Green Tomato Benedict - - a special on the board, not on the regular menu. The tea was amazing -- didn't have the bitter taste of tea, and wasn't that sweet. The FGT Bene -- OMG! Wow.... soooo soooo soo good! I ordered it with the hash (photo). OMG... amazing!! Service flat out rocked! Great experience here on a Sunday evening!

Brenda's is a top notch breakfast place that offers unique food from the Old "dirty" South! I'm not really sure what that means, but it sounds cool so I'll run with it. First, the biscuits: Light and flaky on the inside with a nice crisp exterior. The one benchmark for a good baked item is asking the question " Is it good on it's own without butter?" Uhhh...YES! Next, uniqueness: The shrimp and grits breakfast is delicious, but my friend trumped that by ordering the grillades and grits. I'm not going to describe them so let curiosity kill your cat. Third, sweetness: beignet flight - plain, chocolate, or granny smith. Bananas foster french toast, chicory coffee to wash down all that sugar. Throw caution to the wind, give your "eating healthy" phase a break and just enjoy a good hearty breakfast. Brenda's will not disappoint!

Yesterday I found ten dollars in my pocket. (FREE MONEYS!) I thought about what I should do with it. Go see a movie? Buy something useful for my new apartment? Find myself a cheapy shirt or jewelry at XXI? NOPE. Wanna know what I did with that ten dollars? I marched myself directly to Brenda's and ordered a beignet flight. Four pillowy, deep-fried pockets of happiness were placed before me and I happily noshed until my pants felt too small.  Washed it all down with their refreshing watermelon iced tea.   Come here, order these, and wear stretchy pants.

If I gave Mama's 4 stars, Red Door Cafe 5 stars, and Dottie's 5 stars, then Brenda's definitely ranks among the 5 star brunch places here in the bay area that I've reviewed thus far.  The great thing about Brenda's is that you will get brunch with a unique, Southern twist, so it's not just another re-hashing of eggs benedict with oh what, a slight spin on hollandaise sauce, or yet another omelette with some conglomeration of ingredients that includes some form of cheese, veggie ,and protein. Instead, you get things like sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce, crawfish beignets (damn freakin amazing), pork belly with cheesy grits and eggs, and other such brunch foods that have a unique Southern twist and flavor. As every review here has confirmed, you can't go wrong with the beignets.  I only tried the crawfish ones as I wanted something savory, but as you can tell from others on here, all of the other ones are pretty tasty as well.  Definitely try the pork belly special and the sweet potato pancakes if you're here (if possible), and your stomach will thank you (even if your thighs, butt, or belly will hate you later). This place is easily on the list of places to revisit, and I think the line is slightly shorter than some other places in the city.  Plus, there's a higher chance that you'll be able to find parking (after all it is pretty much in the Tenderloin). Yay Brenda's!

I liked it!  Came here for breakfast with hubby on a weekday to avoid the crowd which is the best idea in the whole world!  We are seated immediately with no wait!  Ordered the chocolate beignets, grillades and grits, as well as the shrimp and grits.  Pretty darn tasty from our perspective but just to warn you, I'm a big fan of grits so anything with grits for me wins!  But the chocolate beignets put me over the top, i had to stop myself from overindulging and had the arduous chore of taking them home and eating them later!  Oh the horror.... {wink wink}. We'll be back for sure, just need on a weekday morning!

Waited an hour to get in and it was absolutely worth it. Scrumptious watermelon sweet tea and yummy fried chicken Eggs Benedict. I am infatuated with Eggs Benedict so that's what I order wherever I go for breakfast/brunch. The fried chicken instead of Canadian bacon and biscuit instead of English muffin is genius. I'm a huge fan of biscuits and fried chicken, so this obviously is a masterpiece to me. They paired well with the Hollandaise sauce. If I had more room in my stomach I would've ordered the shrimp and cheddar grits as well. I tried my friends and it was amazing too. The crawfish  beignets and the Ghiradelli beignets were also mighty tasty. What makes this all a perfect meal is the great service and decent prices. Our waitress was super funny and attentive. Too bad we don't have a Brenda's in LA.

Food was DELICIOUS, got the raved crawfish beignets, pulled pork eggs benedict (on biscuit!! YUM), french toast and their watermelon Ice tea. What gave it five stars is the tentative service and smiles despite the fact that they were busy as hell. Manager does this quick walk around the restaurant and he spotted the dirty dish in the midst of our table crammed with food  and offered to clean it up for us.

Our last stop of the afternoon before we went rock climbing, we arrived and wanted to just plop down and take a nap.  We got there mid-afternoon, so it wasn't packed, which was really nice.  They still wouldn't let us sit down though, until our whole party arrived.  We had to wait for a bit since people were meeting us, but it wasn't too bad.   For how full we already were, we went a little overboard on how much we ordered.  We got the gumbo, shrimp and grits, the flight of beignets, a shrimp po'boy, and of course the watermelon sweet tea (amazing!).  Everything we had was really good - I wouldn't say it's quite on par with the stuff we got from NOLA itself, but it was a pretty good try.  The watermelon sweet tea is really delicious, and would make me go back just for that.

I came here for breakfast and tried their beignet flight.  It was a sampler of their four beignets.  There was a plain one that was fluffy on the inside.  The chocolate and the fruit filled one was ok.  The last one had crawfish in it.  That one was tasty.   I think the beignet flight is good so you can try all four, but next time, I will just get the crawfish one.

After years of drooling over the menu, but never having a chance to try it out because it closed at 3 pm and I clock out at 3:30 pm (well, 3:23 to be exact), they have finally decided to serve dinner from 5-10pm Wednesday to Saturday.  I could not have been more ecstatic to find this out, and my good friend and coworker, Joann L., and I headed over there for a 'date' this past Friday. Holy crap.  All the hype about this place is truly warranted.  There are not enough words to describe Brenda's food:  Rich.  Savory.  Luscious.  Mouth-watering.  F^&*ing amazing.  For realz. We both ordered a crawfish beignet to start off with, I ordered the shrimp 'n grits and she ordered the red beans 'n rice, and we shared our entrees with each other.  Oh dear Lord,  the shrimp 'n grits should be considered a controlled substance.  One of the the most decadent foods I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.  You may think that I'm going a bit overboard in my description, but I'm 100% serious.  I want this to be my last meal on Earth.  Creamy, buttery, cheesy grits with a generous number of shrimp swimming in a spicy gravy with bacon in it.  BACON!  'nuff said. The red beans and rice was phenomenal as well.  Smoky and spicy stewed kidney beans with andouille sausage and steamed rice.  Yum.  Best I ever had. The beignet was delicious and like nothing I've ever eaten.  I was sad I didn't get to taste the Ghirardelli chocolate beignet because I ate too damn much.  Oh well.  Next time  (And there will definitely be a next time in the near future). Oh, and you have to try the watermelon iced tea when you go.  It sounded really sweet to me and I almost didn't order it, but the slight bitterness of the tea and the sweetness of the watermelon complimented each other perfectly and tasted EXACTLY how summer tastes if it were to have a flavor. If you are on any kind of diet, do not get within a block of this place.  You may very well gain weight just LOOKING at the food.  But if you want a unique and extremely indulgent meal, then go check out Brenda's!!! P.S.  Get there EARLY if you don't want to wait forever.  We arrived around 5:20 pm and were seated immediately.

I got the catfish sandwich which was cooked perfectly and had that delicious sauce. I tried some of my sister's cheesy grits with shrimp dish. I didn't think it would be good since I don't particularly like cheesy grits and I didn't get why it was paired with shrimp. However, all of my feelings were changed when I ate some! One of the BEST things I have EVER eaten. The atmosphere was also really nice, like a busy New Orleans style cafe. The Benes (sp?) were good, although a little too big for me to finish in one sitting. Definitely for sharing.

A GREAT brunch place with a different touch to the standard American fare. The food... simply amazing food.  For any table larger than three, I would recommend the flight of beignets, it has a good mix, but I'm partial toward the warm crawfish one.  I would also take a good look at their specials for the day.  The table had a good mix of specials and standard orders.  All of which were good! The restaurant... get there early, get there with your full group, and be prepared to wait if you don't.  It can get to be a long wait and if you're not prepared, it can be or feel longer.  Go in, write your name, and adjust your count if necessary, but try to be right on from the get go. Overall... worth another visit, but I'll need to play ahead better next time.

I was in the area attending a speech given by Richard Bolles at the S.F. Main Library. A friend met me there and after the talk ended we decided we were in the mood for a good meal. It turns out that this place is within easy walking distance from the library. What a meal! This place is amazing. I've got to hustle back for more. The decor is pretty cool. I've heard that it gets packed on weekend nights and I can believe it. This evening was mellow and the crowd was a bit sparse. I'm good with a packed house or just a few as long as the food rocks. The waitress came by a couple of times while we were trying to decide on our orders. She insisted that EVERYTHING on the menu was amazing. Yeah right. Sure it is.  Turns out the woman was spot on. I had the Andouille sausage / Crawfish pot pie and my buddy had the shrimp and grits with a biscuit on the side. Man, I don't know what's in those biscuits but it should be illegal. They are ridiculously good. Nothing like 'em.  I've got my eye on the BFC(Brenda's Fried Chicken).  Who am I kidding? I've got my eye on just about everything on the menu. A word of advice: Get to this spot quickly because something tells me that sooner or later, Check Please: Bay Area is going to review this place and then good luck finding a table. You know what I mean?

If you were raised in the south, this place will surely disappoint.  Since my best friend was raised in Baton Rouge and a cajun food lover through and through, I was thrilled to take her to Brenda's given the review and recommendations from my friends.   Sad to say, the food was a complete let down (mind you we were starving by the time we got seated!).   BEIGNET FLIGHT: Best thing this place has to offer.  Good, but no where near authentic.  The dough was a lot more dense than what you find in Louisiana.   PULLED PORK BENEDICT: For something that made it to the special menu, there was nothing special about this one.  Shiesty on the pulled pork that wasn't even all that flavor packed to begin with...come on now! SHRIMP AND GRITS:  Extra buttery and cheesy...two ingredients that usually redeem any dish.  But why did the shrimp taste fishy in a weird way?   WATERMELON TEA:  Good but on the too sweet side. We had such high hopes for some great soul food!

Yes there was a line for this sf icon, however I felt that this was much more worth the 1/2 hour wait with a much more salivation inducing payoff. Unlimited watermelon iced tea...

I have absolutely no reservations about recommending this restaurant to anyone I meet. And we didn't even have dessert. Service was fast - (5/5) Ambience was great (4.5/5) for a trendy dinner with friends or an impressive (but not pretentious) first date. Bonus points for putting your own name up on the chalkboard waiting list. Food was great (4.5/5): Cajun oyster & The southern-style breaded oyster) - 5/5 Shrimp Po'boy - 5/5 (huge!) Biscuit - a little disappointing 3.5/5 The dessert beignets promise to be delicious. I'll be back for these soon.

Although Lael A. and I are big fans of dinner at Brenda's, we weren't impressed by our solitary breakfast experience there. We felt compelled to give breakfast at Brenda's another chance and I'm glad we did! I was jonesing to order a Crawfish beignet, which is my favorite beignet here, but the size of the entrees was too daunting. So straight to entrees we went! I really like Brenda's shrimp & grits so I decided to switch it up and try a daily special variation: pork belly, spicy onion relish, poached egg, cheddar grits. Now YOU KNOW Brenda is FIlipina if she can do pork belly this good! Although I would've preferred a crispier skin on the pork belly to contrast all the other soft components of the dish (mmmm... like lechon kawali), the tender pork belly was fork-soft, allowing me to mash it with the rest of the dish. The savory pork belly + spicy/sweet onion relish + creamy poached egg + cheesy, sinfully creamy grits made for bite after bite of decadent goodness. Lael A. had the fried chicken eggs benedict over biscuit. Admittedly, I ignored the potato hash because they were served cold. A capital offense at any breakfast spot, especially when we were the 2nd table to receive food in the opening hours. However, the hollandaise sauce, fried chicken, and biscuit were the saving grace of the dish. The sauce was a unique soul food take on Hollandaise, darker with a Cajun spice twist. The fried chicken as crispy, yet tender inside. And the biscuit, YUUUUUUM, Brenda's does biscuits sooo well. Incredibly flaky and buttery! We washed everything down with the watermelon iced tea (for me) and the community coffee with chicory (for Lael A). The watermelon iced tea is a MUST, whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It's my favorite iced tea: perfectly sweet with a subtle taste of watermelon. I had a few sips of the coffee and the "chicory" taste was unique: slightly bitter, a little nutty, kinda woodsy.

Go there early!! I came here, party of two at 9:30AM and there was no one in line.  But the restaurant was already full.  We grabbed the last tiny table.   I heard amazing things about this place especially for their Beignet and wanted to try. Breakfast: -Crawfish Beignets    2.75 each Spiced with cayenne, scallions & cheddar (I ate three!) So good.  I can't explain how wonderful this dish is!  No wonder it made the 7x7 list.  This is a MUST!  Don't mess with the other beignets.  Trust me this one is the best! -Shrimp and goat cheese omelete.  It was pretty good. BUT... mama is hooked on that crawfish beignet! SO Motha F-N Good!! Oh... I'm still not over it. The place gets 5 stars for food for sure.  1 star for the really snooty waitress who almost spoiled the day. She wasn't very friendly and threw the menu at us.  Not very nice. She was similar to the "soup nazi" from Seinfield. The food was soo good that you will deal with the poor service.  5 stars for the awesome food for sure!

DO NOT GET THE GRANOLA PANCAKES. With that said, everything else we ordered was lovely. The beignets were delicious. They did not taste at all deep fried which I was super happy about. You could almost say they were healthy, almost. Every single one of them had its own unique taste. & they were all very doughy, yum.  Chocolate beignet: was my favorite one. So rich and thick and gooey and slightly bitter all in one. So yum.  Plain beignet: was so not what I was expecting. I figured it would be boring compared to the others, but it was so the opposite. Beignet, no filling. Tasted just as amazing plain.  Crawfish beignet: was mm mm mm. A tad bit spicy, but handleable.  Apple beignet: I'm not a fan of warm apples in food, but for some reason I loved this beignet. The apple filling was not sour and not overly sweet which I liked. The honey was a nice touch. Shrimp & grits. Yum. The shrimp had a hint of sweetness. The grits were buttery and filling. & they topped it with green onions! The restaurant has high ceilings and a comfy feel. The tables are really close together, so much so that the people at the table next to yours could be included in your party, which isn't a bad thing if they're cool, but is if they're smelly. The latter happened to describe those sitting next to us. In case you were wondering about the pancakes, (which didn't really go with the rest of the menu, but sounded cool) they were soo dry. Granola itself is pretty dry, so Idk why I didn't see that coming in a pancake. I almost choked from drydom.

(See pics) Very happy to know that both areas (new and original) of the restaurant sides are open for a couple months and am glad that there were plenty of seats at 8:30am on a Saturday. There's more space among the tables that gives everyone more room. The setting is still better suited for small parties. Apart from what I always order, the original plain beignets, I had the special-- the very hot crispy pork belly dish was cooked to perfection. It was very rich and was excellent with the spicy onion. Always love the cheesy creamy grits and the poached egg made it a big bonus. Service is always fairly good.

I do not give many five-star reviews, but this restaurant deserves it.  The restaurant is long and narrow with grey concrete walls.  Tables are tight (and we enjoyed a fabulous conversation with our next-door table neighbors).  One wall is adorned with mirrors, while the other is a large mural of a crawfish.  The whole vibe is urban with a touch of New Orleans creole. The star of the show is the food and, at $40 for two, quite reasonably priced.  The crawfish beignet was wonderful and exotic (to me).  The fried chicken with collard greens and biscuits was fabulous. Chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  The biscuits were hot moist and buttery, a perfect platform for a fabulous jalapeno jam (which was surprisingly sweet with only a hint of a kick).  The collard greens were also good.  We also ordered catfish, which was over-the-top good and will be my selection next time we visit this restaurant.

Yay!  Nicely done, Brenda.  You make some damn tasty French soul food, m'lady.  We were trying to be healthy-ish, so we didn't order as much as we should have ;)  A cup of the chicken etouffee (awesome!), a cup of the gumbo (okay), and the flight of beignets for us to share.  The crawfish beignet was interesting (I would've preferred a big ol' bowl of crawfish etouffee, personally), and the plain and apple beignets were fine.  But the chocolate beignet was the hands-down winner.  I didn't think I could have a tastier beignet than the brilliance at Cafe du Monde, but the chocolate beignet here at Brenda's has topped my list.  Bravo!

I've only been here for brunch, and considering I don't like food aimed towards morning people this was very good. The shrimp and grits probably have to be my favorite. It had an intense seafood flavor, and I mean that in the most positive way possible. The crayfish beignets had an awesome filling. The dough was a little bready, but I think its supposed to be that way to keep everything intact. Expect an hour wait, but worth it.

Before I came, I've heard really good reviews about this place and it's brunch. Went this afternoon and felt like it was overhyped. The food was good but not amazing. The crawfish was bomb but in terms of the entree I picked (pulled pork Benedict), it was alright. Again, good but not amazing. We waited over an hour (got there at 10) - probably our fault for coming a little late, but still. Definitely a good one time brunch experience.

mmmm mmmm mmmmm! brenda's...where to start. your taste in music is as fantastic as your food. i swear me and my friends were going to get up and start dancing. any place that plays 3 James Brown joints in a span of an hour wins in my book. we got there after brunch so we had the limited menu, but even with a limited amount of choices to choose from we still had trouble. imagine if we had the whole menu..we'd be there for hours. anyway, i got a catfish po' boy, my friend got the oyster po' boy and we also got a beignet flight. catfish po' boy was off the hook! the bread was my favorite part. buttered and soft. the catfish just melted in my mouth. it was amazing. the portions were huge too! couldn't finish the sandwich and had to ask for a box. all the beignets were amazing. no other words needed. just amazing. looking forward to coming here again..with the full menu!

I've been coming here for a while now and I am in a rut! I always order two things: 1. Watermelon Ice tea (it's bottomless) and 2. Shrimp and Grits. I've tried plenty of other items on the menu by stealing bites off my friends plates. But seriously, there is nothing better than the shrimp and grits here. Got a hangover? Soothe your headache with the yummiest watermelon ice tea. I chug at least 2 full glasses full (and not because I'm asian and want to get my monies worth). Shrimp and Grits. Order it and thank me later :) People rave about the beignets, but I have a tough time really loving them. It's good, but doesn't compare to the ones I've had in New Orleans. They are a bit tough and too doughy. Judge for yourself. Like I said, people love them. ***The wait used to be killer, but they just expanded so it's not too bad anymore. YAY!

Food of the Breakfast Gods?...Yes it is! The gist: We were here for Sunday brunch and this place was packed! We came in and wrote our party on the chalkboard.  My party was quite large, so the wait was a decent ~15 minutes.   On to the goods:   To quench my thirst, I got the Watermelon Iced Tea.  Very refreshing. To start we ordered the Beignets - Granny smith apples, with cinnamon honey butter.  These puffy dreams were like eating the contents of an apple pie with a crisp donut shell.  Outstanding - 5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My dish,the Special of the Day, - Crispy Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits.  This dish was beautiful.  The pork belly was crisp and on a bed of the BEST cheesy grits I've ever eaten. -4.5 stars     http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Our Eggs Benedict - Fried Catfish.  I got a taste of this dish and it wasn't enough.  I wanted more than a bite.  Hollandaise - great.  Poached Egg - great.  English Muffin - good.  Fried Catfish - Awesome.  Those potatoes...add on the salt, pepper, and hot sauce.  So bland.  - 4 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Egg & Bacon Tartine.  I also had just a bite.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, eggs, and a French roll.  It was hearty and the tomato-bacon relish really put the dish together.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Croque Monsieur.  Baked ham & gruyère with béchamel sauce on sliced sourdough is a recipe for greatness. This dish was kicking ass and taking names.  Saltiness of the ham with slightly sweet and salty gruyère is a dynamic duo.  All this on top of my favorite type of bread, sourdough - 5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My advice: come early, leave happy - 5 stars

This place was UHHH MAZEEEE ING!  So worth the wait. We had French toast with some kind of butter pecan sauce... MELTEd in your mouth! Then I took a bite into my friends egg and bacon benedict with some orange sauce on the top and potatoes on the side.. So much flavor in one bite.. I can feel my mouth screaming from joy! Then we had plain, Granny Smith apple, chocolate and crawfish beignets... You gatta have these warm. You're going to experience salivation in your mouth as you are chewing! Don't worry.. Just take it in. Then I had the burger with fries and coleslaw.. The special orange sauce in the burger was full of flavor. Once you had one bite of the burger with one bite of cole slaw and a few fries with the hot sauce, you will phase everything out around you. It's ok.. Enjoy it! Everyone else is probably zoned out too. Price was very cheap for the amount of food we got. The service was very good. They were ALL friendly and helpful. Made everything perfect. Just do yourself a favor and go. Don't get intimidated by the wait. Trust. Me. Just. Wait.

I'd been here once before for dinner (YUM!), but my sister was dying to try Brenda's so we came yesterday for brunch around 12pm. From a block away, I could already see the HOARDS of people swarming outside waiting for a table. Uh oh..then we went in and saw this horrific sight: http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. Blackboard FULL of names, so you know how popular this place is. After waiting almost an hour, the guy in charge of seating announced that there were some free spots at the counter with no wait, so we jumped at the chance. Who cares if it's the counter?? All I want is my food! Ambiance here is nice, great for a casual meal or a fancy dinner. The place is always buzzing and they have jazz-type music playing which livens things up, but makes it a little hard to hear when trying to have a conversation. What we ordered: - Beignet Flight ($9:50): one each of plain, chocolate, apple, crawfish) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Veggie Creole Omelette ($9.50): corn maque choux, tomato, onion, bell pepper, spinach, cheddar http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits ($12.75) - Watermelon Sweet Tea ($2.75): FREE REFILLS! The beignets came first and boy were they gooood. Plump, fluffy pillows covered in powdered sugar that came out to be bigger than I thought. I had half of the chocolate and apple, which were oozing with filling after being cut. The quality of chocolate they use must be good because it tasted so lusciously divine. The cinnamon-y apple filling was delicious as well. I felt like I was already starting to get full and the real meal hadn't even begun! I chose to get potato hash and a biscuit with my omelette. The biscuit came with a slice of butter on the side, but what I discovered was that eating the cheesy grits I stole from my sister WITH the biscuit made it taste 1000x more amazing. BRILLIANT INVENTION. I think the grits and biscuit were my favorite part of the meal! The potatoes looked like they had a cajun type seasoning and were very good. The omelette was full of vegetables and melted cheese (can't ever get enough cheese, right?), and the veggies were so delicious that I could just eat them on their own. I could only finish half the plate so I left with tons of leftovers. I really loved the watermelon sweet tea too. Brenda's offers free refills on coffee and tea, and our waitress came by to refill the sweet tea without me even asking! Great service. However, it tasted sort of different the second time (not as much watermelon flavor) and not as good as the first time, but oh well. Still worth it for the really good first glass! Sister was blown away by her pork belly dish and couldn't stop eating it as well. TIPS: COME EARLY because they don't take reservations and pair the cheesy grits with a biscuit!

I was super excited to try Brenda's out as the reviews on Yelp raaaaave about the food here.  Got here Saturday morning and the wait wasn't too bad, but the place was damn packed I have to say.   Ordered: Cafe au lait with soy milk - alright..  came in a huge cup and got me up & ready to seize the day. Crawfish beignets - crap load of bread.  Pretty much just ate the crawfish filling with tiny pieces of the beignet.  Wasn't bad, but also wasn't mind blowing as I had expected. Eggs benedict with catfish & side of grits - never having grits in my life before I wanted to know what it tasted like so I chose grits instead of the potatoes.  I have to say they were whatevs... buttery and creamy with the exception of the couple lumps I chewed on.  Eggs benedict was okay, hollandaise sauce had a kick to it, catfish was yummy, but like the beignet there was just way too much bread for me.  I ended up taking the biscuit off and just ate the eggs & catfish with lots of hot sauce.   Omelet with andouille sausage & potatoes - omelet was okay, the sausage was flavorful as were the potatoes. I don't know if it's just because my friend and I aren't huge fans of American style breakfasts, but it was just carb heaven not in a good way.  We left full, but not exactly satisfied.  I might have to go against the majority and say this place is pretty overrated and that I'd skip this place and save my calories for something worth the hype.   BUT... the service was great.

Okay so this is my review from the perspective of a frazzled mom who longs for the days where she can enjoy a nice relaxing brunch vs the one below from a carefree singleton! The hubby wanted to take a couple to this restaurant since we've raved about it for years and they had never tried it... but wait... what to do with the baby?  Is it worth risking the annoyed looks from neighboring tables just for a bite of their delectable, cheesy, fried goodness (aka crawfish beignet)?  Why yes it is!  So we work our little one's whole schedule around this and I send Ted over to put our names on the list so we don't have to wait in the cold with the baby.  He was told the wait would be 60-90 minutes so we pack up both the couple, the baby and a trunk full of baby accessories and get there in 50 minutes.  Get this... THEY HAD PASSED US UP!  and apparently the wait was now 2 hours.  What the heck? Here's the kicker.  When I ask the host how long it's been since they passed up our table, he looks down at the stroller and says, "long enough for you to have come back with a baby",  pivots and walks away.  For a second, I thought he was joking so I smiled but then I realized it was no joke since he didn't come back at all.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  So yes, this review is biased toward the awful host but Brenda's has enough good reviews for most people to get the message that yes, the food is good.  What people probably don't fully know is that apparently the service is getting quite up on themselves.   I was just pissed because we were going off of the host's guidance on timing to begin with and I guarantee you that at some point, they passed over someone else's name as they went to go get some Philz coffee around the corner and put them back at the front of the line.  And for those of you hipsters who are thinking so what?  That was me a year ago... you just have NO IDEA how frustrating this is...karma's a wench and your time will come...

What can I tell you new about a restaurant that has almost 2,500 reviews with a solid 4 star rating?  Nothing!!! I drove here for dinner on Tuesday night only to find out that they were closed...denied!  I checked the Yelp hours and it said that they were open on Wed from 5 to 10pm.  So just like Groundhogs Day I tried again on Wednesday and this time it was open. I walked in and put my name on the chalkboard...this is a cool concept...now you know exactly where you are on the list and it is public for everyone! I was seated very quickly which was great because all of the reviews talked about the long wait.  I decided that I did not want a full entree but would rather try a few items.  So I decided to start with a Crawfish Beignet, Onion Soup, Mac and Cheese and a piece of Fried Chicken. The Crawfish Beignet was so good...I honestly thought I was just going to take a bite but I could not stop and then it was gone...just a memory on my camera.  I have never had one of these and I do not even know if they are traditional but I do know that they are yummy.   The I moved on to the Onion Soup...the cheese on top was cooked perfectly...it was one of the best cheese tops I have ever had on an Onion Soup.  The soup itself was very good too but a little on the salty side...just be warned. Now it was time for Mac and Cheese...this is what I was looking forward to and I would say it was my least favorite.  It looked amazing but I really didnt enjoy it.  There was something mixed in with the cheese and the flavor was not working for me.  I think it might have been horseradish but I am not sure. The secret fried chicken recipe was just amazing!  It was one of the best fried chickens I have had in a while.  I was able to choose my piece of chicken and I went with a breast.  The meat was moist and tender and the outside was crunchy and spicy.  I was in love!  I am glad I only ordered one piece because if I had gotten the entree I would have devoured all three pieces. The interior was also really nice too...I loved the wall of mirrors...I wanted to do something like that on my bathroom wall...so glad to see my dreams come to life.  The staff was really good too...my waitress was from Illinois so we had that in common. I can hardly wait to be back in the area and have dinner here again!!!

This place is a taste for sore tongues!!!  I love this place so much that I wish I had a private jet to go there for 2-3 times a month for the Shrimp PoBoy and Crawfish beignets.  I stumbled upon Brenda's via Yelp and I read all the reviews that others posted.  I went to Benda's website and read the menu out loud to my boyfriend and he was hooked.  He mentioned that he wanted to eat something that was exclusive to San Francisco so we decided to visit.   There was definitely a line outside as the location is quite intimate.  I loved the chalkboard waiting list.  You walk in write your name and party size and then you wait.  BUT I PROMISE IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!! My boyfriend ordered the Hangtown Fry and was definitely pleased.  He added shrimp to it because he is a seafood lover.  He especially enjoyed the homemade biscuits.  He is still ranting and raving about them today and we have been home a week.   CRAWFISH BEIGNETS are amazing!!!  They were even good then next day with a little microwave heat.  They don't sound like something you would want to try but they are FABULOUS!!! YOU MUST ORDER A SERVING (3 per serving.....and they are huge!) Brenda's is must for every single visit to San Francisco.  Trust me you won't be disappointed. 4 stars because the tables are small and we were a little too close to the party next to us, and our server could've smiled a little more.

Amazing food!  We were visiting from New Mexico and were referred to this place for breakfast by one of the helpful people at the Phoenix Hotel down the street.  I had some cajun style omlette and it totally did remind me of being back in New Orleans.  My companions had the bignets and were also pretty impressed.  I'm putting this restaurant on my list of must visit places for any future visits.

At the suggestion of a friend, found my way here as my last food stop before heading back to So Cal. This was a great way to wrap up my trip and a reminder that SF food is simply one of a kind. Thinking that the wait would be ridiculous for Mother's Day, it actually wasn't that bad. Got there at 8:45 and was seated around 9:10 (party of 2, and I guess a wave of customers were just leaving). I tried the flight of beignets which is basically like a fried donut with goodies inside. I the flight comes with 4 and I would rank them like so: 1- plain 2- crawfish 3- apple 4- chocolate - this one just didn't do it for me... I got the sandwich that looks like it's dipped in egg, fried and topped with melted cheese. I can't say the name but it's on the menu if you looked. It reminded me of a ham croissant sandwich if it was deep fried? The french fries that came with it were great, cooked perfectly, and the cut was exactly how I like it. The pickled watermelon was a nice touch. The start of the meal was probably the catfish eggs benedict. You can actually appreciate the taste of the catfish, and the biscuit is just a great mixture of fluffy and crisp. Hollandaise... mmm! I would get this again in a heartbeat. These came with their potatoes which were just alright. The only regret: not getting a dish that had grits in it. I felt like every table either got a benedict or the grits... I will make sure to add that to my list when I am back in table. It definitely is going to get a spot on my food itinerary in the future!

I am hooked.  I typically hate popular places with long lines, due to my aversion to standing in lines, especially in front of expensive-ish restaurants in the Tenderloin.   Though, the friendly service, delicious food and great ambiance has won me over.  I ordered the banana foster french toast and the house coffee with chicory.  My dining partner ordered the cheesy grits with pork belly and watermelon tea.  Everything we ordered was amazingly good. For next time I have my eye on the beignet sampler plate.  Can't wait.

I'm definitely a fan of the decor and the general vibe, but I think I ordered the wrong dish. It was some sort of egg sandwich with red sauce on it, if I remember correctly, and overall it was "meh". I would like to go back and try something else as I feel they have to have something on the menu that I would enjoy. Who doesn't love soul food?

Crawfish beignets... I dream about your hot spicy cheddary deliciousness on the regular. I've been here for brunch and dinner and both are awesome, totally worth the wait. You'll have left overs to take home too since the portions are so big - after brunch I was very thankful I didn't attempt to finish my hangtown fry, beignets, grits, fabulous coffee, biscuit etc in one sitting. I also love how they have it decorated inside, its surprising to walk in to such a cute spot in the TL.

I showed up around 11 on a Saturday hoping that there wouldn't be too bad of a line.  There was still a 45 minute wait.   Me and my friends started with the beignet sampler.  These are not like Cafe du Monde at all, but they are delicious in their own right.  My favorite was the chocolate followed by plain and then apple.  The shrimp one is good, but in a whole other category, it would be more at home on a dim sum cart than paired with breakfast pastries. The bloody Mary's  are good, I like the Cajun seasoned rim and the okra.   I had a item from the specials menu, braised pork benedict.  It was fantastic.  The pork itself was awesome, just bursting with flavor.  The sauce was fine, but I hardly even remember it, and the biscuit was very nice and fluffy.  I ordered it with grits.  I don't really like grits, but I thought this would be a good place to give it another try.  This was the best grits I  have ever had, but I still didn't really like it.   I topped it all off with a cup of coffee which was good. The service was friendly, and they handled being completely packed pretty well. This was the most satisfying soul food I've found outside of the South.

I think this place is also a bit overrated. It was a rainy day but the restaurant was still crowded during brunch time. We ordered the Crawfish Beignets, the Shrimp and Grit, and also the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette. My favorite was still the Crawfish Beignets...the inside filling was so good! Probably it's because I hate eating crawfishes if the skin's still there. The Shrimp and Grit was wayyy too filling. It has a lot of cheese and  eating half of it will probably get you full. It's not a bad dish, but it's too heavy for me. The Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette is okay, but the goat cheese was a little too overpowering. Overall, I will not come back here unless I am around the area...or maybe I'll try the other places around in look for better soul food.

Occasion: Brunch with Rich What I Had: Chicken, Sausage & Okra Gumbo ($7.25)   Food Review: I've had plenty of Creole gumbo in Louisiana, but this was my first time trying what I think was intended Cajun gumbo. Really it seemed to be a combination of Creole and Cajun styles as the soup's lighter color and consistency (meaning it had been cooked for less time) were that of Creole, but the use of poultry and  lack of seafood or tomatoes was characteristic of  Cajun gumbos. The okra thickener was great. Okra is a traditional gumbo ingredient that has become less popular with modern tastes, but to me it means authenticity. A little more cayenne pepper would've been nice! Service Review: As with most brunch places, Brenda's doesn't take reservations, so we had a bit of a wait. But service was good, and our food came out quickly. Venue Review: The restaurant has two different entrances, one for each of the partitioned areas. There are plenty of tables for groups of 2 or 4, but in addition to the wait, seating may be an issue for larger parties. Street parking was surprisingly easy (maybe I've been in LA too long). Overall Impression: Good gumbo at a reasonable price. I wouldn't come here with more than 2 people, but I'm glad we got to try the #1 most reviewed brunch place in SF. I'll have to come back for some of those crawfish beignets!

i am a fan of their beignets.... other items are solid, but not "i have to come back" good.  get their beignet flight, you will not regret it and in fact that may all you need because it is a lot of food.  tight place, tight tables, dont go there on a first date.  the wait wasnt bad  because they turn the tables very fast.

Starting the first day of 2012 right - a meal at Brenda's. Homegirls and I were already starvin' like marvin when we arrived at Brendas, only to find that there would be an hour wait ahead of us. This seems to be the average wait time, so get your name on the chalkboard they have inside and grab some Philz Coffee on Van Ness while you wait and people watch. Dude finally came out, "Annie, for 3". "Hallelujah, Hallelujah, RIGHT HERE!" Got in and the place was PACKED, but.. I liked it.  We cozzied up in our table and family styled the Crawfish Beignet, Shrimp and Girts, Eggs Benedict with the Fried Chicken along with a side of their cornbread.  We each also hollered at a cup of their Sweet Watermelon House Tea as well - comes with free refills so don't be shy about it and toss that water aside.  Our food took another 30 minutes or so to come but hey, what do you expect from a place that has an one hour wait OUTSIDE of the restaurant right? We dove right into the Eggs Benedict - off the heezy fo sheezyyy. Def. a must try at Brendas.  The Shrimp & Grits were next and it was pretty good, split 3 way that is. I don't know if I would be able to finish a whole bowl by myself - it just has that "I think I'm kind of tired of this taste now" taste. Cornbread was next to meet his little friends in tummy-ville.  Golfed that bad boy down REAL fast.  By now, we all realized that our eyes were more hungry that our stomach was and we just sat there.. looking at our fluffy brown pillow-like Crawfish Beignets. We knew we had 2 decisions, attempt to polish those babies off and suffer from being overly full and for food coma to hit hard OR bring them home and for them to be potentially less yummy than they were meant to be. Eff it, it's 2012, food coma it is. (Ended up not finishing mine cause I was just too damn full so I just ate all the crawfish stuffing and left the pouch of dough to stand alone) Had such an amazing time at Brendas - great food, great company. I'd totally recommend coming here at least once, even with the hour wait.  For the first timers, holler at Brenda's, second timers+, holler at their take out.

The Tenderloin hood is home to one of my favorite places in all of the city, a wonderful southern joint by the name of Brenda's, bringing a little bit of Louisiana to San Francisco. My southern brethren might condemn me for life for what I'm about to declare, but the 4.5 star Brenda's is the best Louisiana inspired food I've had outside of the state. Everything I've had is on point and reminds me of most things I've had in Louisiana. The red beans and rice with andouille sausage is outstanding. So good, so savory, the sausage is juicy and the soupiness of the kidney beans tastes just right with the rice. I also enjoy their hushpuppies and a killer gumbo consisting of okra, chicken, and sausage. Even the po-boys are fantastic, especially the oyster and catfish version. The crunch of the perfectly fried oysters with the soft French roll bread, make for a mouth watering bite. Throw in a side of fries and we're in business. Other entrees worth a try are the BFC (biscuits + fried chicken) and the shrimp and grits, a smooth and creamy concoction full of flavor. Brunch is my favorite meal of the day and Brenda's does it well. The andouille sausage and cheddar omelette is totally on point. While it's my favorite item for brunch, I can also vouch for their egg benedict, served with a creole hollandaise and grits or hash as well as their shrimp and goat cheese omelette. I don't even like French toast, but I'll happily eat the Brenda's version any day. The butter pecan sauce drizzled all over their cinnamon battered brioche is enough to make any breakfast lover swoon. Southern hospitality is alive and well here. The staff has always been uber friendly, enough to where I actually felt like I was down south. Prices are a little steep for southern food, $20-25 feels like a requirement for any appetizer + entree, with still some spare change left for tip. Their immense popularity has enabled 1 hour+ waits during the brunch weekend and it's even carried over to the week day lunch.  I tend to call in and pick my order up to avoid the lines and still get access to the food. Ever since their new renovation (now more spacious, cleaner, and group friendly), I thought it would aid the wait times but Brenda's has only become more of a household name. I am weary of their beignets from time to time, which are delicious (especially the crawfish one) but are a little doughy for my taste. Ultimately if you can stomach a decent wait in the name of superb Cajun-like cuisine that would do Louisiana proud, then Brenda's is the place to be.

Amazing food ever!!! First time trying soul food for breakfast. I had the oyster bacon omelette and watermelon ice tea and it was so good!! the prices are amazing, friendly staff, and clean restrooms. this is one of those restaurants that have a huge line out the door so i recommend like what we did was to show up 10 mins before they opened for breakfast and we were 2nd in line, around 9-930am the restaurant started to get full.

If I could just review them on the Crawfish Beignets and Creole Bloody Mary, it would have been 5 stars!!!  I like spicy, and both satisfied me on that front.  The Beignets were warm and dusted with enough creole pixie dust that you could have flown off your seat!  The crawfish and cheese combo inside oozed out as you dug your fork in.  So flavorful...that fish CRAY!!!  Don't lose the green onions on top, they add to the flavor blast! The bloody mary was also amazing, if I was with my heavy drinker friend, i might have had seconds!!! The rest of the food was okay.  I got the Pork Belly special, and I thought the pork was a little tough, and the skin on didn't really help the situation.  The bed of cheddar grits it was placed on was good.  Could have done without the relish. I had some of my friends Catfish benedict...it was good.  I think I need to try that for myself, a whole order.  The biscuits were huge, but flavor wise just okay.  Not as good as the biscuits at Iron Side. Overall I had a pleasant brunch here. The food I had was good, and there was so much more on the menu, I will definitely be back!

I didn't intend to come to this place but the Red Door Cafe was turning away patrons at 11am. So this was another recommendation from a friend and boy was I glad we came here. I am truly a fan! We got the flight of beignets and the shrimp and grits. We almost choose another item but luckily we didn't it was a lot of food. Not a fan of the chicory coffee a little too rooty for me. As for the flight of beignets loved the chocolate one! the plain was good throw some jam on it if you want to add some more flavor. The savory one was not bad and the apple eh... didn't care for it at all. The shrimp and grits was amazing. I loved the tomatoes on it, flavor was just in your face with each bite. It looks like a heart attack with extra cheese but the cheese was not too over powering and luckily didn't give me any issues (lactose intolerant).  I will definitely come back to try other items.

I miss New Orleans with all of the incredible soul food! Brenda's is a good alternative if one cannot travel to NOLA. Compared to NOLA food, Brenda's is a lot healthier - less cream/rich flavors and less salty. Crawfish beignets were pretty good. The crawfish stuffing was tasty. We noticed that the dough for the beignets was denser compared to beignets in NOLA, so that was a minus. The sweet potato dumplings were delicious. I added crawfish and shrimp for an additional cost. I thought there could have been more dumplings since this dish seemed a little costly with the added seafood. The shrimps and grits was a recommendation from the waitress. If you like cheese, this dish is perfect for you. As for dessert, we got the sampler beignets - plain, chocolate, and apple. Plain was not good. It was not the same as Café du Monde. The texture was crunchy and doughy. Chocolate was a little too much. I liked apple since it was like eating an apple pie. The tables are close together, so you can hear your neighbor's conversation. Just a FYI in case you have an intimate conversation.   Dinner was around $50 for two people.

****This review is for the breakfast only!!! I had the dinner and it was 2.5 stars at best*** YUUUUUUUUM! First off: Plans to spend about an hour waiting for a table. We went on Sunday Morning at 11AM and got a table at about 12:30. I ordered the Eggs Benedict on Cream Biscuit with fried chicken and grits. Now I think it is the 8th deadly sin to eat eggs with chicken, but surprisingly this combination worked quite well. The Eggs Benedict was very fluffy and the hollandaise sauce was nice as well. I frankly could have skipped the egg and had the fried chicken with hollandaise and biscuits. The grits were thick and creamy. Very well done. Not too buttery and with the right amount of lumps. The husband ordered the House-made Granola Pancakes with fresh fruit and vanilla bean spread. The fruit was fresh and sweet. The pancakes were as big as my head, so we ended up taking them to go. For drinks we had the mocha (A+ just as good as the Tcho Mocha at Blue Bottle) and the iced tea. Once I added about 4 ounces of sugar to the unsweetened tea, it was just as good as the tea in Mississippi. Also we had the Granny Smith beignets. STOP RIGHT THERE! I had never had beignets, (because they sold out too quickly in New Orleans) and these beignets made me feel like I was in the movie "The Princess and the Frog". They were so big and covered with so much powdered sugar that I almost ate an entire beignet, and this was before the rest of the food came. I would recommend ordering this to arrive after your meal or else you will ruin your appetite. Overall: Food: 5 Stars Atmosphere: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Price: BANG BANG for your buck I am satisfied

I tried really hard to like Brenda's. 4 stars - 2600 reviews?! Brenda is bigger than most breakfast/brunch places so the line moved quickly. We ordered the beignets after seeing a million pictures of them on yelp. The one filled with apple tasted like a Mcdonalds apple pie (which I like).  However, the pies at Micky D's taste better and you could get 12 for the same price. Brenda's is more quantity over quality. They also seem to be inconsistent with their product. My croque looked different than the party next to me, and food pictures of the same dishes looked slightly different from each other. Service was inconsistent too. We were asked by 3 different servers if we were ready to order within seconds apart.

My wife and I went here for lunch with a friend on kind of a whim.  We looked at all the reviews and I wasn't sure what to expect.  If you just looked at the outside and what the neighborhood looks like you wouldn't expect such a nice place inside. When you come inside you put your name and the number in your party on a chalkboard.  I think it's a pretty cool idea because you in theory know where you are on the list.  I say in theory because we were about number four on the list and thought we would have a bit of a wait.  We ended up being called being called next because we were the only party larger than two. I thought the place was nice, but the food was terrific.  First, the menu had a lot of great choices and they had some interesting specials.  We got an order of the Hushpuppies and they were some of the best I've had.  I decided to get the Chicken Etouffee because it was one of the few times I've seen it without seafood.  It was great!  Our friend had the fried chicken and said it was quite good.  My wife had the Home Fry Omelet and she said it wonderful.  I think Brenda's may be one of our new favorites in town. The only down side I can say is that it's not exactly cheap for an everyday lunch place.  Given the uniqueness and quality of the food I'd say it's definitely worth every penny and we'll definitely be going back to try some of the other things on the menu.  One thing we saw on a lot of other tables that looked great was the Beignets and next time we go we'll have to give them a try.

4 words: Crawfish Beignets, 'nuff said After having dined here before on a previous trip. We decided that the crawfish beignets alone was worth the visit again. Although they serve up other delicious soul food flavors, it really doesn't justify a 1hr+ wait for brunch, no place does really... This time we smartened up, we put our order in for beignets to go, walked around the corner to Philz and came back to to our piping hot beignets waiting for us in a to-go bag. We were right, the beignets did not let us down and more importantly we had the joy of watching other diners waiting in line suffer while we enjoyed our beignets right in front of them.

Crawfish Beignets Oyster Flight - So fresh! Hushpuppies Fried Green Tomatoes Shrimp and Grits - A little oily but so much flavor! I normally don't like grits but I guess when they're made right, they're mouth watering! BBQ Pork Ribs - Tender and tasty! Catfish Po'boy - Good, but nothing REALLY special. Brenda's Fried Chicken - Juiciest and crispiest fried chicken I've ever had! The service was friendly and prices were good. This is a place where I'll definitely be back!

The BEST meal I have had in SF so far. Hands Down The wait to get seated was 1 hour long, which I thought wasn't bad, because while waiting, I talked to some people who said the wait time could easily get up to 2-3 hours long. The number of people you come with obviously affects how long your wait time is. Groups of 2 were being seated significantly quicker than groups of 6-8. A quick way to kill the time while waiting is to head over to Philz and pick up a coffee. However, be prepared to WAIT at Philz Coffee as well. Now to the food! We shared a Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict (2) with potatoes on the side and Crawfish Beignet (3). The Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict was my favorite out of the two and here is why: The sauce that they glaze on top of it was superb. I didn't take the time to figure out what the sauce was exactly because I was too busy enjoying the food. All I know is that the sauce is orange. The catfish was small because it had to fit on top of the Benedict, but don't let the small size fool you; it is packed with flavor. Make sure you have a piece of fried catfish with each bite of your Benedict. It will make your meal unforgettable. The Crawfish Beignet were huge! I have had sweet Beignets from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans so I was not sure what to expect with Crawfish inside of this one. The first bite I took, I was not able to get to the crawfish but I was still extremely satisfied with the Beignet already! The deep fried dough tasted so good! Once I got to the Crawfish, it got even better. The melted cheddar cheese inside blended with the crunchy outside perfectly. The top of the beignet was sprinkled with some sort of red pepper seasoning which gave it a little spicy kick. I do not remember anything else that happened at Brenda's because I was too entranced by the food. I could not comment on how the service was or what the ambiance of the place is like.

This has become one of my favorite restaurants  in SF! Well... more like breakfast spot :) 1. Biscuits are HEAVEN! Truly delicious. I love the feeling in my mouth and taste on my tongue. It's so fluffy, flakey, divine! Always order one to go! 2. AMAZING BRUNCH PLACE! It gets a little busy, but the wait is worth it. I suggest going as early as you can so you won't have to wait. Brunch is on weekends from 8am-3pm. 3. They have options of ordering half an entree like french toast and homemade granola pancakes. Less calories and save money! This is what I have had there: VEGGIE CREOLE OMELETTE  (Corn maque choux, tomato, onion, bell pepper, spinach cheddar) I ordered this with egg whites because I don't like yolk. I chose the potato hash over the grits and biscuits over toast (always at Brenda's!). The potato hash has some really good spices on it with a nice little crunch. Very savory and goes well with the omelette. I ordered this dish thinking it would be different from your usual vegetarian omelette, but there was nothing that special about it and tasted like any other omelette. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean it wasn't delicious because IT WAS... but I just wanted something that would distinguish it from others. FRENCH TOAST (Half-Order) You get three triangle slices, good enough for a meal if you are watching your calories. This french toast is battered with cinnamon, and I noticed they add some of their homemade granola (yum - esp. with the pancake). HOUSEMADE GRANOLA PANCAKE WITH FRUITS (Half-Order) You get one granola pancake with a variety of fruit on top, drizzled with vanilla bean cream. Honestly, I am not a pancake person, but when I had this... it all changed. This is the one place where I can actually enjoy and love a pancake. The granola gives it a nutty, crispy, crunch! The fruit goes well with the pancake, adding some sweetness to it with the vanilla bean cream. I highly suggest trying this or even getting it as a dessert! CHOCOLATE BEIGNET This is such a good deal. You get three, HUGE, filled, powdered beignets! They are really thick, sweet, and donuty. I prefer them hot and fresh. The chocolate in the middle is slightly melted and oozes its way to your mouth with every bite. They are delicious but very heavy and I was only able to eat half in one sitting. Now that I have gone to Brenda's, twice for brunch... I think it's time for me to try their lunch and dinner!

Great city environment. Restaurant is always packed but once you are seated the service is fast. Bring a pillow because after eating the great food here you will need a nap.

Brenda's is an excellent choice for a casual dining experience with close friends.  A group of 6 of us went to Brenda's on a Sunday evening and all left in foodie bliss. Highlights: Crawfish Beignet Shrimp Po' Boy Mac and cheese Gumbo The bill for 6 of us came to $100.  Great food and great company.  Cant beat that!

Holy moly! Thank the lord my cousin is a local of SF or else I would have probably never found this soul food gem on my own. Brenda's is amazing whether you be a local or a tourist. Being my first time in SF I wanted to make sure I tried the BEST places in SF and viola... this was one of them. It was my last day in SF and my cousin suggested this place. We took the muni from Haight-Ashbury and walked a mile to this place and it was PACKED! Apparently the word has gotten out about Brendas. Luckily my cousin had put our name down so we got seated about 15 mins after we got there. (*Love how you scribble your name & # of your party on a chalkboard) Everything we had was amazing. GET THE BEIGNET FLIGHT! Words can't describe how delicious they all were. I'm small... my stomach is small.... I had 1 1/2 of these with a cup of coffee before we got out meal and I was full! I only managed to eat half of my actual breakfast but it was still good. & how can I resist a biscuit with my breakfast, yum! My cousin got the shrimp & grits which was heavenly too. I feel like I could write a novel describing the food but i'll try and keep it short. It's definitely busy ALL the time so don't come  here starving because you will have to wait a bit. It's also a big snug, so don't come here with personal space issues either. Be friendly & don't be a pain in the ass. The servers are hustling and bustling around this place which I appreciate. There is nothing that irritates me more than lazy employees in a fast paced enviornment. I've worked in the food industry forever and know how crazy it gets. I will be coming back to Brenda's the next time I head up to SF. Please do me a favor & try this place out!

My friend & I came here on a Tuesday, right before noon and there was no line! We got seated right away and got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. I hate waiting for food so this was definitely a great and quick experience. I ordered the Hangtown Fry with hash and biscuit and a watermelon ice tea. At first I thought the iced tea was weird, but it actually tastes really good. My omelette with fried oysters & green onion was amazing! And the biscuit is to-die-for. Everything I had was great and I'm pretty impressed with this spot. I should've tried it a long time ago but never got the chance. Now i know why my friends keep raving about it. The only thing I didn't like is the neighborhood it's in, and the parking, of course. But the restaurant itself deserves 5 stars.

OVERRATED. Except the crawfish beignets which DO deserve 4 stars. Very delicious.. nice pieces of crawfish you can actually see and taste and a creamy filling. We each ordered a watermelon iced tea. This I really liked but seemed like I was just drinking blended watermelon juice that I could make at home... it is bottomless, so you know I drank my money's worth. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp and Grits and a piece of the BFC fried chicken (thigh). The shrimp and grits were extremely cheesy. Sort of hard to eat when the cheese is everywhere and the sauce got overwhelming quick. The flavor and everything was good for about the first 5 minutes then I got tired of it. It might be a dish you want to share with another person because we both only ate about half of our own dish. The BFC fried chicken wasn't that great... I've had better at Popeyes. The texture was very homemade which was nice but the chicken itself lacked flavor and was bland. The other two had the andouille sausage omelette with a biscuit and potatoes and the hangtown fry. Both were okay..... average omelette and scramble type dish with minimal flavor in my own opinion. Everything sort of lacked in flavor and all four of us agreed. The wait wasn't too long for a Friday and that we liked a lot.. we waited 10 minutes max (this was around 1PM). The staff was friendly, patient and helpful and kept the glasses filled which was nice.

yum yum! I came here with a gf for a late weekend lunch. Granted it was past 1pm and there was still a HUGE crowd outside waiting for a table. We parked ourselves on a couple stools and waited. I think we waited about 30 minutes before we were seated - hooray! I must say the tables are placed thisclose to your neighbor. So if you have gossip that you don't want others to hear maybe another restaurant choice is best suited. We ordered: -Crawfish beignet (they just ran out of their special dungeness crab beignet before we were seated) - Catfish po'boy -fried chicken benedict -half order of the stuffed french toast with blueberries on top I've never been there so I definitely wanted to "sample" all that Brenda's had to offer. I have to admit i was full after eating the beignet (three to an order and those suckers are bigger than my hand) but pressed onward to eat everything else we had ordered. I really really like my catfish po'boy and fries, loved the fried chicken and especially the biscuit from the benedict and really really liked the french toast...oh gosh, i loved all the food!! I will definitely be back when the fat kid in me needs to be let out (oh wait thats all the time so i think i'll be back frequently heehehe)..... Tips: --Write your name on the chalkboard to the right when you enter --Enjoy the neighbors around you and make friends  :)

This place is just a-okay. I have been here twice, before and after the remodeling, and both times have been just a-okay. It's not great, and I leave disappointed and confused about the hype. The only good thing about the remodel is that this restaurant no longer has a wait! There were a few empty tables on a Thursday night at around 7pm. I am pretty sure that I only like their crawfish beignet and oysters. The rest of their food, I am either indifferent about or detest them. Their po-boy tastes like a fancy In-n-Out burger due to the thousand island dressing, and I had much better baby-back ribs before. I will prob never come back here again unless I am dragged into the TL again and have no one to walk me back to a safety zone.

So let me just start out by saying that the only reason they didnt get 5 stars was because of the huge wait.  Its a small place, and we waited about an hour on a Sunday morning.  I guess that really is to be expected. Aside from that, the food was YUM YUM YUM Really, as good as it gets.  Fantastic brunch.  I was soooooo stuffed, and I just wanted to try more more more.

SOMEHOW, I feel like this place is being too hyped about. I came here expecting too much the taste of the food in Brenda's is okay, but not amazing. Came here for Brunch with a friend at around 1 pm on a saturday. The moment I step in Brenda, I must say I was captured with the french soul vibe of the restaurant. It really does gave me the feel of a southern restaurant. I must say, come here pretty early it is always PACKED. Luckily, we came here pretty early so it wasnt that crowded. We waited for about 15 minutes and then were served right away. We ordered: -Beignet Flight- which is basically we got to try every flavor of the beignets. This was the highlight of the place. The reviews complimenting the flavor of the beignets were up to its expectations. My favorites the chocolate flavor and the crawfish. Absolutely divine....the choco flavor were sweet on the inside and crispy on the outside....YUMM -BFC-Uh this wasnt as i expected to, the chicken was too oily and crispy to my liking. So I was really disappointed about that from Brenda's. -Watermelon Iced Tea-HONESTLY, its a normal iced tea with a hint of watermelon in it. It was just a normal iced tea. BUT, you get free refills so YAY In the end, I find the place decent, It had a great ambiance, great service, but the overall food was just decent. Hence, i am giving it 3 stars.

I have been wanting to go here for two years and it was so worth the wait.  The food was incredible.  Beignet Flight was delicious.  I absolutely loved the crawfish beignets.  It was the perfect blend of tastes and textures.  Also had the shrimp Po'Boy and it was great.  Huge order and the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  The sauce was great and the bread was perfect.  All my friends loved the restaurant and I got kuddos for picking it out.  It's a definite must!

Update: so I've recently read all the other reviews and I'm absolutely blown away by how many people love the food here. I grew up on soul food, specifically my mom was born and raised in New Orleans and I swear on my life either they were having a very off day or their food is bad. It was bland American food pretending to be soul food. There was absolutely no soul in the food. I love good food and love to recommend good places, this honestly just was not one. I can't even explain the drastic difference from other people's experience and that of me and my family. I know a lot of people will continue to wait in the line and if you do I pray you have a better experience than we did. Old post: I would give 0 stars if it weren't for the service. The waitresses were really awesome. The food was horrible. My bacon was burnt to the point you couldn't eat it. The grits tasted like farina (don't ask me how I know this). The beignets were a catastrophe. A big bundle of dough with unsweetened powder sugar on it. My eggs were overcooked with unmelted cheese on top. I could go on but won't. I always wanted to come I this place because of the extremely long lines outside, but it was a waste of 55.00 (3 people) for breakfast. However, the staff (minus the hostess) were extremely nice. I almost feel bad writing a bad review. But my review is for food not staff. Oh the decor was nice. I'm sorry to say, but this is an emphatic NO! Don't get caught up looking at the line. Maybe next time I go I should pay more attention to who is in line.

Brenda's French Soul Food So...I finally made my way here to Brenda's French Soul Food.  Drove by and just happen to find a parking space right in front of the establishment.  Since it was Sunday parking is free. There is a line....woooo....Ok....let's see if I can deal with this.  I went to check how long the wait would be ...ummm ....about half an hour ....ok...I can deal with that....so my name was added to the list. Waited about 15 - 20 minutes and my name was called.  We were seated.  Orange Juice and Watermelon Tea please.  Menu....check... Decision making time... Flight Beignets Pork Belly Special Fried Chicken Benedict So we started with the Flight Beignets.  This was a sample of all 4 flavors they serve.  The flavors were:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Plain Beignet - Tasty, but not the best I've had...4 Stars Granny Smith Apple w/ Cinnamon Honey Butter - Not bad, could have had a little more Cinnamon...4 Stars Ghiradelli Chocolate - Nice Chocolate taste...a good mix. Crawfish w/cayenne, scallions & cheddar - Very tasty...this one is a Must Try!! Overall Beignets were a solid 4 stars. Then the Fried Chicken Benedict and the Pork Belly Special came. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The Fried Chicken Benedict was some what a disappointment, but made up with it's flavor. A Cream Biscuit topped with two Poached Eggs, Fried Chicken and creole hollandaise (sauce, a mixture of Egg yolks, lemon, salt, pepper and melted butter with a side of Baked Potatoes.   This was very flavorful and tasty.  The Fried Chicken was not as tender that I was looking forward to (that's the disappointing part.)  The Poached Eggs....kind of wished there was more yolk to leak out, but good enough.  The Cream Biscuit was ok.  The Baked Potatoes were tasty and flavorful, Ketchup was not required, but you have the option to add if you desire.  Overall the flavor of this dish makes up for the flaws (or dislikes) I had mentioned.  - 4 star dish. The Pork Belly Special http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Pork Belly and cheddar grits Pork was a little salty and a little fatty, but as expected. The Cheddar Grits was very good and tasty. Overall - A 4 Star Dish. Watermelon Tea Drink - Tasty - Got to try it. Orange - Nice and smooth, not too sweet. Beignets are good, don't let it get cold. Fried Chicken Benedict, nice and flavorful. Pork Belly special is good. None of the dishes needed additional ingredients.  Fine the way it is unless you like it a little spicy.  No Ketchup required. Ambiance - Nice and Cozy. Service - Our Server was very nice and helpful.  Kept an eye on us to make sure everything was up to snuff.  We received our check in a timely manor. Bathroom - clean. Will return for more. Overall a solid 4 Star.

Wanted to find a place to brunch on a Friday afternoon and Brenda's was definitely my number one choice! Even on a Friday around 11:30am there was still about a 20-30 minute wait - this place is pretty tiny! Just be sure to go into the restaurant and put your name down on the huge chalkboard. The bf and I absolutely had to split the beignet flight. The beignets were sooo good.  The bf's favorite was the crayfish one which was a little bit on the spicy side.  The apple beignet was my favorite of the trio.  I had a watermelon sweet tea and two scrambled eggs with homefries and a biscuit. Everything was super yummy and the biscuit was deliciously buttery and crumbly. A nice treat every once and awhile if you're willing to wait.

I would like to give a shout out to the crawfish beignets!  YUMMY!  The only thing is, is, they give you three huge ones in an order, and to have room for the other delights here, you kind of need to split one and take the rest home...I say this as truth.  I can eat a lot, trust me, and had no room in the tum, barely, after a whole one.  Please do not let this dissuade you from ordering the plate of three.   I had the fried chicken benedict and my friend had the catfish benedict.  it was served on a biscuit instead of an english muffin, and that was tasty.  The hollandaise sauce is divine.  They have real deal coffee and chicory.  The service is nice here. T-a-s-t-y!

Came here on a Sunday night right before closing so didn't have to deal with the line...score! Although on Sunday nights they don't offer their full dinner menu, but instead have brunch all day and some items off the main menu. The service was great and friendly. We ordered the crawfish beignets to start and I will take 1 star off my review because they were not heated all the way through. Probably because we came late and they were not freshly fried but still...a few more minutes in the oven and they would have been fine. They weren't my favorite tho, again probably because we came before closing. Now on to the main course...we had the shrimp po'boy and the shrimp with grits. Both were REALLY great...but I must say just thinking about the po'boy right now is making me drool...it was so delicious! The decor also made me feel like I was back in New Orleans with the mirrors, tiled ceiling and wood work. I can't wait to try this place again but I sure as hell would pass it up if there were 20 people in line like some reviews say.

Got here around 9:20am for breakfast with one of my girlfriends and thank god we did because the line just kept growing after that. The wait was about 5-10mins. THE FOOD IS SO BOMB! I will definitely come back to try all the pulled pork w. grits. Everyone seems to be getting it. For the two of us we got: beignet flight - MUST TRY! if u like savory the crawfish is definitely the way to go. i have never had beignets before and i must say if they all taste like this i've been missing out big time! every bite was so flavorful and it was fried so perfectly. So fluffy and delicious! If you want sweet I would suggest the chocolate one, I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Gooey chocolateness yum! Again it was so hot with every bite it's amazing. The plain one was better than the apple cinnamon one. But I'll settle for anything if I didn't get to chose. hahah everything is so good. french toast with pecan syrup - OMG yummy! the best sauce ever. pecans were delicious and the toast was perfect! Hangtown fry- OYSTERS were fatty and crispy on the outside. the biscuit was soo flaky, no need for butter, it was delicious all on its own. the hash was okay but everything else just made up for it. HIGHLY recommend this place if you're looking for delicious soul food!

Where to begin - their "snacks" menu from 3-5pm is GREAT!  You can relax and sample a variety of tasty treats at super fair prices.  This is a great way to hook us into becoming repeat customers - no problemo there! For starters we were treated to pork rillettes and some savory crawfish beignets.  I'll get the rillettes out of the way - first, I would bet not everyone is a fan of rillettes - you have to suspend dietary sanity before enjoying.  These were no exception and they sported the only kitchen slip in the tasting... my wife asked "what's the spice?" and my answer was, "dust? or mold?".  Well at least that helped her put a skewer in the slight overexuberance with the file.  So let's move on, the three *huge* (about the size of a baseball!) crawfish beignets were generously filled with a savory crawfish and cheese concoction.  Oh you could make a delightful meal with these along, actually probably need to box some up. We also tried the catfish po-boy - perfect remoulade, perfectly fried catfish, nice bun and fixins', all yumm-goodly.  Served with a refreshing coleslaw - no mayo in sight, slightly salty, slightly acidic, actually haunting and hard to leave alone. The weightlifter selection is shrimp and grits.  Creamy creamy grits with lotsa cheese just like down south. Sweet tomatoey sauce and plump just-right shrimp in shell.  Some nice bits of sausage rounded it out.  This would be a great lunch if you are capable of staying awake after so much caloric enjoyment. The rillettes and the po-boy came with homemade watermelon pickles, a nice touch.  Not too sweet, more pickly.  I liked 'em.  The other watermelon homage, the house ice tea, incorporated a lot of watermelon and flavor and was worth trying.  But I'll go back to something with a little more acid in it to cleanse the palate next time I try Brendas.   If you are pining for Nawlins or points south in San Francisco, Brenda's will treat you right.

Ok I'm super ambivalent about this place for the mere fact that we had two servers.   When we walked in felt unwelcomed.  They asked us to read the menu prior to eating there because they were transitioning from Lunch to dinner.  Not even a hi hello bla bla bla.  We seat anyways because of the beignet.  I love me some beignet. We had the Sample Beignet and they are frikking huge!  You have to eat them right away because the dough gets hard and then it's not good anymore. There were 4 of us that were going to order, the server didn't even say hi she just asked if we were ready. FINE WE ARE!  So three of us ordered, and the fourth person ordered another beignet, we told him not to because they're huge, and then he took maybe 10 seconds to decide that he wasn't going to order.  I'm an observer of "eye rolling servers" and she most certainly did. The other server stopped by to make sure we were attended to and she made sure our drinks orders were taken care of and made sure that we were comfortable. We'll name here Server awesome and the other the other server. So we all got our food, and server awesome was refilling our drinks.  My bf accidentally tipped his plate over his lap and most of his meal went on the floor.  As this was happening, I see the other server cleaning up another table and stopped and stared at our table and sighed.  She then continues to clean up that table and then grabbed roll of toilet paper and handed it to us.  Server Awesome comes to the rescue, helps us clean the mess up and orders my bf another meal without any charge! I have to say the food was hella good.  I had their Shrimp Risotto.  It is kind of too oily and you can see the oil sitting on top.  So yeah... That's my experience at Brenda's.

Really good food. The biscuits are soooo yummy. They have a long wait during the busiest parts of the day though so go well before you are starving. They seem to be struggling a little bit with figuring out how to accommodate the large numbers of people who want to eat there. The restaurant is small and a little cramped and service can lag a bit at times when they are super busy. Probably best to go when they're less busy.

Upon mentioning that I would be heading to San Fran for the weekend, Trina D's only comment to me was, "Are you going to Brenda's?" to which I replied: "My personal life is none of your business."   Fortunately for me, Brenda's happened to be within walking distance of my spot, and we were able to effortlessly find a seat as it was midday on a Tuesday, and the renovation has been completed.  There are quite a lot of tables, and although the decor is a bit bland, the food certainly was not. Our service overall was good, our food came out fast, and our drink orders were filled quickly.  I ordered the watermelon iced tea which was balanced well with just enough pulp to still be make it an iced tea, and not a smoothie.   We shared the beignet flight, and I had the Shrimp Po'boy.   The Beignet flight had a lot going on.  I actually felt bad for the regular beignet, like it was the runt of the family who got no attention and was always left behind.  The chocolate beignet was like the overly done up cheerleader, presumably tasty, but slightly overpowering.  The apple beignet was the normal looking "girl next door" beignet, sweet, and full of depth, and the crawfish beignet was the sports superstar, packed full of flavor and slamdunks of flavor.   Leaving only the normal beignet, who may excel in a lesser family, but in this flight, he was just left hopelessly behind.  He sat nibbled on, but almost wholly uneaten.   (http://www.yelp.com/user…)   My sandwich was unabashedly delicious.  The bread was crispy and basically doused in butter, the shrimp was perfectly breaded and crispy, yet full of flavor, and the sauce played into the dish as a whole, adding a great blend of flavors.  The slaw was also flavorful and crispy.  I got two meals out of that one.   http://www.yelp.com/user… All said, we got a great meal for about $20 bucks each.   I can't really find anything wrong with Brenda's.  And while I may be the normal beignet of the bunch, I certainly didn't eat like one on this day.   5 stars!

Get here at 7:40 am and there is absolutely no line!   It is great to be first we didn't have to write our names on the chalkboard door which serves as their waiting list. They open at 8:00 am... I felt like I was in a commercial, open, open, open... Within 15 minutes, the restaurant was almost filled to capacity - a true hidden gem in the Tenderloin District. We stayed at the Hyatt Embarcadero and walked the 1 3/4 mile to get here in order to  devoure what we wanted guilt free! It worked.  We started off with two cappuccino's at $3.25 each. I ordered the special- Crispy Pork Belly http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - cheddar grits, poached egg, and spicy onion polish - $12.75. The Crispy Pork Belly was just fabulous! Sitting regally on top of the cheddar grits, poached egg and spicy onion polish. Poached egg on top of anything is just fine by me, but on  top of the cheddar grits? Holy cow, the flavors and texture worked well together to make my mouth VERY happy!  Now add a little of the pork belly and a little of the onion polish, a match made in heaven!  My plate was void of any leftovers I am proud to say. Hubby ordered the Hangtown Fry http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Crispy Oyster, bacon & scallion scramble. With grits and a cream biscuit - $11.00. Oh my, this scramble was so delish with the crispy oysters! Never had a scramble quite like this. Who knew bacon worked so well with crispy oysters? But then again, who knew bacon was good in chocolate?  The grits were great, no cheese, just grits. The biscuit was very good with the pumpkin marmalade. Well, the little piece I was given was good... I love my husband dearly, but I can see after being together over 20 years, he is becoming more and more possessive of his entrees when they are just delectable! We then asked for an order of Crawfish beignet and I did not realize the word was plural, as in three! The waitress suggested the special beignet we could order by itself, however it is sweet. And we both did not want a sweet beignet. She kindly made an exception and we were able to order just the one. Single crawfish beignet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - $2.95. The huge beignet came out first and it was delish!  Perfectly fried and upon opening this beautiful creation, it oozed it's wonderful crawfish goodness... We were in heaven. Perfect with the cappuccino! A short lull and another waiter came by and asked if we needed something else to drink and my hubby ordered the Creole Bloody Mary http://www.yelp.com/biz_….  Loved the pepper instead of the normal celery. Food - 5 Stars Service - 5 Stars - loved the very attentive staff! Ambiance - 5 Stars - love the brick walls, mural and the lovely mirrors.

People warned me about the hour wait, but sometime you just want to believe that you're special, and there won't be a line when you get there, but nope....one hour wait.  Don't let the wait scare you off though, it's just ALL part of the Brenda's experience. In a city like sf, and in a neighborhood such as TL, there is never a dull minute.  The sun was shining, i was with my catty sistas from anotha mistas.....the perfect combo to people watch.  The highlights of our fashion police-ing goes to a sista who looked like she clipped on a hot pink track [weave in layman's terms] she picked up off the street to her forehead, a brotha who looked like Anthony hamiliton with a fancy schmancy pants, & neon socks and shoelaces swag, and a girl whose outfit would put the rainbow to shame. We had already decided to family style the dishes here.  Our bill came out to be $45 dollars, a pretty good price based on the fact that I did not need another meal for the rest of the day after eating here.  In the order of deliciousness, this is what we stuffed in our bellays: - Egg benedicts with fried chicken and potatoes BEST POACHED EGGS I HAVE EVER HAD. I giggled like a little girl when I saw the yolk ooze out as I took my first bite.  I would come back and wait in hour JUST for this dish.  There was nothing too special about the potatoes on the side. - Cornbread Th 4 dolla price tag definitely deterred me for a bit, but it  lived up to its price.  Flaky, moist, and just plain delicious. - Shrimp and Grits This dish had a very rich flavor.  A  plate that should be shared because I can imagine getting tired of the same taste if I had my own bowl.  The texture kind of reminded me of Chinese congee, but with cheddar and small chunks of sweet tomatoes. - Crawfish Beignet a pillow of yumminess but by the time I got to this dish, I was so full that I felt that i did not really get to enjoy it.  I just spooned the inside and left all the dough. - Sweet watermelon iced tea The tea is so authentic that I had leaves and even a BRANCH in my tea.  Other than that, it really wasn't even that sweet.  It has more of a tea taste.  You can taste little pulps of watermelon and they throw in slices of watermelon rinds in there. ***Helpful Hint*** Come on a sunday when the meters are free!  The 6 dollar meter fee could cost you more than a cornbread, and you would rather feed yourself than the meter, right?

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I *heart* soul food.  And Brenda's is straight up legit.  I've been here twice in the past few months and the wait was never really a problem.  Both times our wait times were under 10 minutes. The Grits = "I die" moments.  (It was even better the next morning since I took part of it to go) Sweet potato dumplings are really light and great for those who don't want a heavy meal. The staff is really friendly, and the ambiance was really cool (I'm all about the ambiance).  Even though our group of friends laughed extremely loudly and made really unfunny jokes related to our classes and the law, no one gave us weird looks or made us feel out of place. This place is great to hang with friends and cool enough to take your lady love out on a date.  And of course, the food is amaze-balls!!!!

Bravo Brenda! Bravo... i ordered the crispy pork belly for brunch and at one point after taking a bite of the pork belly i just stood up and started clapping, IT WAS THAT GOOD!!! The pork was cooked-fried to perfection, the grits and cheese suffocating the pork belly was terrific, the egg swimming in the grits was complimentary and the sweet onion/tomato drizzled on top of it all put it over the top! i also had some biscuits on the side which i occasionally used as a spoon to capture all the flavors of the dish! one of THE BEST breakfast i have had! as an appetizer we also ordered the crawfish beignets and it was good too, but i think next time i will try one with some fruit in the middle for desert. Aside from the food, the service was great except for the wait which was somewhere around an hour; but with fantastic tasting food like they have here, the wait is a small factor.

Located right on the edge of the Civic Center district, Brenda's was completely worth the trip. The place itself is nice and bright, and the servers were all attentive and friendly. We started with the beignet flight (apple-, chocolate-, and crawfish-stuffed beignets along with a plain one) which could have been a meal all unto itself. To stop there would have been a travesty, as the food was superb. Everything on the menu looked great, and the specials board made deciding what to get even harder. I ended up getting the eggs Benedict with pulled pork special, which comes served on top of one of their killer homemade biscuits. It was probably one of the best things I've ever had! Expect to wait for a bit, as they don't take reservations, but it is well worth the wait. It's easier for smaller groups to get seated, so keep that in mind.

Brenda's is easily my favorite restaurant ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH!!!!  Every time I go to SF I always make an effort to come here. The original restaurant was very small, probably the size of a small "old school" barber-shop, but it's been remodeled and they added another wing on.  They definitely needed it when their supply couldn't even meet their demand w/ a 45 min average wait. The beignets are out of this world delicious.  I'd recommend getting the crawfish beignets as they can act as a meal or a appetizer.  You can try the beignet flight and get all the various flavors, personally I think they desert beignets are just "aite."  I usually order 6 crawfish beignets, and whatever I can't finish I take home lol. The Catfish benedicts are good.  They're warm and gooey and melt in your mouth.  I usually order this. French toast is warm, fluffy, and super good.   Gumbo is pretty good too, it fills you up and can easily be a meal.  I'd recommend getting a cup of this for the first time. Expect a long wait time but definitely worth it.  I'd go really early to avoid the lines.   5 stars!!!

This place is a bit unorganized. The waitress told us that she had a table for us. But then the hostess didn't want us to sit down yet, because we didn't put our names on the chalkboard. We were very confused. The Crawfish Beignets were rated on "The Big Eat List of 2012" , I didn't think it was that great though. I think if it was bite size it would've been better. The bread is slightly too thick for the small filling. We also had gumbo, very heavenly- must get. I got the BFC (which is fried chicken). Everything was very good. The best part was not the chicken though, it was the biscuit. The collard greens were very good too. Then we had dessert, we had their special- the banana foster bread pudding. It was so yummy.

Ambiance 4/5 Food 4/5 Drinks 5/5 Service 1.5/5 To start this restaurant's decor is fabulous, the idea of writing your name on the chalk board when you enter for your seating is very cute and the different sized mirrors on one of the walls is absolutely adorable. There was no wait and we were seated right away with no reservations. The area we were seated at was rather close to the other patrons and I was bumped multiple times as I was seated in a chair on the isle as opposed to the booth side. The watermelon ice tea is extremely refreshing and delicious. Unfortunately the service was definitely lacking as we had to ask more than once for refills on our tea. We had the Beignet Flight: plain, apple, chocolate, and craw fish we also had the  sloppy Joe's remade into dirty Josephine's (at least that's what I think they were called). The plain beignets were by far the best and absolutely delicious. The chocolate beignets were good but super rich, the apple beignets were also very good I think they would have been better if they had still been warm when we got them (again I think service was an issue there). I didn't care for the craw fish beignets as it had a lot of cheyenne powder on top that you kind of inhaled, also it was pretty spicy but if you like a little kick it might just be for you. The Josephine's were very yummy with a nice flavor of cumin added. We got some of the plain beignets to go, they were thrown in a bag where they got mashed up and I hate to say weren't nearly as good just hours later. Also our waitress threw our leftovers all in the same bag (mind you that was chocolate, apple and craw fish beignets all put together not even separated by parchment or wax paper). We also had to wait a while for our to go order, and ask for the check. The waitress did not check on us once on her own or offer refills when she saw our tea was gone and knew we were waiting for a to go order. So overall the food was great. The service sucked.  Would I eat here again...yes the food was that good, but I would make sure I had more time as the service was slow and the restaurant was not that packed to warrant that crappy of service.

I went here on Monday morning on President's day after having a lot of places closed for the holiday my brother and I decided to trust yelpers reviews and try out Brenda's. My brother had gotten back from New Orleans the night before and couldn't believe how authentic everything was. I had the french toast with butter pecan sauce. OMG that was soooooo amazing! warm and crunchy and buttery with a little saltiness on top of perfectly golden fluffy french toast. Want. More. Now........ drool.... Also we split the grits that were warm and creamy with a nice cheesy finish. It was so good - definitely a must try and must go back - a lot!

The crawfish beignet is really good. Not the sweet one. Feel free to try the apple but chocolate and plain one is average. They will be better off using the nutella for the chocolate cause the chocolate chip they use is not very good.  The beignet texture isn't the best. Too dense or doughy imo. I like another restaurant by 3rd street Just for you that has a much fluffy texture.  However, I heard they may not serve beignet over there anymore... :( Fried chicken was good but not really awesome. It's juicy and the the batter is fine but not extraordinary. Oyster and shrimp poo boy is good.   Mac n cheese is very good. Haven't eaten that good of Mac n cheese for a while. The crispy cheese top is what made it awesome. Watermelon ice tea is interesting. The coq monsieur was disappointing, it looks great on picture, but the cheese wasn't grilled well, and the cheese they use aren't Gruyere cause it doesn't smell or taste that great. All in all, it's a great place to try other interesting cuisine than American cuisine.

I've been back so many times now, and I always want to go back with a friend. Today I finally got hold of the Sweet Potato Dumplings with Shrimp and Crawfish, and was pleasantly surprised. Where I'd never seen pictures of the dish and assumed a more hearty meal, it was actually a lighter fare than expected (though certainly enough of a portion to justify the price), but a cream biscuit made up for the difference and then some, and splitting a Crawdad Beignet did me in. Never disappointed yet.

Also amazing, smoky pork belly with spicy onion relish, a sunny side up egg on bed of cheesy creamy grits. Mmmhhmmm.....the wait was worth it.

The line is SO long! So definitely come early - we came about 10:00AM on Saturday, took us about 5 minutes to get seated. We ordered the crawfish beignets per suggestion - it was pretty good, but depends on your palette. The savory/sweet was delicious, although a bit spicier than I liked. I ordered the catfish benedict - 5stars! But the BF ordered the fritata...too much cheese. Definitely go with grits for the side, very authentic southern brunch. Would come here again. By the time we left ~ 11:30AM or noon...there were about two dozen people waiting...crazy popular!

When I'm feeling slightly grit-ty, a little over-easy and hungry for a meal rich and hearty enough to keep me going for hours, Brenda's is always a welcome destination in the fair city of 'Frisco. While the wait is still sure to be hefty during weekend brunch, we had the pleasure of dining on the first day following their remodel. The once cramped and cozy NOLA nook in the Loin is now wide open, double the size and bathed in sunlight. Everything on the menu is surely drool-worthy and if you haven't been yet, don't miss a chance to enjoy the flight of sweet and savory beignets. I also make sure that always order up grits with my meal since they do the best version I've ever enjoyed -- yes, even better than Mississippi. Perfectly cooked, buttery, flavorful - they're grit-tastic! The perfection and buttery goodness extends to every dish at Brenda's and I've yet to endure a bad meal. Keep in mind that everything is incredibly rich, however, so check your diet at the door. I've heard from many a foodie that New Orleans cuisine is tops, and there's no doubt that Brenda would make 'em proud.

Amazing, amazing breakfast!   The doorman at The Clift, where we were staying, referred Brenda's to us.  Those guys always know where to eat. It was well worth the 45 minute wait (Saturday morning).  The beignets are fantastic...and they'll split up the "flight" order if you just want one or two...because they're huge. Fried catfish eggs benedict?? Quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had...and my husband had the pulled pork benedict and raved all the way through the last bite. And the grits...oh the grits.  Yummm! You won't need to eat for at least a day after breakfast here, but I can't wait to be back in San Fran and go again. Wish we had one in San Diego!

Wait - 1 hour on Sunday, no surprise there. Service- Not bad Food- Holy crap, lemme break it down for you: 1. You should just get the Watermelon Ice Tea without question. What's that? I said no question! 2. Get the Hangtown Fry if you like cumin and oysters. Man the oysters were so fresh there were tiny pieces of oyster shell in it. *crunch crunch* SO GOOD. 3. Beignet Flight - Only the crawfish was worth it, skip all others. 4. Chicory Coffee - slightly different from normal coffee, def would drink again. PS: Biscuits and Grits were pretty bomb too. Hash was meh, don't get them.

I finally had the chance to come with my friends on a Saturday morning after hearing my friend rave about it for a year. There was quite a wait, and actually they called our name and we missed it, but when we inquired about it they put our name back up on their little chalkboard and seated us as soon as they could. The restaurant is pretty small and cozy, but I loved that it was so airy and bright inside! I love natural light so much more than fluorescent light, so that was a definite plus. I started off with some watermelon iced tea, which I had heard was really good. However, it tasted a little odd to me, so I probably wouldn't get it again if I had the chance. I had the hangtown fry (oyster, bacon & scallion scramble) with hash and a biscuit. The oysters were good! And the bacon, of course, made the scramble better. :) The hash was decent, but the biscuit was sooo good and buttery. The meal was definitely on the heavy side. I tried some of my friend's catfish po boy too, which was great too. The catfish was super tender and perfectly fried. My friends and I also shared the beignet flight, which came with 1 plain, 1 chocolate, 1 apple, and 1 crawfish beignet. My favorite was definitely the crawfish one! Unusual but delicious! The others were just okay, in my opinion. Another nice weekend brunch spot! Get there early to avoid a long wait! :)

As an out of towner this place was def worth getting up early and walking thru a sketchy neighbourhood to have breakfast. Got there a little after 8 on a Saturday morn and it was filling up quick. I ordered coffee, orange juice, plain beignets and cheddar/andouille sausage omelette.  Everything was awesome, service was great, nice ambience (jazz/blues/soul music playing).  Best breakfast I've had in a long time but make sure you're hungry bordering on starving when you get here cuz portions are good size and filling.  Highly recommended!

I love Brendas!  I've been going since they opened up and just went back again with my friend Megan P.  We got the beignets filled w/molten Ghirardelli chocolate to start and damn they are freaking tasty! As Megan said, nothing like an appetizer that's like dessert to start off a meal! I had the special of the day which was a pork belly and poached egg grits masterpiece (see pic).  I saw that Brenda was inside cooking that day too since we've photographed her for the Bold Italic a while back so it was cool seeing her (hopefully) making my ridiculously good grits.   Can't wait to go back and figured I was due to post an updated review.

I have to admit, the wait for our food was a bit long. We came here in the morning as well, so it wasn't packed or anything but go figure. They have the creole music playing in the background, high ceilings, plenty of space, and great staff. We ordered the beignet flight and he ate the tartine something with bacon, gruyere, and hash on the side. The beignets were not oily, they were big, had a solid good texture ( unlike a donut , those fluffy fairy foods) and all four were delicious. We had plain, the crawfish savory one, chocolate, and apple filling. I think apple filling was my favorite. Cafe au lait was.... kind of watery but it was alright. Would come here again some time.

What can I say that everyone else hasn't? I would love to come back for brunch on a weekend but I honestly refuse to wait. Thankfully, my friends and I were able to slide right in for dinner with zero wait time. Day after Thanksgiving, WOOHOO! So here's what we had.. Onion Soup Gratinée    - tasted like the run of the mill French Onion Soup. Nothing special here. crawfish beignets - although these are covered in cayenne powder, they're not spicy at all. but beware that these are HUGE HUGE HUGE. One was really filling so I barely touched mine. We all boxed ours to go because we wanted our entrees. oyster flight (one of each type of broiled oyster) Casino - Bacon, scallion, biscuit crumbs, parmesan, gruyère. tasty, not to mention HUGE. they put 2 oysters in one shell. Tchoupitoulas - Cayenne butter, garlic, herbs ooOoOhweEEEEE this was SPICY! It definitely had some Southern kick to it and I loved it. This was my favorite broiled oyster out of the trio. Orleans - Blackened Voodoo bbq sauce - delicious velvety smoked bbq sauce with just a small kick to it. maybe just a punt. shrimp & grits - ooOoO I love me some grits. How do they make them so smooooooooooooooooooth!? So smooth they're smoove. MmM MmM MmMM Catfish des Allemands - lovely. crawfish pot pie (special of the day) - HUGE. It was more like a baked dish with a giant biscuit smothered in cheddar but no complaints here! The biscuit was heavenly and it was chock full of crawfish. Excellent flavor. I'm coming back for brunch...one day. One day when I can brave the crowd and wait.

Breakfast at Brenda's is AWESOME!  Cheese grits, chocolate beneits, watermelon iced tea, and that crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside biscuit.... mmmm *drooling* Brenda's is one of the best breakfast spots I've been to.  Food was amazing and staff was very friendly.  If you get there during peak breakfast times be prepared to wait, but be patient because your patience will be rewarded.   Oh and if you think you've had good grits before, wait till you get some grits from here.  Every morning would be great if it could start with food like this.

I should have wrote this review months back when I first visited Brenda's back in March, however, I am still recovering from the meal that I had which I have to say was near heavenly! I could not get enough of just about everything we ordered and with six of us at the table it seemed like the food was endless. We could not  help ourselves and passed around our individual plates to sample the "LOVE" yes, it was all LOVE! I can't begin to say how much this place feeds not only your hunger but your soul. My only suggestion is to get there early the line started to form right as they open so to grab a spot I'd camp overnight, yes it gets that busy - especially on a Sunday morning. Otherwise, if you have time and don't mind the wait order a cup of coffee and sit outside and make new friends while your table is being set up, always fun and great to meet locals and travelers alike and Brenda's brings them both together. Love you this place!

Today was my second time at Brenda's for brunch.  The last time was a month and a half ago.  I think it is safe to say I am starting to become a regular.  You can't blame me though because Brenda's is one of the best places to be at for brunch. Line is always long - usually about an hour to an hour and a half.  I thought that since it was raining, not many people would show up.  But I guess everyone else was thinking the same thing.  BUT they just finished renovating their expansion.  So while they told us our expected waiting time would be about an hour and a half, we got in in 45 minutes.  If you are driving, I would suggest to come here on a Sunday because you'll get free street parking rather than having to run to the meter every hour or so. Their portions are very generous and a lot of the dishes are very heavy so expect to have food coma shortly after your meal (food coma is kicking my arse as I am writing this). I always order their beignets.  Last time, I tried the sampler but the crawfish beignet is still the best.  I really wanted to try their special beignet of the day - banana with honey and cream cheese - but they ran out.  :(  But it's fine because 3 crawfish beignets (that's one order of crawfish beignet) are more than enough for 2 girls. I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly special which was crispy pork belly on top of cheddar grits accompanied by a poached egg and onion relish.  It was the bomb (do people still say that?).  I'm very particular about my pork belly but it was perfect.  Not too fatty and super crispy!  The cheddar grits are as delicious and the same as the grits in the Shrimp n Grits dish, which I recommended to my friend.  That is one of the best dishes they have, especially if you're a grits fan.  It's flavorful, cheesy, and hot - perfect for a cold rainy day. Of course, you have to get the Sweet Watermelon House Tea.  You get unlimited refills and it's refreshing.   Overall:  Long wait but generous hearty and flavorful dishes.  Definitely recommend.

Their Watermelon Iced Tea was so refreshing and crisp!  My favorite thing here!  I came here for breakfast on a Wednesday morning so there was no wait.  The service was decent.   We had the Beignet Flight and the Grillades & Grits.  The flight consisted of four beignets (plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, and crawfish).  The beignets here are heavy and doughy.  My favorite was the chocolate! Gooey, melty deliciousness in the center of a fried ball of dough.  Yum.  The crawfish beignet was very tasty and flavorful but slightly fishy.  The apple one tasted like an apple pie.  The plain left much to be desired, but add a bit of the strawberry compote and you've got something.   The Grillades & Grits is described as beef cutlets braised in a spicy creole gravy, served with grits & two eggs any style.  The sauce was flavorful with many spices.  It was definitely needed to accompany the plain grits. This was a decent breakfast for $30.  Very heavy though.  I would return but I think for lunch or dinner instead!

If I could give Brenda's 6 stars, I would!  Food is amazing.  (Just don't think about the butter and fat that's in it.)  Service was ok and fast.   Only caution is the LONG, LONG wait.  So strategize and try to go when everyone else isn't doing brunch/lunch.  If you must, have a little bit of something to prepare for the long wait.  Also, bring quarters for the parking meters.  Parking can be tough.

I really dislike to wait for my food, but I must say that this time it is worth it. I had the tartine and it was really great. Forgot what my husband had, but he was quite happy too. The space is cute, and the menu is super creative. I am removing a star for the service. Our waitress didn't even asked us how things were going when she did for the table NEXT to us and behind us. I wanted some sour creme on the side, but it's as if she purposefully avoided to look at me every time I tried to get her attention... We were not given a chance to order other drinks, as the check was shoved on our face and our plates removed the minute there was no food left on the table, and new utensiles  placed in front of us. Not such a good feeling. I don't care how good your food is, if your staff sucks, it doesn't matter much to me.

They do a Crawlfish Beignets that, for lack of a better word, you will burn in hell for eating.... Not because of the spiciness mind you.  It's just a damn fine piece of cooking. The beignet itself, is very light and airy.  You don't conceive that this thing was deep fried at all.  Then there is the crawlfish stuffing --- how in God's name they got that in there without it leaking or making the thing mushy?  Then the massive dusting of cayenee pepper.   Then there is the fried chicken.... Let's just say that fried chicken makes you feel guilty for ever touching KFC, Roy Rogers, Popeye's, and various other travesties.... 'nuff said, now go get some!

You got out of town guests for brunch? Brenda's! The hot chick you met last night actually gave you her real number? Brenda's!   When they first opened it only had few tables and so you had to write your name in small letters on a crowded chalkboard. But thankfully last year they knocked out a wall and doubled in size. There is still a wait and  still a chalkboard, but order a coffee or an OJ and you'll be seated in no time. Its French, its Soul, its Cajun, its Creole and comforting for all. I've been here 5 times in last 4 months, and never disappoints. Which means i've had several out of town guests and ok, maybe one hot chick. I've had po-boys sandwiches to go, which are great, but this place is for brunch, ie  still early for lunch, but not too early to drink.  Thus, Bloody Mary's are very good!  However their signature  watermelon Iced tea (non-alcoholic) is awesome and a must-try. You're just getting up and hungry or hungover, so let me get to nitty gritty: MUST-TRY: Beignets, Shrimp & Grits (beware, its heavy), biscuits&gravy, Andouille MAYBE NOT: pancakes (dont waste the space)

SO SO TASTY!! Me and my boyfriend came here for Valentine's day and it rocked. So first we started with a cup of gumbo. SO GOOOD. Me and my boyfriend are avid gumbo eaters and willing to try a cup if offered. I had the crawfish/andouille sausage pot pie I believe it was called. It was one of the specials of the day. I loved it! Warning: there is A LOT of cheese. It came with a delicious side salad with a simple vinaigrette on top. My boyfriend got the chicken. He said it could be better. The biscuits that came with his were really good! For dessert, we took some apple filled beignets home. They were delicious! Definitely going to come back and try other things! The watermelon iced tea wasn't as great as everyone on yelp said it was. It was cool and refreshing, but not amazing. Service was average. Overall, satisfied and wanting more!

My table and I had a meeting at 12 back in the East Bay, so we came here fairly early (around 8:30am) to make sure we could make it back on time.  The traffic and parking was a breeze on this lazy Sunday morning.  To top that off, the wait didn't take that long (around 5-10 minutes) after we wrote our party's name down on the chalk board.  It seemed that there were always a few people lingering around the entrance of the doorway and waiting area throughout our entire stay there. Even though it has been a couple months, the taste of the beignets tastefully linger in my memory.  We had the beignet sampler, which consisted of plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish.  My favorites were the plain and apple.  I thought it was also worth noting, though, that they use Ghirardelli chocolate for their chocolate beignet.  Yumm... All in all, it was a great experience.  I would go back to try something different.  Maybe next time, the eggs benedict...

Damnit, 1.5 hour wait for an establishment is ridiculous, and I only do it to places that are to die for. My thought is that you can't really go wrong with breakfast food but why hype it up? The only other place I've heard that is ridiculous is Mama's and I still haven't been. Luckily, I had a book on hand and a seat inside to wait so I was good. The decor and ambiance is perfect for a sunny day. By the time we finally sat down I was so hungry. I don't with the shrimp and grits even though I'm not really much of a grits person. You need to live and die by grits to love this dish because it is covered in grits. Very hearty. The shrimp and tomatoes were good, but not enough variety. The watermelon juice was tasty but sweet - also need to love watermelon to love this. I almost wish I would have just stuck to what I love - eggs, bacon, the usual. They don't specialize in anything amazing, at least not what I have experienced so far. I'd rather stick to my local Joe's Diner for a meal less than 5 bucks. Maybe, just maybe I'll try something else, but only if I don't have to do the waiting!

I promised that I would come back to Brenda's for breakfast after a disappointing experience a few years ago. I thought the food was uninspired, the space very cramped, and just an overall letdown from the rave reviews I had been hearing. The Brenda's of a few years ago has now been replaced with a much more inspired menu and an ample seating area that has a sleek and homey feel. Monelle P. and I decided to forgo the beignets (which are awesome) and go straight for the entrees. I settled on the fried chicken eggs benedict while she had the pork belly grits. The fried chicken eggs benedict was good, but suffered from some miscues. First, the accompanying potato hash was served cold. Second, the poached egg was not as runny as I would have wanted. While the not-runny poached egg was a forgivable offense, the cold potato has was not. It's essentially the one thing you can do to mess up a potato hash. I was tempted to send it back, but it was too early to be "one of those guys." Instead, I debated in my head whether this had been left over from yesterday's breakfast service, or if it has been prepared in advance. I settled on the latter to make myself feel better. At least the biscuit, hollandaise sauce and fried chicken were tasty. But what really saved this meal was the pork belly grits. The pork belly was perfectly moist and crispy at the same time. The grits had a wonderful richness that went well with the pork belly. Plus, being able to wash down the meal with unlimited watermelon ice tea refills helped turn this potential 3-star rating to a 4-star rating. While "friendly" isn't a word I would use to describe the wait staff's demeanor, it was certainly efficient which is a-ok in my book. The food came out quickly, and I never had to ask for a refill for coffee or ice tea. I could tell the wait staff have grown accustomed to trying to turn over a large number of tables as quickly as possible. I don't blame them - the line outside of Brenda's starting at 9:30am until 1:00pm is long.

While on the prowl for a delicious brunch spot on Sunday morning, my boyfriend and I decided to head to Brenda's to give it a whirl (2500+ reviews & 4 stars is definitely an enticing prospect). After putting our names on the chalkboard, we waited for about an hour and a half to be seated. Normally, I wouldn't wait that long for brunch, but you hit a point of no return where you just CAN'T bring yourself to leave (usually after about 45 minutes of waiting). Once we were seated, we immediately gravitated toward the crawfish beignets. Delish and HUGE. I was expecting them to be about half the size, but these things were enormous! For my meal, I ended up going with the shrimp & grits and my boyfriend opted for the catfish eggs benedict. My food was good, though not overwhelmingly so and his left me wishing I would have ordered the eggs benedict, too. Favorite parts of the whole meal: beignets & watermelon iced tea. I would go back to try out their dinner menu, which looks fantastic, but I wouldn't wait an hour and a half for their brunch. It's worth a 30 minute wait tops (possibly a weekday brunch spot if you can swing it). I'm sure I'll be back for a second review when I pop in for dinner. Only hoping that their dinner leaves me a little more impressed.

Two friends and I came for a late Monday brunch (~2:30pm) and found ourselves waiting until about 3:20 for a seat. The official lunch time ends at 3, but as long as you get on the waiting list by around 2:40 you're good to go! Atmosphere: exposed walls with modern columns set up in the middle. Hip and trendy with some old school flair in the little buckets of condiments on each table. On one wall, an awesome collection of mismatched mirrors. I had the assorted plate of beignets ($9.50) because I wanted to taste as much as possible in one dish. *While i wasn't particularly keen on the chocolate or plain beignet, the apple beignet was pretty tasty (the better apple pie, perhaps) and the crawfish beignet. My god, has anything I've ever eaten been that flavorful?! A MUST. I had a taste of my friend's Croque Monsieur (I'd say it's basically ham and cheese) but it was just as tasty. Seasoning is everything here, it seems. My other friend's pot-pie ish dish was AMAZING. I wish I remembered the name of it, but by god. Brenda, we have to run off and be wed because I need your cooking every day of my life. My waistband won't mind.

Came here for Saturday brunch with a line out the door. Write your name on their chalkboard to get seats! We got the + Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions & cheddar beignets. It was 3 for $8. My friend loved these but I'm going to try one of their sweeter ones next time to compare to New Orleans. + Shrimp and grits for $12. SO WORTH IT! I loved how the cheddar cheese melted over and stretched out as I put it into my mouth. There was a good amount of the sautéed shrimp.. Finally, the spicy tomato-bacon gravy wasn't too overpowering but a perfect complement to the entire dish. + The French toast ($7.50) with butter pecan sauce (an extra $1). When it came out, I was surprised to see 6-8 generous pieces! It was soaked to perfection in the pecan sauce. I think my heart just skipped a beat thinking about this.

Came here with my boyfriend and two other friends, waited for 3 hours!!! Giving 1 star for their customer service, pretty friendly and nice enough to offer free drinks while waiting; some people asked for a bottle of beer and some asked for a glass of wine. Giving another 1 star for their Crawfish Beignet, my boyfriend found it fishy but I found it fantastic! Maybe I just love anything crawfish. HAHA! Other foods weren't all that great, just some regular breakfast that we can normally get from a Danny's restaurant. Parking is difficult too; we had to feed our meter every other hour and it's hard to ask for coins too. Would I come back? Well, maybe ordering an order of Crawfish Beignet to-go. Not worth the wait at all!

The crawfish beignets were yummy! However, I had to scrap off some of the stuff on top since it was too salty. But inside the crawfish was so warm and tasty that i couldnt get enough of it! I was so full from the tea and crawfish that I couldn't finish my egg benedict and had to bring most of it home. But the egg was just right. I love the interior decorations, and I like how you can sit and view the whole restaurant. OH beware, this place is crowded. There is a board where we put our name on Page 4.... so we walked over to Philz cafe to grab coffee for an hr on Saturday lunch time and came back right on time for our name. So be prepared to wait an hour to hour and a half to be seated. The service is marvelous and I can see why everyone would want to come back

Strolling by 12:30pm on a Saturday, you are guaranteed to be waiting at least 30 minutes... But! It is completely worth the wait! The brunch is fantastic! Tried their beignet flight, which consisted of their traditional (no filling), green apple (my favorite, if going for a sweet beignet), chocolate, and crawfish (savory delight!). I did not expect them to be so big, as the beignets I've tried at Hops & Hominy were more bite-sized. The beignets at Brenda's are almost equivalent to your typical donut, serving-wise. But... It's all good! If you can't finish them all, you can easily take it home with you for tomorrow's breakfast or midnight snack... :) The gumbo was delicious. Nice consistency and very flavorful. Each bite packed with a nice kick from all the spices. A bowl of gumbo and beignets is more than enough food for brunch... But of course... I had to try some of my boyfriend's crispy pork belly with cheddar grits and poached egg! He said it was the best breakfast food he has ever had! The egg was perfectly runny and the combination of it all was great. Can't wait to come back here another time, but perhaps for dinner instead. I was a bit bummed that their fried chicken was not a part of their brunch menu... Oh well!

This place combines two of my favorite cuisines: French and Soul. Ahh! Got here around 1:30PM on a Saturday, and there was a decent line in front of us already, but suprisingly we didn't have to wait that long to get seated. Some kind of magic keeps their tables turning over fast - maybe how each table is only 2 people large and they can keep rearranging them to suit the size of each party. Got the watermelon tea, the crawfish beignets, and the catfish eggs benedict. The waitress kind of gave me a look for ordering so much food, but in my defense, all of the beignets I've seen up to this point are small. This beignet was HUGE!! Like..bigger than my iphone. It was so yummy though, with crawfish and cheese(?) inside. I can definitely see why it made it on the 7x7 list. The eggs benedict were also good, but average compared to the ones i've had everywhere else. I had to take a bunch of my food home, and it wasn't until the next day when I went to reheat my beignet that I realized how much oil was in the thing - it had completely soaked through the to-go bag! Kind of gross. But it was still delicious! Some kind of magic for sure.

I don't see what all the hype is about for this place. The food was just satisfactory. And my story begins... My friends and I went to Brenda's for Sunday brunch. After waiting for possibly 10 mins, we were seated. (I heard the wait can go up to an hour) So, I wasn't at all complaining about the wait time. I ordered a Watermelon Ice Tea. I must say, that the tea was divine. My friends and I ordered appetizers. I ordered the Craw-fish Beignets. It was just OK. Nothing special. For my entree, I got the shrimp and grits. Real disappointed. It was so gross. I couldn't even finish it all. My friend ordered french toast and I ended up eating off her plate because I be dam if I eat another bite of that shrimp and grits! Yuck! All and All, the service was good and so was the Watermelon Ice Tea. But, I'll pass if someone ask me to go with them to Brenda's.

4.5 stars rounded up to 5!  amazing goodness! We've been waiting oh so long to finally try the ever so popular brenda's french soul food...since wifey and i had the day off yesterday, our first thought was to wake up super early and get here at 8am when they opened.   we arrived around 8:15 and half of their tables were already filled...on a monday!  during our experience, quite a few people came in picking up togo orders.  must be good stuff right?  RIGHT! so we started off with the crawfish beignet...honetly, i wasn't impressed.  when i think of a beignet, i think of soft fluffy clouds.  these beignets were on the chewier, tough, super deep fried side...although the stuffing was delicious.  i didn't let the beignets hold us down though... i ordered one of the specials from the board:  crispy pork belly, cheddar grits, poached egg, and spicy onion relish.  AMAZINGNESS!!!  everything about it was perfect...the grits were sooooooo tasty...who in their right minds would ever say that the grits here was one of the most amazing things i have ever tasted?  come on...they're just little corn things mixed with butter and stuff in a bowl...um, ME!  super goodness...the pork belly was crisp and melted in my mouth...the poached egg and relish brought everything together.  YUM! wifey had the pumpkin pancakes with gingersnap pecan steusel and vanilla cream cheese.  i don't normally eat any form of nuts (lol)...but i had to try these pancakes.  WHOA.  best pancakes i have ever consumed!!!  the pecans were plentiful and the pancake was fluffy...and the cream cheese was delish.  YUM YUM YUM!!! the service was a little dry...but i really didn't care cause the food spoke for itself.  we got our coffee and water refilled before it hit the bottom of the glass...and our leftovers were packed by the servers...so i can overlook the friendliness.   best breakfast thus far...can't wait to go again this weekend!!!

My cousin, Vanessa D., was adamant about eating at Brenda's French Soul Food upon our arrival in San Francisco and I now know why.  Brenda serves up some DELICIOUS food.  This was one of the best places we ever ate at during our trip.   We ordered the beignet flight (plain, apple, chocolate, & crawfish) and the grillades & grits (Beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy, served with grits & two eggs any style, plus cream biscuit).  The beignets were so good.  I preferred the sweet ones to the savory one and my favorite was the apple.  The chocolate beignet was made with Ghirardelli chocolate making it rich and decadent.  The grillades & grits were amazing.  The creole gravy had a spicy kick to it and the biscuit was super flaky and melt-in-your-mouth good.  It was the BEST biscuit I've ever had!  The biscuits are like biting into fluffy clouds of joy.  We also tried the sweet watermelon house tea which was so refreshing; it had bits of cucumber and melon in it too.   We were there on a Friday morning and the place was packed.  Brenda's is a small restaurant but they are expanding so even though there was construction happening next door, the restaurant was still full to capacity which is a testament to the food and its popularity.

This place is the bombdiggy!! The best little breakfast spot in SF. Be prepared to wait for over an hour for a table...and don't you dare try to show up with a group of 6 at 11 am on a Sunday. You won't get in. Some of my faves: -Beignets Sampler -Gumbo -Shrimp & Grits -Fried Chicken (sooo good!) -Fried Oyster (or shrimp) Po Boy (my absolute fave) The home made pickles rock and the watermelon iced tea is really good! Service is usually decent.  Just be prepared to wait and wait some more if you go anytime between 9-1:30. I love Brenda's and it's one of my favorite food spots in SF. And YES...it's worth every second of the wait!  Enjoy!

Brenda's was our second choice as Red Door Cafe's wait time was 2.5 hours. We came on a Sunday so street parking was thankfully free! We weren't sure if we were at the right place as the signage isn't too great, but you are at the right place if you see a little huddle of people waiting outside. How it works: You go inside and write your name on the chalk board with the # of people in your party. There are 4 columns of names. From the first to the 3rd column (where we were) we were told that the wait time would be about an hour since it was a cold SF mid morning and people were dropping out. We did indeed wait about an hour and as we were walked in, we told the front of house that we were ready to order! And before actually getting situated, there she was. Our waitress. "I heard you guys are ready?" Party of 4. When more than one of us asked a question on an opinion, should I get Option A or Option B? Our waitress wasn't too thrilled - "I thought you guys were ready. Do you guys need another minute?" Daaaang. But it was alright. Our food came out speedy fast! and thank goodness, because we were famished. We all ordered something on their special menu - I would recommend ordering their frittatas! (The day we went their special was a seafood frittata! YUM. except we found a hair in it :T) They were nice about it and replaced for another dish since the seafood frittata was sold out. (on the house) They are known for their grits but for me. I wished my dish wasn't JUST grits (with poached egg, pork belly, spicy onion relish). Try to get a dish that comes with their famous biscuits (it's their main picture on their website) and maybe try grits on the side. Watermelon Iced Tea though!! YUM! :) Pricewise - Expect to pay about $15 - 20 per person.

I've never had "soul food" before, but Brenda's sure filled my soul...and stomach! I came here at the peak of lunch time today with a friend and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. I ordered the Beignet Flight, a sampling of all four beignets offered. Considering how three of the four beignets were sweet, I tried to find the perfect order to eat them. The four were consumed as such: plain, chocolate, crawfish, finished with the apple cinnamon. I loved each beignet dearly, all except the chocolate one. Though I have a crazy sweet tooth, there just seemed to be too much chocolate in that beignet (too much gooey, chocolatey sweetness). I fell in love with the apple cinnamon beignet, I mean, it's literally an apple pie in the form of a hot pocket! That beignet alone is the perfect meal ender. I'll definitely dine at Brenda's again, but considering her large portions, I'll consider sharing a dish rather than consuming one alone. My tummy can't handle the entirety of Brenda's soul food goodness.

Brenda's is great for brunch or breakfast. Get the beignet flight as it comes with 1 apple, 1 plain, 1 chocolate, and one crawfish. Also, the grits are amazing! The portions are sizable especially if you get the beignet flight so order accordingly or think about sharing. As for the wait, it's manageable if you get there within an hour of their opening time ... ie 9 am, otherwise, it can be pretty long wait.

I had nothing but amazing expectations of this place and Brenda's did NOT fail to impress me for my lunch experience today! Came around 12:45p to reserve a table for a girlfriend and I who were going to have lunch. The service was going by really fast. I had three parties ahead of me and was ready to be seated about 10 minutes after placing my name on the wait list. For lunch in the area, this is a HUGE plus for me, as we all know trying to get a great bite in minimal time can be an experience in itself. Sat down and ordered the Watermelon Iced Tea. It wasn't amazing as I thought it would be, but it was decent enough. It was slightly bland, but tasteful enough for me to not have to add sugar into it. Initially, I wanted to try the Red Beans and Rice dish (this was my first time here and I looked on the menu online beforehand), but once I actually got in, the specials menu revealed a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich special... You know how I feel about the pork. *ear-to-ear grin* The food came out fairly quickly...about ten minutes or so...and upon arrival I danced up and down for joy...in my head. This thing was truly a work of art. Beautifully cooked pulled pork upon a lightly toasted french roll and open-faced so I could just sit there and look at it in awe. The sandwich was AMAZING. The meat was tender and seasoned with love all around it. The sauce was complex. It hit the palette as sweet, but left a nice spice kick after the bite ended. It was great. I'm a believer, and I put it up there with The Trappist in Oakland as having one of the best pulled pork sandwiches ever,..and for the portions, the $10 price tag is UNDER what it should be. This could easily be a $15 sandwich and I would still make it rain for a taste,

I live a 1/2 block away from this place and always notice the long line forming in front of the restaurant. Then I went to see the reviews on Yelp and said I've got to get some of this food people are raving. I'm fortunate enough to live nearby so I skipped that whole waiting in line and simply ordered over the phone and have my husband picked up the food that was ready in less than 15 minutes, which was great. We ordered the Beignet Flight because we wanted to taste every one of those beignets that people gave so many stars for. My husband ordered the Grillades and Grits (with egg whites) that came with cream biscuit. The size of the beignets is truly decent! I could only have 2 bites of each for me to be able to taste every one of them and a few spoonful of the Grillades and Grits with a bite of that gigantic Cream Biscuit and... Seriously, all of them are SLAP-YO-MAMA-KINDA-GOOD!!! One of the best brunches I ever had. Well done, Brenda... Well done...

Talk about DELISH!!!! Had Saturday brunch here. Arrived about 1030am and there was not too much of a wait. Maybe 15 mins. It's super cute. We walk in and sign our names on a huge chalk board waiting list. Even though it was busy, staff was on cue and offered us beverages while we wait. *Watermelon iced tea is really refreshing. Reminds me of Sweet Tea from the South! *Sweet Potato Pancakes with a buttery pecan sauce. This was sooooo good. Very sweet but worth it. * Original Beignets. Fried  just right and great texture *Hangtown Fry. Oysters in here!!! Savory! Came w/ grits. I haven't had grits in years. And it was buttery, cheesy, and creamy This place is worth the wait and the trip out there. Food amazing, Staff awesome, Decor impeccable.

crawfish beignets are the one menu item i would come back everyday for. I dont even remember what other things i ate. i came here for late lunch with my best friend, and they were still serving brunch menu items. not many people in the restaurant at that time, so I think late lunchtime would be an ideal place to go to talk and enjoy yummmmmy food!

Brenda's needs to be investigated because there must be crack in those biscuits.  I'm willing to do lots of things outside my comfort zone like wait two hours to taste the pinnacle of fluffy, hot buttery goodness that is one of those biscuits.  I've ordered the half a dozen frozen so I can have a biscuit whenever I want.   The crawfish beignets are covered in sweet smoky paprika and filled with chunks of delicious crawfish.  I get those every time.   The best brunch dish I've ever had is the catfish benedict with grits. I lay awake at night thinking about this.  Each component is amazing on its own but when combined, it gives me a well, you know.  I don't normally love benedicts because of the gooey nature of hollandaise.  Hollandaise needs to be made ala minute in order to taste fresh, light and slightly lemony.  Usually brunch places make a big batch and let it sit over a heater.  Ugh.  Brenda's version has creole spices that set it apart.   When that is not available, I get the shrimp and grits.  The shrimp is nicely cooked and the grits are creamy and delicious.  My father, whose mortal enemy is polenta, even marveled at how delicious the grits tasted.   However, some of the sweets were a bit of a let down.  The french toast and pancakes, while good, did not live up to the standard of the savory dishes.  The restaurant is also ridiculously crowded.  Thankfully, that will change when Brenda's completes the adjacent space.

Everything we ordered was great. We had the Crawfish Beignets, Mac & Cheese, BFC, Grillades & Grits, Croque Monsieur, their gumbo, and Watermelon Tea. The beignets were great, fluffy goodness. The Mac & Cheese was so creamy and delicious! The fried chickens in BFC were good, but not really great, however, I loved their biscuit. The Grillades & Grits has nice flavors with the only downside being the beef being a tad dry. The Croque Monsieur was enjoyable, but not something I would personally order (it's a sandwich). The gumbo is very flavorful and is definitely one of the better ones I have tasted. Lastly, the Watermelon Tea, it is a very interesting idea and it tasted refreshing. I rated down 1 star because the service, I did not fully enjoy their lack of service at times. They are also not always there when you need assistance. But overall, I would definitely come here again.

I wanted to try this place after seeing it on 'unique sweets: brunch' and hearing about it from a friend. I am SO glad I did! I heard about the watermelon iced tea from other reviews on yelp and being a HUGE fan of watermelon I HAD to get it. I was impressed! It was so refreshing and didn't have that fake watermelon flavor. My boyfriend and I shared the beignet flight and the shrimp po boy. Both were amazing! My favorite of the beignets was the apple one, although it did seem to be slightly under cooked and doughy in the middle it was still delish! The po boy came with watermelon pickles which were weirdly incredible, I just wish they gave you more! I will definitely go back to Brenda's!

FREE refills on their famous watermelon ice tea!  Oh- so- good!  So refreshing!! Anyway, came on a Tuesday around 11a... no wait.  I think we were lucky since 5 minutes after we sat down the crowd started coming.  Had to order the flight of beignets since it seemed like the right thing to do for first timers.  Did not regret!! My fav out of the 4 was definitely the crawfish beignet!  Also ordered the special, sweet potato pancakes with a pecan syrup.  That was pretty good.  The pancakes were light and fluffy while the pecans made that nice sweet flavor of goodness!   My 2 cousins ordered the egg and bacon tartine and the hangtown (oyster and bacon omelet).  They absolutely loved their dish... left the plate clean, even after having the flight of beignets, bloody mary & mimosas.  I say that because their portions are pretty big!  We left there feeling extremely full and about to pop, but it was worth it!

As stated on all the other yelpers, there was a wait on Saturday morning when I went for brunch.  We arrived around 10am and there was already a long line of people outside waiting. All the food there was very delicious.  I highly recommend the crawfish beignets.  We ordered the flight of Beignets and the only ones I enjoyed was the chocolate and crawfish.  Service was good considering how busy it was.  There were a few servers that cked in with us on our meal.

I was so psyched for this place, but super disappointed and here's why: STAFF CONS - Staff was NOT friendly, welcoming or overly into servicing me - When I found hair in my food, the waitress wasn't apologetic at all -  Didn't check at anytime to see how my food was FOOD CONS - I originally ordered shrimp and grits and it had TOO much cheese (apparently this dish over at 1300 Filmore is SUPERB, so I can't wait to taste that instead) - Hair in my food PROS - I met some incredibly great ppl that I am going out with Sat night!

French Soul Food! Sign Me Up! Located in a rather shady spot in the Civic/Tenderloin district, you've got an interesting adventure to get here. As for signing you up? Go inside, put your name on the chalkboard list, and wait it out. Trust me. There is some good eating here. Arrived on a Sunday morning and waited somewhere in the vicinity of 30-40minutes with the morning crowd. The staff is great, the coffee is hot, the service is efficient. The restaurant is small and packs in the people. When I found room to wait inside, I got to watch all the food come out: Eggs Benedict several different ways, a special french toast of the weekend, shrimp and grits. The smells were SO GOOD. I can't help but be sad that there is no restaurant like this in Pasadena, but that just makes the allure of San Francisco that much greater. I helped chow down on a flight of beignets, looked gluttonously envious of the food at other tables, ate my fabulous eggs benedict and left this restaurant fully satisfied and ready to press on with my day. Watermelon lemonade is great, though I sort of wish the pulp was strained out. Dining companion loved her cups of coffee and her french toast. That chocolate beignet is a brutal mistress of Ghirardelli chocolate absolutely packed inside. Shrimp & Grits will have to be my next order the next time I'm here.

Second to last food stop before going back to OC.  Thanks to Melissa, who I met at  Cantina recommended this place for a breakfast spot and I instantly yelped it and I was sold! I had Jills chili and biscuits on my mind but it got bumped off looking at Brendas menu lol.  So came in on a slightly rainy sunday and waited about 45 minutes and it was a pretty long 45 minutes. Dotties didn't seem as bad as this place. So finally our name gets called and man oh man this place is freakin small. Probably the most smallest place I ever dined in, in my life. The seating against the wall was so uncomfortable, shit all the seating is. The seats against the wall are like bench seating and the table sits so low I feel like im eating at a kiddie table and if your really overweight you will not be comfy. The chair side seems like you'll be feeling people brush against you all the time.  The waitstaff are nice and on point as well. Service in San fran has been very kind to us (not the cabs though LOL)  I started with the watermelon sweet tea. I enjoyed that, reading through the reviews it seems like some people dislike it or love it. No complaints from me, just add some ice and I'll be a happy camper. I hate places that don't give you iced water. The water becomes room temp fast, especially in this tuna can.    The whole menu sounds awesome and I wish I could of had their dinner menu. NOTE: NO FRIED CHICKEN DURING BRUNCH :(   Started with the gumbo and crawfish beignets they come in three's and they are huge. Now the filling is awesome and great spice and fresh crawfish, the dough itself is a bit much. It's tooooo doughy and doesn't seem like a true beignet. Nice try but this fails , sorry. The gumbo was good but was missing something.     Now for our main events I had the shrimp cheddar cheese grits and he had the bacon egg tartine. Man these grits were the best grits I ever had!  The cheese the tomato the BACON! So good I savored every bite and was so happy that I was able to get my leftovers through the airport security LOL. Seriously we guarded that dish as if it was a rare piece of jewelry  haha.  I didn't try his tartine but looked great and bit doughy LOL.   I would definitely give this place a shot again, But for din din so I can try the fried chicken!!! Oh and please expand your building, you totally can outbid your neighbors!

This place has slap-yo-mama good food that is worth the wait!  The crawfish beginets are delish (I prefer savory over sweet) and the others are also awesome.  It's basically a hush puppy filled with cheese, chives, and seasoned crawfish with a cayenne pepper sprinkle on top, or stuffed with chocolate, apple cinnamon, or whatever they have on the menu and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  THEY ARE BANANAS!!!  I've also had the Oyster Scramble (awesome) and the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omlet which makes my mouth water even typing it.  They do melt-in-your-mouth buttermilk biscuts with apple butter and Watermelon Iced Tea!  What would make this even better?  MIMOSA's of course (my answer to everything)!   On another note, their grits are just okay...

Some SOMA pals and I were scheduled for lunch in Little Saigon.  It was a rainy day but we opted to walk over since SF is such an amazing walking city!  When we got to our destination, we had a change of heart and spotted Brenda's French Soul Food, and the line out of the door.  Curiosity piqued, we decided to investigate.  The menu looked great and the crowd convinced us, and after a short wait, were finally seated. There were so many dishes I wanted to try, but I settled on their famous fried chicken.  Served with fries and their famous biscuit, the fried chicken was pretty awesome.  The skin was crispy, even with the sauce, and the meat was tender and juicy.  My only gripe would be that the pieces were both tiny, almost bite-sized, especially when compared to the huge biscuit.  The biscuit itself was amazing and I could eat those all day!  At about $13, it's not the cheapest fried chicken you'll ever have, but certainly one of the better versions. Service was great here, even as the restaurant was absolutely packed with the lunch crowd.  Prices are certainly higher than area lunch joints but when you're enjoying quality like they serve here, you can't complain.  I'm excited to come back to try the rest of their famous dishes! Food: 8/10 Service: 9/10 Price: $$ Atmosphere: 9/10

FABULOUS!! Was visiting my best friend in the city and she took me here, luckily there were tables open when we went (I've heard the line is sometimes long) so only had to wait for them to set it. We ordered way too much food and it was ALL DELICIOUS, especially the sweet potato dumpling entree with shrimp and crawfish. What a sauce! With a bottle of white wine we shared the gumbo, pork rilettes with pickled watermelon rind, crawfish beignet, the sweet potato dumplings, and a sweet beignet plate and bread pudding with coffee for dessert. Amazing!! Can't wait to go back!!!

Cool vibe...a little crowded and OH SO delicious.  Our table report:  the BEST biscuits we have ever eaten, fabulous beniets, terrific buttery grits and delicious entrees all around.  Met some super folks waiting for the table.  Rusty and linda were  a great ice- breaker for this terrific restaurant. My advice....come before 9am on weekends. And be sure not to miss the crawfish stuffed beniets...dusted with cayenne .  Our only issue was that our waitress did not inform us why there was a delay for iur food for up to 35 mins.  If she had told what happened....the order was cancelled out by an addition of two extra orders to our table....we would have been cool.   Still a great treat listening to NOLA zydeco and blues while waiting.  Nice host brought me a coffee while i waited for friends.  Charming spot.

I have heard so much hype about this place I just had to stop by during my weekend in San Francisco. They weren't joking that this place gets packed and there is always a line.  We stumbled in around 10 and had to wait a good 45 minutes which wasn't too bad.  It just sucked that it was freezing outside. When we finally sat down, everything on the menu looked super good.  Cool ambiance esp the wall of mirrors. We opted for the beignet flight but my favorite would have to be the crawfish beignets and apple.  Super yummy! Try it!!!!!!! My man friend ordered the seafood frittata and I got the shrimp n grits.  There was a lot of cajun spice which I liked alot but this dish will make you super full!

Stopped here for lunch right before getting hitched at city hall (true story!). I had heard such wonderful things about Brendas that it seem to befit our celebration. My parents, soon-to-be-spouse, and I ordered several items to swap around. Biscuits: Let's not beat around the bush: these cream biscuits are the best I've ever tasted. Their fluffy butterfat goodness is only improved by the amazing (house made?) vanilla bean peach preserves set out among the condiments. Fried chicken: exceedingly moist and generously portioned, although not the crispy breaded version I was expecting. I'd say this was tasty but does not compete with Bakesale Betty's for my favorite fried chicken. Gumbo: we all agreed this was a winner! Full of flavor, rich and smokey, this okra and andouille wonder wowed us more than anything we tasted in New Orleans. Grits: creamy and smooth, this reminded me more of polenta than true "gritty" grits, which is why I think I loved it so. Be aware - the portions are big. Plan to share, take back leftovers, and/or loosen your belt to accommodate Brenda's generosity. Wish that we had room to try the beignets - perhaps we will have to hit this place up for brunch on our first anniversary?

Finally came back and had the beignet flight....I always get shrimp and grits or shrimp omelette with egg whites. I'm pretty much into the health of food as much as the taste so I don't usually splurge with things like beignets. OMG, until now! The crawfish and chocolate beignets are so worth the sugar (which I generally avoid) and gave me some sort of euphoric food high. I really want to try the vanilla stout they have but I was with a nondrinker and unsure about drinking a 22oz beer while I was still in my workout clothes at 11am. Next time definitely. Can't wait to try the beignets again! They have expanded, which is awesome, but there was still a 30 minute wait at 11am. In the past we always came at 8ish in the morning and there wasn't as much of a wait....but they are thoughtful and pour you a cup while you wait so its not too bad...and definitely worth it!

So, we went a little nuts and had little dishes of almost everything.  The red beans and rice with andouille sausage was fantastic.  I'd not had better in NOLA.  The Gumbo was good, and if I had not had the RB&R I probably would have said it was great.  The ettouffee was very good even though the bright orange color seemed incongruous with the taste.  Lots of good, tender chicken in that dish.  The crab beignets were also very good as was the salad with mustard dressing; very refreshing and palate cleansing in between bites of the others.  Then there was the chicken thigh.  I love the thighs and this one was great; juicy, nicely breaded with some type of pre-soak in something spicy for the right amount of kick.  All of that (my companion and I are still full 6 hours later) along with a glass of wine and a truly great bloody mary for a few cents under $50. A $5 red beans and rice cup would be a perfectly filling and delicious lunch. Highly recommended.  They didn't put a single foot wrong on this, our first, visit.

I love how southern cooking is blended into modern contemporary! We came here as early as we could since I was told that a line forms pretty quick.  When we finally arrived we noticed that another section is under construction.  I guess it was expanding at that time which from others reviews its now open. Very simple menu.  We tried the beignets sampler which came with four.  Haven't had too many in the past so don't really know how to gauge them.  They were pretty tasty... especially the chocolate one and the crawfish beignets. I ended up trying the Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict.  How often do you get to see something like that.  Haha.  It was definitely something different.  The fish was fried to perfection and it was very fresh.  On top of that, the biscuit that they used was incredibly delicious.  It was an oversized soft biscuit.  So what I ended doing was ordering a side of biscuit and gravy and boy did I not go wrong.  They served their meat gravy which was so hearty and savory and when you dip the biscuit just soaked up all the sauce. Definitely worth mentioning was my friends order which was the Pork Belly with Cheddar Grits Special.  The dish had us at Pork Belly.  But when paired with the Cheddar Grits... it was such a thick consistency and so flavorful that you just keep wanting more! I love how this is out of the ordinary.  I can't wait for me return visit!

When it comes to cajun/creole food nothing can compare to New Orleans.  But I have finally found something that comes close!  I had the best shrimp po' boy I have ever had outside of Louisiana.  Highly recommended!   It's not going to be easy, but make sure to save some room for dessert.  The beignet flight is a must.  I will admit this is the one thing that fell a little short of the original, but no one else can quite be Cafe Du Monde.  The plain beignet is probably the best, but the others are worth trying.   I went on a Friday night and didn't have to wait at all. service was pretty good, no complaints.  There are so many other menu items I want to try still!

// LOCATION // Tenderloin, a short walk from City Hall // WAIT // RIDICULOUS. Write your name on the chalkboard inside and then huddle outside until your name is called. Waited 1 hour for a party of 2 at 10 am on a Saturday morning. // FOOD // Amazing. One of the best breakfast spots in SF.     + Creole Veggie Omelet: Yummy and flavorful. The biscuit was my fave part. It was gigantic and so soft. I ate it with heaps of the house made jam which was hands down the best jam I've ever had.     +Andouille Sausage and grits: The sausage was slightly spicy. My first time eating grits and I'm hooked! Creamy and lightly seasoned.     +Buttermilk pancakes: Nothing special SO worth the wait.

Went here 30 minutes before closing time on a Saturday night and we were immediately seated. Nice ambiance and friendly staff. I had the fried chicken, and my friends had the pork chops and po boys. Everything came out on time and tasted great! The watermelon iced tea is a good pallet cleanser and great refresher! Highly recommended!!! The price is very reasonable for the hgh quality food here. I was surprised at the end of the meal when the waitress said that my fried chicken was free because it came 10 minutes later than everyone else's! Talk about great service and confidence in your food. I definitely will be coming here again.

This was definitely a place where the wait for brunch is worth it. Came on a Sunday around 12 with a party of 3. When I got there, I put my name on the chalk board and expected to wait and wait and wait. There was an entire column of names waiting to be seated before my group, so we headed to Philz a block away and made it back to finish out the waiting with our Mint Mojito Iced Coffees. Total wait time actually wasn't that long, about 40 minutes, since the restaurant is larger than most brunch spots. Good things - Hangtown Fry: The fried oysters were wonderfully crispy and the eggs were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Potatoes were a little mushy, but the biscuits...hands down, the BEST biscuit I have ever had. Rich, flaky, buttery--I would buy this to eat on its own! - Beignet Flight: It was my first time going and I knew I had to try the beignets. This one is a good choice when you like variety. The powdered beignet was probably my favorite because it was still surprisingly light and all it really needs is the fried dough. The chocolate beignet is one that I could do without; way too sweet. Apple one is okay, kind of reminds me of an apple fritter but I'd opt for the fritter instead. Crawfish beignet is something completely different, as it is the only savory option. Cheese oozes out right when you cut into it and the seasoning on this is great, as well. - Ambience: This is a lively and well-lit place for brunch. It's loud and filled with people and the casual environment makes it fun, as opposed to some other snooty brunch spots in the city. Not so good things - Cream cheese french toast with berry compote: This was so disappointing, and the only reason Brenda's isn't getting a 5. The bread itself was okay (though a tad dry) but the cream cheese center that was sandwiched between the two slices was way too overpowering. It wasn't sweetened at all so it was heavy and difficult to have more than a single piece of. Berry compote lacked sweetness as well. The honey whipped butter was probably the highlight, but we still needed to ask for syrup to offset the dryness of the dish haha. Overall, we spent around $45 (after tip) on four dishes. I would definitely come back again :)

I took a trip to San Francisco with my girlfriends and all my friend ever said for the few weeks leading up to our trip was Brendas Brendas Brendas so I was totally looking forward to this place when the time came for us to take our trip. All my friend talked about was the crawfish beignets so I had to try that out. I think my friend over hyped too much for me. It was good, don't get me wrong however I wish there was more crawfish inside and more sauce because it was a bit dry to me. We had asked our waiter for recommendations for what else to eat and it raved raved about the shrimp goat cheese omelet. We had asked him if we could replace the goat cheese for another type of cheese or take it out because we're not a fan of goat cheese. He said "if you get it without the goat cheese it's not worth getting altogether." So we ordered it with the goat cheese and I would have liked it without the goat cheese. There was so much in there that I tasted nothing but the cheese, the flavor was so strong and I couldn't taste the shrimp or the egg. Other than the goat cheese, the shrimp and the caramelized onions were really good. We also ordered the eggs benedict and an order of gumbo. Now the gumbo was good! This was my favorite out of all the orders. If you come here, expect a long wait. Come here sign in and go grab a cup of coffee because it will be awhile.

98% of their reviews are about their breakfast, but Brenda's is yummy good for dinner too!  Solid 4.5 stars! Tonight, I had the crawfish beignet (mmm, tasty, just spicy enough, gooey cheesy, yum!), fried chicken (so good, totally made up for some so-so fried chicken I had a few weeks ago, been craving good fried chicken ever since, Brenda's has it *right*!!), collard greens (mmm healthy, good for the eyes, good to eat the greens at least once a month), biscuit (was missing the butter, didn't get around to asking for it because I was full, had to pack it up), grits (buttery, creamy, yummy, looooove grits!!), and watermelon iced tea (I read in the reviews that I must order this, and I agree, you *must* order this, totally refreshing, fruity and just sweet enough).   Yeah, the service was ok, a little gritty, a little rough around the edges.  It's forgivable though, haha.  And the price is right - for all of that plus tip, I only paid $22 buckaroos!!  I had to look at the bill twice because I couldn't believe how reasonable the total was.   Love it!!  I will be back again.  There were so many other dishes on the dinner menu that I want to try....mmm mmm mmm!!

Every time I hear the name, I just can't help but sing the Tupac "Brenda's got a baby" tune in my head. This place doesn't need yet another review, but since I do love to share I will do my highlights... Beignets: crawfish is the best..wish it had more filling. The dough is cooked very well and does not seem overly greasy. The gumbo (chicken, sausage, okra, rice) was really mediocre...I added Tapatia sauce for flavor. Biscuits were warm, fluffy, & huge (i only managed to eat half). These taste like they must be packing like 400cal a piece (I wonder if I am right)...I loved the texture, didn't particularly care for the taste. Service: pretty good overall, but one of the servers could use an attitude adjustment. I mentioned that I ordered a biscuit when everyone's food had arrived and it was still amiss, to which this lady replied "I only got so many hands." Okay...good to know. Anyways, cool place to try but I don't see this as a regular spot.

You'll have to wait about 35 to 50 minutes. But otherwise this place is AWESOME. Service is hit and miss, but it does not take away from the food. Seriously good food.   Value for money..

Loved this place at the first taste of our Beignet Flight...  My fav was the spicy crawfish cheddar and scallion beignet (cheesy), Granny Smith Apple came in second, Plain Beignet third, and finally the chocolate.  It was like a present in every bite...  Melty tasty goodness.  Fried and doughy.. Noms!  This could have been the only reason for us to try this place...  But there was much more to rave about. We also had the Hangtown Fry (crispy fired oysters made the dish) with cream biscuit (moist and flaky) and grits (cheesy and savory).  My wife had the Grillades and Grits (rich and hearty - and it came with 3 eggs!). We also ordered up the Community Coffee with chickory (much lighter than expected, but still good - not like the Cafe Du Monde - French Market style coffee with chickory).    My wife had a mocha (she liked it). Service was attentive, and timing was great - very well managed.  They started us with the beignets, and didn't bring out the main items until we were ready. Nicely lit, high ceilings, exposed cement walls filled with large framed mirrors, very tasteful and simple decor.  Clientele feels like a mix of foodies, and locals that work close by in the civic center area having a quick meeting.  Closely placed tables for two that can be transformed for parties of four, some bar seating, not the best spot for a large party, but what you would expect for real estate in SF. I highly recommend this spot for a brekkie or brunch.  The lunch items (starts at 11am) look tempting as well... This place fills up quick.  Put your name on the chalkboard, and make sure your party is all there before they call your name (otherwise, they will not seat you).  Come early if you do not want to wait.  We were in and out within an hour, so our metered parking was perfect for the occasion.  Will be back next time I get a chance!

Really delicious restaurant in an otherwise ugly neighborhood. The layout is compact, intimate and elegant. There are lots of mirrors to create the illusion of space when in reality you're sitting in a cozy little restaurant. The owner is often there and makes sure that everyone is seated on time. I should take a moment to point out that this place is a victim of its own success and that long waits are expected for parties more than 2. That might not be an issue if it weren't located in the grundle of San Francisco. Anyways, die hard southerners aside, I think this place serves delicious grits and biscuits. The beignets are one of a kind and will make you sick if you eat more than one so beware ;) I've eaten the chopped veal on grits, shrimp and grits and BBQ beef ribs. The ribs were the best I've had in the city and came with delicious collard greens and Mac N' Cheese. M&C was so so but I enjoyed the meal a lot. Shrimp and grits was a little heavy with the cheese and light on the shrimp, and the veal plate was really satisfying. Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in the City. That is if you like rich food.

I love me some soul food and Brenda knows how to make really good soul food.  Today was my first time coming back after several months and they have really expanded the place.  It's much more spacious.  It looks great. I was greeted by the smell of chocolate beignets.  What a greeting!  The food was just as good as I remembered.  My wife and I both enjoyed our po'boys.  She had the shrimp and I had the oyster.  We enjoyed them so much that we barely spoke a word to each other.  Back to the beignets, of course we had to get an order.  We had tried the beignet flight previously and really liked the crawfish beignet but our favorite is the chocolate.  It just oozes rich chocolate.  Delicious!

I really wanted to come here to try the crawfish beignets and I sure was happy about it. It was sooo delicious. An order of it made me full but I always order too much food when I'm out of town (because I want to taste everything that yelpers recommend!) I can't remember the names of our other dishes but I remember that our breakfast/brunch kept us full all the way to dinner time!

"An hour-plus wait for seating? Really?" These were my thoughts as my breakfast companions and I stood in the middle of the Tenderloin, on a cold Sunday morning. As I was on vacation, I wanted to try the best of the best SF has to offer and plenty of people spoke highly of Brenda's French Soul Food - enough that I was willing to wait for it. At least I got the chance to snicker at the hipsters just waking up from their PRB-induced hangovers. But I digress... Once we finally got in, service was a little slow but totally expected given the mob scene, both the seated crowd and those waiting to get in.  Once we finally got our meal and I sank my teeth into my food, my reservations about this place melted away in a sea of creamy grits and creole gravy. Hot damn, this place is good. I opted for the Grillades & Grits, which comprised of "beef cutlets braised in creole gravy", along with grits, eggs your style and a biscuit. The cutlets were hearty without being overcooked, and the gravy flavored them just right. The grits? Could not get enough of them. They paired well w/my scrambled eggs - enough so that I mixed the two together to make one big file of breakfast excellence. The meal was so filling that I forgot to leave room for the biscuit. My friends were splitting a flight of bignets and the shrimp & grits plate. Though I didn't try their entree, I had a sampling of the crawfish bignet and, calories be damned, I could've eaten an entire plate of those things. Soft dough filled with crawfish and "spiced with cayenne, scallions and cheddar".  My mouth is watering just writing that sentence *drool*. Though I may not drive all the way up from Sunnyvale just for Brenda's, they'll for sure be on the short list for brunch options when I find myself in San Francisco.

Oh my.  That duck confit special made me want to hyperbole the hell out of this review.  I'll hold back. The Catfish de Allemandes was very good in its own right.  The fish was soft and flaky, with just a bit of seared crunch.  The crawfish etouffee had some nice spice to it, and paired perfectly with the pecan rice pilaf.  A great entree, but the star of the night was the dish I didn't order. Tracy W.'s ears perked up at the mention of duck confit by the table next to us.  Duck cooked this well is a real treat.  The meat was succulent, and the skin packed so much flavor.  The pepper jelly, which regularly accompanies the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken!), went perfectly with the duck.   However, I was honestly a bit disappointed by dessert.  We ordered a sampler of their chocolate, apple, and plain beignets (a crawfish short of their beignet flight available at brunch).  I know they were going for crunchy, but it came out more tough and dry.  The fillings were okay, with the surprise winner Apple beating out the heavy favorite Chocolate.  Not terrible, but I just don't think I would order it again (the possible exception being to try the crawfish version). The fact that i still give Brenda's a full 5 stars is a testament to how excellent I found the first two dishes.  I can't wait to come back and try as many others as I can.

One of my first forays into fine dining in the TL, I met up with a friend who happened to be back in town after several years of absence. First off, to clarify, Brenda's IS wheelchair accessible, so please ignore the fact that it says otherwise. Granted, it's a bit cramped inside, so that may pose an issue, but there are no steps or stairs that would otherwise prevent access. We ended up ordering a crawfish beignet for a starter, BFC and po'boy for our entrees, and a sampler set of dessert beignets for dessert. The crawfish beignet had some good flavor, but the dough itself was too dense and lackluster. Same thing goes for the dessert beignets: too doughy, and not fluffy or airy enough (go check out Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen in Berkeley if you want amazing dessert beignets). However, if you still insist on trying them, make sure to get the sampler, rather than ordering individually, as, for an extra $1.50, you get two more full-sized beignets. As for the BFC... the biscuit itself was awesome, the collard greens were tasty, the jam to accompany the chicken was interesting, but the chicken itself was not particularly impressive. My friend's po'boy was a bit tastier, but also fairly unimpressive. I can't really see myself making a point of coming out here just to eat here again, but, if I'm in the area and craving soul food, there's a chance I'd drop in, so they fall into the low end of my three star restaurants. But, really, there's better soul food in the Bay.

Too long have I stood idly by while waiting for the opportune time to try Brenda's dinner menu, too long has the TL dissuaded me from going in there at night, too long has the shrimp and grits played out in my head basting in the glory days of the weekday brunches when I use to work around the area.  Well its no longer too long, just too much....too much goodness that is. What finally got me to go was a friend's birthday which was going to happen at Chambers, so what better way to kill time and grab dinner than go around the block to Brenda's.  Perfect! The last time I came for brunch, they had already remodeled, but its good to see that some of the familiar faces were still around during dinner time.  And while you don't get your hangtown fry or some of the other po boys, they do have some things from the brunch menu which you can order for dinner as well. -Crawfish beignets - need I reintroduce?   -Oyster Flight - I love oysters, but maybe I prefer them raw.  Two of these didn't do much for me, but the voodoo one which was kind of like a bbq sauce was best -BFC with collard greens and biscuit - It's good, but not great.  I wouldn't put BFC as a reason to come here for dinner now, even though that was my reason to see how it was.  But that sauce that came with it was absoludelicious.   -Shrimp and grits - my dear old friend....how good it is to see you at the dinner menu.   Dinner vs brunch?  Brunch wins.  End of story.

Stopped by Brenda's on day 3 of our San Francisco road trip. We started with their crawfish beignet, which was fluffy and delicious. I opted for "The Burger" with goat cheese done medium rare, one of the better burgers I've had and at $11.50, it better be. Washed it all down with an Anchor Steam Beer, which wasn't half bad for a $3.50 micro brew. Brenda's is very much deserving of its accolades, but I had to bring them down a notch for a few issues. First, they don't serve ice with their glasses of water. Second, our waitress pretty much forgot about us after the entree's arrived; I would've gotten a second Anchor Steam if she were more attentive. Alas both my beer and my water ran empty without a single refill. Lastly, she again took much too long to return with our bill. We must have finished our meal and sat there for about 20-30 minutes before she came by to retrieve our empty plates.

In honor of the James Brown songs played while eating here I will write this review in James Brown etiquette. Woke up Sunday morning after a long Saturday night and had to fill my stomach with something quick. Yelped and found Brenda's and they were going to be open in 30 minutes. Read the horror stories about the line but if you get here on Sunday morning, when they open @8am you'll be just fine. Now to the good stuff....the food. Had the beignet flight and all I can say is BABY-BABY-BABY-BA-BABY-BABY-BABY-BA! Delicious and the beignets are a nice size so if you get the flight, you maybe landing soon because they will fill you up. Got a cream biscuit with a side of sausage gravy and AHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhh GET UP-A! GET ON UP! STAY ON THE SCENE! LIKE a delicious biscuit and gravy machine. Seriously though some of the best biscuits and gravy I've had in a very long time. Did I mention they serve fries @ brunch and not just any fries BOMB MAKE YOU WANNA KISS YASELF for ordering them shoe string fries. I left that place and I felt good but then again I knew that I would;)-- after tasting that good down home cooking. Also did I mention a bill for 2 was just 24.oo bucks(beignet flight, coffee, cream biscuit, sausage gravy & fries). Yeah if you haven't made it to Brenda's French Soul Food, you should make it there soon.

Great place for breakfast & brunch. Went here based on a recommendation from a dear team member. My friend and I usually do not like to go to the Tenderloin, especially not when not necessary, but we found trying Brenda's Soul Food Place a necessity. So we went. There was a line outside, as expected on a Saturday morning, although we did get there rather early (10.30am). The line went very fast, before we knew it we already got called in to enjoy some yummy breakfast. As loyal yelpers, we both checked out recommendations from other people and therefore ordered the watermelon sweet team, the flight of beignets (oh that apple one is SO good!) and the eggs benedict (to add some savory to the meal). The beignets were amazing, the eggs benedict was great, but nothing special (I mean, I know plenty of places in the city with great eggs benedict), the watermelon sweet tea was amazing. I'm not big on sweet tea, but I downed 2 glasses of this addicting stuff. Service is so-so, but I guess they can get away with it as the food is so great and of course, they try to get people out as soon as possible to have a higher turn-over. Overall, a great experience, and worth trekking to the Tenderloin for!

Grits is what attracted me to Brenda's. I never tasted grits before and was anxiously excited to try it for the first time. What I ordered: - Beignet Flight :   1) Chocolate, with molten Ghirardelli chocolate                                    2) Granny Smith Apple , with cinnamon honey butter                                  3) Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions & cheddar                                4)  Plain, traditional - Florentine Egg benedict on cream biscuits with creole hollandaise, and grits. - Hangtown Fry  consisted of crispy oyster, bacon, scallion, scramble with hash, and biscuit. I am very pleased with my meal although the wait was ridiculously long that by the time I ordered my food I was not feeling as hungry as I was before. Overall, I am a fan of grits now! Thank you Brenda!

Although the wait was annoying (45 minutes), the host offered to get waiting patrons coffee, mimosas, tea...don't forget to put your name on the chalkboard! Beignets were totally yummy. We got the apple cinnamon ones and took some back to our hotel...I got the fried green tomato eggs benedict with grits. OMG - just thinking about that meal makes me want to go back. Hubby got a pork egg dish and he loved it. Our waitress was on point, coffee filled, watermelon iced tea filled. Loved the decor. Would definitely visit again if in the area.

Brenda's is all the rage with all the foodies I know in SF.  Many out-of-towner foodies also think that this is one of the must-eat locations that make the short list.  I disagree.  Yes, the food is good, but it didn't blow me away.  With so many other great brunch places in SF, Brenda's isn't worth the long wait and expensive check.  Not that you should completely avoid the place either - just don't put high hopes on your visit here.   I came here with a friend on a Sunday just after 1pm.  Since they don't take reservations, there's always a long line out the door.  First thing to do is go inside and put your name on the chalkboard on the right to secure your place in line.  We waited for about 40 minutes and finally sat down to eat. The most memorable item I had there must have been the beignet sampler.  Out of the sampler, the cajun crawfish one was the best.  Other than that, the other dishes didn't blow us away, since we had very high expectations.   This place does offer an above-average beer menu of more limited-production premium beers.  Be sure to check that out if you're here.

This place never ceases to amaze me. There is always a line outside and rightfully so. Everything I've eaten here is LEGIT!! - Beignets Sampler - you can customize your own - Watermelon Ice Tea - Shrimp n Grits - Po Boy - we made ours half shrimp/half oyster! - Gumbo Overall, some dishes might be a little greasy, some dishes straight fried, but nonetheless AMAZINGLY GOOD. It's ain't soulfood unless you have both :) TIP: parking can majorly suck, so make sure to bring rolls of quarters because I've definitely waited over an hour!

Came here almost 2 months ago for brunch, super delayed in writing my review. I had never heard of the place (I am new in town..) but my friend said she had heard good things - so we decided to check it out. We had planned to meet at 1:30, though I arrived a bit early. There was already a long line, but fortunately I discovered the chalkboard and promptly wrote my name down. There were several larger groups ahead of us so I had no clue how long the wait would be, and there really wasn't anyone around to ask. Either way, after my friend arrived we probably waited around 30-40 mins or so. I was thankful to be a party of 2, because this place is small and certainly popular. I imagine you could potentially be waiting a while. Onto the important part - the food! We started off with the beignet flight, as we were unable to decide which one. Oh - I should mention, I threw my usual gluten-free diet out the window for this one (and paid for it later). The best was definitely the crawfish. I have a terrible sweet tooth, so took the chocolate one home with me (as we weren't able to finish all of them) and my friend didn't want it. It didn't re-heat super well, but it had chocolate in it, so I didn't particularly care. But next time I would just get the crawfish one. For our mains, we ended up getting and splitting the shrimp and goat cheese omelette and the egg and bacon tartine. One of us got grits and the other the potato hash, and we split that as well. I really liked the shrimp and goat cheese omelette, probably because I love goat cheese. And I've never had grits that I actually enjoyed, however I can now say that - when prepared properly - they're not half bad. Service was good. Food was good. I really liked the art work and the mirrors on the walls, it was a nice touch. All in all, a worthwhile experience.

Came here on Valentine's Day for Brunch...waited only 1 minute!---maybe because it was a weekday? Anyways, it was busy this day and managed to get seated ASAP! I had the hang town fry---omelette with oyster, bacon, scallion. Really good...especially with hot sauce! I had it with potatoes---good too! My bf had the Egg & Bacon Tartine..very good! it was topped with gruyère & tomato-bacon relish which i loved! it seemed like it was a sandwich..but other than that it was still good! the food was great and plentiful! staff was very accommodating! too bad i didn't get to try their beignets...next time i'll give that a shot!

I was so surprised to find this place as authentic as it is. The creole dishes are really tasty,  and made with quality ingredients! A local establishment that stocks both Dixie and Abita. I have to walk through the 'loin to get there from work, but it's worth it. *chainmail* The beignets are good, the chocolate is my favorite. Mine were a little on the doughy side, but it was Fat Tuesday and I'll be back on a "normal" day to check things out again.

Brenda's is a great brunch spot! It's a very small, cute and cozy place. The servers are friendly. There is often a long wait so I'd recommend coming here early. I've tried several menu items such as the shrimp pot pie, the shrimp grits, and the fried chicken. All were very flavorful, but I usually just come here for the beignets. The beignets here are an absolute MUST. The crawfish beignets are really tasty if you're looking for something savory, but I prefer the plain sugar coated beignets. They're fresh and melt in your mouth! Also, the watermelon tea is delicious. Cool and refreshing, and a perfect compliment to anything you order here.

More of a 3.5 star review. The crayfish beignet was large, spicy, & had a good amount of crayfish bits stuffed in it. The hush puppies, however, were almost as big as the beignets & not deep fried. What I remember from living in South Carolina were smallish-sized balls fried to a crispy shell, sometimes with jalapeno bits inside (depended on the region). These hush puppies were lighter & fluffier, almost the size of a pool ball! Guess they're trying to "healthify" it for Californians...or I just don't know how Louisiana makes their hush puppies. Always a long wait, have a beer while waiting.

I HATE line ups, but Brenda's is SO worth the wait. In my 48 hour trip in SF, Brenda's is hand's down the best meal I had!  Great Service.  Great Food.  Great Decor.  Great Watermelon Ice Tea (btw, I dislike fruit...ask any of my friends/family).   The Beignet is to kill for.  The Grits are to die for! Whenever I'm in SF, you can guarantee that I will now be found at Brenda's!

My friend and I got there and waited, and waited and waited. After about 2 hours of going bonkers over the tantalizing menu posted outside finally our name was called.   All I have to say is the food was worth every second of that wait! my stomach may have been furious with me for the wait, but after having the crawfish beignets, the gumbo, the cream biscuit made of sheer bliss, and those scrumptious grits, I was pretty sure I was more than forgiven.   I can't wait to go back again! So many delectable items on the menu and I bet they are just as amazing as the dishes I tried.

I don't think Brenda's really needs another review, but I couldn't resist writing a blurb about my brunch date a few weeks back.  We went on a Saturday at 8 AM and there were already a good number of people there.  I was really excited because I never really tried Creole food before and this place doesn't disappoint!  We ordered the crawfish beignets and that alone was worth waking up early.  They are large donut-like buns with a crunchy exterior and pillow-y insides stuffed with cheddar, crawfish, scallions and covered with cayenne pepper.  When I split mine open, the creamy cheesey goodness came sliding out.  I wouldn't mind if my whole meal consisted of just gobbling these beignets.   We also ordered grits and pork belly.  Loved the grits, not so much the pork.  Maybe I'm just not used to eating pork belly, but I thought it was a bit too dry and tough.  What really made the dish was the spicy onion jam sauce that gave the creamy grits a delicious kick.  I almost wish they left out the pork belly and just doubled the portion of grits. The sausage omelet that we ordered was standard.  Out of all the things on the menu though, I would probably skip on this.  But it was still delicious! Also, get the watermelon drink!

Cheese grits is my favorite variety of all grits and they made them with finesse at Brenda's.  I came here as a treat for my birthday.  I got a Bloody Mary and Shrimp and Grits.  The Bloody Mary came at a quick pace but the food came out a lot later.  However, I was tipsy so I didn't notice.  Dang you Asian glow!  Really?  On one drink? I asked the waitress about our food and she was very apologetic and said that the order never went through but our food would be out in a just a few minutes.  She bought our brunch for us and said sorry.  She was very sweet and I couldn't fault her for the way she handled herself.  It was busy.  It happens.  You know, just very rarely. My friend is a loyal patron there and another waitress came by to buy our brunch, too.  I thought it was very sweet that 2 people were so invested.  If that's how they treat their customers then I will be coming back.  Mucho love for this place.

Brenda's definitely knows how to induce a food coma when you go there for Sunday Brunch. The food is rich and artery-cloggingingly good. Tip: Go for a walk afterwards to make sure you don't fall asleep at Brenda's. My partner in crime and I got to Brenda's around 11:45am, put our name on the chalkboard and walked around the block to Philz Coffee on Van Ness. With coffee in hand to hold off our starving stomachs, we proceeded to the Philz Lounge to escape the cold and pass the time until our table was ready. After an hour, we walk back to Philz and with our great timing, we're the next ones called! Score! Even though I studied the menu beforehand, looking at all the food on the other tables made it so difficult to decide what to get! Here's what made it to our table: * Beignet Flight (plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, crawfish) * Shrimp and Grits * Creole Vegetarian Omelette The beignet flight was truly a treat. You can't go wrong with ordering these pillows of fried goodness. My favorites were probably the crawfish and chocolate beignets. The crawfish beignet was filled with chunks of sweet crawfish and cheese which oozed out as I cut through. The chocolate beignet was filled with rich semisweet chocolate and topped with a good helping of powdered sugar. Super yummy, but best left for dessert. When our main dishes arrived, as if the beignets weren't enough, I was drooling over the grits. For me, there was definitely too much cheese topped on my grits, but after getting through that, I dove in to try buttery grits and fell in love - I almost forgot that I had shrimp to eat! The shrimp were cooked nice and tender - only gripe I had with them was that the tails were still on and cutting them off was just a hassle (first world problems, I know). Loved the spicy bacon gravy - made a great pairing with the cheesy grits. About halfway through the meal, I was already dying from the richness of it all. I was able to finish the shrimp and took home the remaining beignets and grits. Overall, I didn't mind the wait since Philz was so close and you can easily pass the time there - just make sure you're back in time to hear your name called!

I had been looking for a good Cajun/Creole brunch place since moving to San Francisco and completely miss the one I liked in Denver.  I am so glad I found Brenda's!  It is a small restaurant that serves big flavors.  I recommend: * Flight of Beignets: If you are not sure which flavor you want, why not get all four?  They are quite large, so be sure to save room for everything else.  I never had a savory beignet before, and liked the crawfish and cheddar one a lot. * Hangtown Fry: This scramble had huge, crispy oysters that went well with the crispy bacon and scallions. * French Toast: My 6'0" omitting-the-weight-here husband could not finish the large 3 thick slices of brioche they served, even though it was so good with their butter pecan sauce. * Cream Biscuit: Nicely toasted and crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside. * Grits: Very creamy without the greased-up over-buttered feel. I completely over-ate.  And just like me, the the parking meters outside Brenda's tend to overeat coins too, FYI, so make sure you bring extras.

Omg this place is amazing. I can say nothing bad about what we ordered. This is definitely a must try, the wait will be long though. Luckily for us we went on a rainy day so people who wrote their name down and walked away never returned in time so a lot of names ended up getting crossed out. An hour and a half wait became only 30 minutes, cool beans. This is what we got: - Chicken, sausage, and okra gumbo I never had gumbo or knew what it was before so I didn't have any idea what to expect but I can tell you it was good and my friend thought so as well. - Croque monsieur The sourdough bread they use is absolutely amazing and really compliments the flavors of the baked ham and gruyere. We got half and half of coleslaw and fries, I actually liked the coleslaw more and although it wasn't anything special, it was still good. Fries weren't anything special and would just be space wasted in my stomach for all the other good stuff we ordered. On the side you get this cinnamon apple or some sort of fruit which was a nice addition and pretty good. Sorry I can't tell you exactly what it is. - Crawfish beignets This is a must order if you come here. The dough they use is perfect and prepared well. The outside is slightly crispy with the inside soft and a little doughy but in a good way. The crawfish are actually legit pieces, not small like bacon bits or whatever. The best part is when we ordered it we were only expecting one but it comes with three beignets! Honestly I think this alone is worth the wait, especially for only 7 dollars. It's refreshing to see such great food at such an affordable price. Being in Irvine for a school year away at home made me forget that places like this could exist. In the end, the total for the both of us with tax was 30 dollars (food mentioned above with a coffee and mimosa). With the quality you get this could easily be a brunch for 60 dollars at any other place. 2000+ reviews say it all, it stands up to the hype. Also, when you go to the bathroom, you can see Brenda working alongside the cooks preparing your meal, which says something about the dedication she puts in.

Small restaurant = long wait! Prepare yourselves. Raved about beignets -- only one worth eating is chocolate and crawfish ones. Service was good, food was good. I would definitely come back because there are a lot of other things I want to try, just don't have enough stomach to try them all at once!

When I came here I really didn't have any expectations.  French soul food?!? okay........ sure. Never even knew what a "beignet" was until I edumacated myself in this establishment. (it kinda sounds like Ben-gay.) The Beignet with crawfish!!! holy S!$#! The cheese just oozes out of this thing and the crawfish.....so fresh and so good.  One of the best appetizers I have had in awhile.  It's like Christmas in your mouth. I like grits.  Some people don't but I love it.  I got the grits with cheese and shrimp.  Mmmmmm.......delicious.  Even Chuck Norris would cry of how good it is. Great Food!! Come here!

I met the woman of my dreams, and her name was Brenda. She made me wait an hour for our date even though I arrived early at 845AM. You'd think a girl doesn't have plans that early, but nope - Brenda was the girl on the block that every man wanted to take out. She asked me if I wanted a drink, being that it was 930AM, I politefully declined. I didn't want to be sloppy and ruin a potential keeper. So instead she sat me down she served me her famous watermelon tea which was just the perfect refreshing wake-me-up on a cold SF Sunday morning. I was ready to get to know her inside and out. And she came with free refills too. Then to start off she served me her famous beignet flights (4 for $8): Crayfish - the best of the bunch. Whole pieces of amazing crawdads in a savory, strong, orange sauce. Plain sugar - I didn't enjoy it. I've been to New Orleans and had much better. Apple - skip it. Chocolate - nothing special. Just get the crayfish beignet ($8 for 3 I believe) and you'll be good. Skip the rest. Brenda could tell I wasn't feeling her 100% and so she decided she had to go hard and on the aggressive. So she brought out the shrimp and grits (about $12). The minute I laid my eyes on those curled shrimp and the melted cheese, bacon and scallions I was back in the game. Not all dates go perfect I told myself. So I dipped my spoon in and all of a sudden emotions rang deep. Memories of college parties, frolicking in the sand, winning the lottery, unicorns & double rainbows engulfed my Medulla Oblongata. This dish was to die for. Just when I couldn't take the tease anymore, she brought me a fried catfish eggs benedict. I've had many my share of regular eggs benedict and those ones are always runny, insecure, loose & drippy. But not Brenda's, but hers was in tact and the perfect texture. Another dish I couldn't live without (~$11 or so) Though many have not tried a shrimp po boy (~10), i've had my fair share and hers was nothing to disappoint, but at the same time was very similar to everyone else's. I'd say skip it if you've had it before and opt for something more unique. After the huge meal she served me I could barely walk. I tried to hustle myself out to take the walk of shame, because other men and women were waiting for their turn with her, but when my feet hit the floor I realized she had drugged me. Food coma or tryptophan, whatever she gave me.. it was a good feeling. I'll be back for a second date soon Brenda. Don't forget about me!

I don't need to tell you how good Brenda's is, but I will anyway. The beignet flight is wonderful, the crawfish/old bay and the apple are my favorites. The chicory coffee is tasty and Brenda's makes the best biscuit I've had since leaving Savannah. These are the only good down-home cheese grits I've been able to find outside of the south. This place is worth the loooong wait. Just go walk around to Philz and get some coffee while you wait :)

Brenda's was O-M-G-G (Oh My Goodness Gracious!!!) So good, it deserved an extra letter! To get it out of the way, what is not so good is the LINE!! We waited about an hour on Sunday after NYE 2012. But to make the wait a bit more bearable, there is a PHILZ coffee only a few blocks down... But once we got inside... Heaven!  It was perfect that we went here with our group because with 7 girls, we were able to try a good variety of things.  We had the Crab beignets, Crawfish beignets, Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, Shrimp & Grits, Beef & Grits... and plenty of their watermelon iced tea. It was a perfect ending to our perfect 2012 NYE celebration. Thanks Brenda's!

Although, I don't actually like where the restaurant is located in SF. I always order the Beignet Flight! Crawfish Beignet & Chocolate Beignet are my favorites!!!! And it definitely satisfies my tummy! The servers are really friendly, nice, and helpful. On the downside of this place is that the line is super long :(

On my last visit to San Francisco, my local friends took me here for some crawfish beignets and watermelon tea. They were superb! It was really packed and crowded, even though it was already after 2PM, but Saturday brunch was on and in full throttle! Since we were short on time, we ordered the beignets and tea to go, and sat outside on the restaurant's bench munching down our goodies. It was so delicious! I can't express how amazing my crawfish beignet tasted, spicy powdered cajun seasoning all on the outside, only to bite into the soft donut filled with some really flavorful gooey and cheesy crawfish fillings. Le sigh! It literally melted in my mouth. I can't wait to come back here and try their other dishes on my next visit! Hopefully I can get a seated spot inside next time.

Wow, this was one of the best brunches I've ever had.  If you think (like I used to) that beignets are boring pieces of fried dough, give Brenda's a chance.  We had the chocolate filled and the apple filled and both were wonderful. I think the biscuits were absolutely the best I've ever had.  They were incredibly tender and flavorful.  The sausage gravy was OK, but not my favorite. The french toast with pecan sauce was simply amazing.  Complex flavors and not too sweet.   Worth the wait!  (and there WILL be a wait...)

This is the most upsetting review i've ever written. I went with high expectations (thanks yelp)... The wait was actually pretty quick. But, that was the highlight. Actually, the server was great. She was fun, attentive and quick. But, she should have seen the pools of cheese fat covering everything and questioned most of the dishes that made it to my table. Bignets were ok. Too much dough, not enough crawfish Hushpuppies were the best part. Then, everything went downhill, and quickly. My parter ordered the fried chicken. It was cold. Not cold, as in it was under a heat lamp cold. It was cold, as in COLD, as in shockingly cold. It was colder than room temperature, which tells me that this was a potential refry activity that went awry. The replacement order was good. But, nothing to scream about. The mac n cheese was boring, but creamy (with a huge layer of pre shredded cheese on top - an unfortunate theme) My shrimp and grits should have been called. Grits with a block of pre-shredded cheese. It was inedible. If you want good grits, go to Broken Record or Front Porch. The catfish po-boy was a yawn. Bread and breading. The dumplings were a haphazard mess. It was AMATEUR hour in the kitchen. I think the food was well designed, but poorly executed. It felt like the short order cook at my company cafeteria was throwing food on a plate and smothering it in cheese to make up for the lack of flavor. And, if the chef was in the house last night - SHAME ON YOU. If you want great soul food, head to Front Porch. Lastly, on a good note, the ambiance and atmosphere were fun and made you want to stay. Unfortunately, the food did not... I may return to try the brunch. But, then again, I may not.

As I first walked in I noticed right away this was a popular spot. I thought  we were going to be waiting for at least 15-20min, however, we were seated after only maybe a three min wait. The entire staff, front and back of the house, seemed focused on getting people in and fed quickly.  Throughout the meal I was only without water for maybe 3-4mins. not too bad for how busy. Food came out promptly after ordering. The inside of the restaurant has a good feel to it. They  were able to take advantage of some cracked concrete walls, decorate them moderatley with large mirrors, specifically placed to enhance the splits in the concrete for an artistic effect. Food was deliciously yummy comfort food. I cannot remember the exact description of what i had.  I know it was in the house favorites section on the menu, and was something like; beef cutlets in a gravy sauce, served with cheesy grits, two eggs cooked to order. and a giant biscuit.  The beef and gravy was really tasty.  The chunks of meat were tender in a sort of spicy lightly creamy gravy and  the grits were cheesy and good.  I asked for my eggs over medium, they came to me over easy (too runny for me) hence only four stars.  Also, I ordered the sampler of beignets, for the road so by the time I got to eating them they were cold (I'm not blaming Brendas).  Still delicious but I'm sure they are better warm.  My fav was the crayfish with cheese and scallions amazing!! Overall very good dining experience. I'm sure I will bump them to five stars my second visit. Tough critics make great restaurants even better.

ohmygoodness watermelon iced tea, oyster omelets, crawfish beignets. Am I in heaven!? Breakfast gods looked kindly upon SN and me this morn for we did not stand in even a milisecond of line. Nope, walked right in and sat down. We felt blessed. This was one of my favorite meals of the entire trip. It was hard to convince myself not to order more than one entree. Should I go sweet or savory!? Ah decisions, can't decide, can't decide. Brain aneurysm! We did enjoy that watermelon iced tea. It had bits of real watermelon in it and really made me feel full of French soul. It was delightful and has been replicated in our houses since. I had the Hangtown fry as I can rarely pass up oysters (even if that means I have to skip the sweet potato pancakes and the shrimp and grits). This omelet was absolutely overflowing with oysters and bacon. It was such a unique breakfast food. Totally delicious and so filling. I could hardly finish half of it! On the side I had their grits. They were a little more liquidy than I'm used to but still so full of flavor and yummy. Hit it with some pepper and I could eat this for life. SN and I shared some of the crawfish beignets. When we ordered this side we did not expect to get 3 HUGE beignets. These mamas were at least as big as my fist. I couldn't believe it. They were entirely covered in seasoning; the inside was soft and gooey and full of crawfish. This was a wholly unique experience. We cut them open and dug the crawfish center out and licked our forks clean. Between the two of us we could only finish one. Seriously, so big! A transient outside enjoyed our other two. We saved the best for last. The homemade jam on the table was perfection. We put some on our plates and just spooned it into our mouths. This jam was made to be eaten sans bread-like vehicle. It was right to eat this with our spoons. I'm not ashamed. As unique as this meal was (borderline risky with flavors) we left so full and with huge smiles on our faces. I can't wait to come back and try some more of their awesome breakfast feats!

I was in the Bay area visiting family and one thing I have learned about my family, nothing brings a good time like gathering together with lots of good eats. Based heavily on my cousin's recommendation, we decided to meet up early on a Sunday morning at 8:00AM for breakfast. Brenda's French Soul Food's wait time based on reading many Yelp reviews is in upwards of over an hour. And YES she was right....the list of names on the wait list was beyond an hour after we left. But you know what, the wait can be worth your wait.... On to our order.....my cousin said everything was so good, so I trusted her to order for our group. We were a large group of 7 hungry peeps and she started us with 7 Watermelon Teas, 2 orders of crawfish beignets, shrimp and grits, fried oyster omelet, and a fried catfish omelet. Oh wait...two more conservative dishes for the less adventurous family members was the ham and cheese and banana topped french toast. Each main entree came with an order of grits and toast. BUT we decided we would eat breakfast family style so we would try everything. (See my photos) I will only write up on two of our dishes and the beverage. Only because those dishes and the beverage are the reasons you should make a breakfast trip here. But of course, that is really my Yelpy opinion! This is not your normal tea, it is Watermelon Tea with just the right amount of sweetness to tell you that this is not your normal tea, simply refreshing...please refill away! The Crawfish Beignets was simply superb! (1 order equals 3 beignets) This is savory orange sauce is the reason you want more! My opinion only, the Shrimp and Grits was the best dish of all our orders. Brenda's version of grits make me like grits again. The BIG QUESTION in my head was the last time I had grits was in Georgia at the local Waffle House, let me tell ya....this is not your normal grits. Brenda's recipe of complementary tastes of butter and a slight bit of salt for her grits made the shrimp in this dish melt in your mouth good. As for the other dishes we ordered, it was a up there with tasty goodness in every bite, but like I stated, the Watermelon Tea, Crawfish Beignets, and the Shrimp and Grits are the reason I will return. Five Yelpy Goodness Stars from me - I can't wait to return! ;-p

Has Brenda's wait time gone down, thanks to improved turnover and more tables inside? Am I catching on to this, only now? Efficient friendly service, once we were seated. Within the first five minutes, three servers asked us about drinks. Just wondering - is there a free for all for tables, or are they assigned? Regardless, the second server even gave me a mug for my outside cup of coffee. Still unsure if he was nice or simply protective. If the latter, sorry! Our wait had appeared to be another 15 minutes at least. My friend was kind enough to hold our place in line while I got myself a coffee. Fortunately she found a spot to wait inside and didn't need to keep managing the umbrella against the wind. Bring your comfortable pants. Brenda's serves gut busting portions and if you're at all weary of the wait, you might feel a need to try more than usual rather than plan another trip back. I gobbled up the Hangtown fry, which was not rich but still savory. My preference it had a bit of spice but that's soul food. Spice, if it comes, is typically hot or very hot, like the hot sauce on the table. The sides didn't disappoint. Biscuits were double sized and AWESOME. Few foods can make my day like a great biscuit. The grits were tasty, almost alluring too. They're made creamier than most and come with more butter than usual as well, so they'd be a good initiation for anyone new to grits. The flight of four beignets had great flavors of fillings: plain, apple, chocolate and my favorite...with scallions and cheddar and cayenne...crawfish beignets FTW! I will say that the dough was a bit thick and their consistency was closer to that of a hush puppy. Be aware. Regardless the meal was indulgent and a superb value, given the happy feeling left by all of the butter, cream, and whatever else. (Vegetable shortening?) Since our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, we felt immense when leaving, almost distended. We couldn't help but laugh about it in the car. I'd go back again, don't get me wrong...but I'd make sure to bring a huge appetite.

Their beignets were served hot and tasted so good! Although food was really good, our waitress was kinda rude. I was with my girlfriend and we ordered what we could eat. Yes, not a lot, but that is why we keep our bodies skinny! I really value service of restaurants. If the service was bad, I tip badly, of course. Some waitresses and waiters need to learn that they don't deserve 15% automatically.

I'm sad that I didn't have outstanding experience at Brenda's, especially after all the other rave reviews. Maybe I had too high expectations going in. I actually came here twice, but the first time, the wait was too long so we decided not to stay. The second time, we came for brunch on a Sunday. We had a party of three. I knew the wait would be long, so we put our names down at about 9:30. There was already a good number of people ahead of us, which is kind of crazy because I think 9:30 is too early for brunch. But by the time we got seated, it was about 10:20, so that's a better brunch time. The service was prompt and efficient and the servers were nice, but they're so rushed and haggard that they don't really have time to be attentive or very helpful. The restaurant is extremely tiny and cramped - they try to fit as many tables as they can in there. The coffee I had was amazing. I just got a regular coffee and it came in a giant mug with cream on the side. I thought that was the best part of the meal. My partner and I decided to share a dish - Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette. The biscuit that came with the dish was heavenly, but I can't say that there was anything all that spectacular about the omelette itself. I feel like it was sort of haphazard and all the different components were just there. We also ordered beignets to try. An order came with three beignets, so that worked out perfectly for us. However, I must say I was a little disappointed. Maybe because ours were just not a part of a fresh batch, but I thought it was a little overdone and not like the fluffy donuty pastry I remember from New Orleans. Overall, I didn't think Brenda's was worth the wait. If I were to go back, I'll make sure to go during off hours.

Get the beignet sampler and thank the Universe that they exist. Shrimp and grits was very tasty as well. Oh, and get there early.

The beignets are the real deal, especially if you dip them in your Community coffee. I'm from out of town and my boyfriend found this place on Yelp. Yay! I've finally trained him how to use the app. I'm so glad it led us here for breakfast. We had breakfast on a Friday morning, so there was no line to get in. The coffee is the chicory coffee common to New Orleans and was good. I like how chicory can cut the bitterness. We started with three traditional beignets. They came out piping hot, nearly crispy, and smothered in powdered sugar. The pillow inside was a perfect fodder for dipping in the coffee. The boyfriend even stole my coffee just so he could dip his as well. If I went back, I'd try the crawfish beignets for sure. I had the Hangtown Fry and he had the andouille sausage and cheddar omelet with mushrooms, scallions, and sauce piquant. The Hangtown Fry was a frittata packed with delicious fried oysters accompanied by grits and a biscuit. The oysters were the rockstars of this meal and were perfectly cooked. The waitress had mentioned she loved the biscuits, which is why I got it instead of toast. It was huge, and pretty flakey, but not overly flavorful otherwise. The grits were very smooth, nearly polenta-like, and buttery. I'm pretty sure there was also cheese in them. They grits were good....for grits, but I can only take so much. I didn't grow up with grits, so they're still a foreign concept to me. The alternative to grits are red potatoes, but the waitress answered that they weren't crispy, which is why I went with grits. They grits may have been fabulous for someone who loves, them, so I can't really say. He liked his omelet and I tried a small piece of the sausage. He really dug the biscuit and proclaimed it more like scones than scones we'd had the day before. The prices here were really good for the quality and the portions. I hope to make it back to SF to try other meals here.

Great food, poor service. We went on a weekday before noon so we didn't have to wait. This place is super small so the tables and seats are extremely tight. You practically sit on your neighbor's lap. The shrimp and grits and the shrimp po' boy were both amazing. However, I didn't feel the same way about the beignets. They were fine but not great. The watermelon iced tea sounded much better than it tasted. Plus I found a bug in mine. When I told our server about it, she apologized and took it away but never offered to bring me a replacement or another drink (not even water). It was not taken off of the bill either. Not that I'm looking for a handout but there was clearly no attempt to fix the issue in any way. Although, the food didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth, the experience certainly did.

I took the hubby and my daughter here for her 3rd birthday brunch. It was a Tuesday, found parking right outside and had to wait about three minutes. Brenda's is tiny but a cute place. Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs. We ordered the following: -Mocha for myself (Was a bit too sweet and not strong enough) -Flight of beignets - Crawfish, Chocolate, Plain and Apple (absolutely loved the crawfish and chocolate) -Hubs got the Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette (He wasn't a big fan of the sauce but liked everything else) -I ordered and enjoyed the French Toast with a side of bacon (My daughter and I actually shared this along with the beignets) Overall experience was great! I'd definitely come back here and would like to try their lunch and/or dinner.

So I wanted to give five stars but the host that sat us was really rude when my girl friend asked if it was possible to sit at another table... He made a snarky comment of "eventually people will be sitting next to you over there too"  but our sever who was super friendly and obviously over herd the comment and was embarrassed for him over compensated with great service! The food is awesome! I had the crawfish beignets which were super! And tasted my girl friends shrimp and grits which I loved! Plan on coming back soon and hopefully the host will wake up on the right side of the bed that morning :)

The wait... oh the wait... we waited about 1.5 hours to get seated, well probably because we're a group of 7, yet after that long wait, we still got seated separately, 2 and 5. We ordered: -flights of beignets (4 different beignets - green apple, chocolate, plain, and crawfish) - A MUST, crawfish was the best -Gumbo soup - very good, loved the spicy sausage in it. -Catfish Po' Boy - so-so -Sweet Potato Pancake with Butter Pecan sauce - bf loved it, but way too sweet for me I would totally come back here for the beignets, they're to die for, even after we didn't finish it, and reheat them the next morning, they still tasted so good, and still smell so delicious coming out from the oven, yes, it's THAT good. Oh I can't wait to eat one of those beignets again!!!

I am writing this review because I am CRAVING Brenda's. This is what this restaurant does to you--makes you want it ALL THE TIME. Distance makes the heart grow fonder right? Well seeing as this restaurant is all the way across the city, lusted after beignets and po' boys and oysters every Sunday morning.  And then I moved 160 miles away and I knew Brenda's was the love of my cajun creole life. Beignets are a must! Get the combo! 4 will fill you up, but you can't NOT try all of them. Savory and sweet; perfect flavor combinations of everything! Crispy and doughy and salty and sweet and creamy... The fried shrimp eggs benedict is to die for and so is the scramble with the fried oysters is soooo good.Thank god I moved away..I would be packing on the pounds with all the soul food goodness. Short review, but if I keep writing about it anymore I will start drooling. More than I already am.

Finally got around to eating at this well known place. Good vibe upon entry (and got a table right away, arriving on a Sunday after the lunch crowd and before the dinner crowd. Aim for 3:30pm). Nice simple decor, friendly efficient service. We tried the pork belly and cheddar grits, and the fried chicken benedict. Plus, the beignet sampler (4 of them). Let me tell you, that's a lot of food, and Brenda's food is all quite heavy. It'll be a chore to eat it all, despite it being mighty good. My favorite of the beignets was the apple one. Cheddar grits were lovely. It was the only meal of our day, and even at bedtime, we were still feeling full!

Post finals and we needed to indulge in fried and cheesy foods. So did a little bit of Yelping and found this place. We came here for dinner, and I loved it. I have heard great things about their brunch too, hopefully will check it out someday. Two people and we shared one crawfish beignet, mac and cheese, catfish po'boy, and gumbo. We were so stuffed afterwards, but we were also so happy. Crawfish beignet - first time I had ever had a non-dessert beignet and it was beautiful. The outside was just perfectly crunchy and the inside was all fluffy, like a perfect beignet should be. Then the stuffing was loaded with spices and steaming, hot crawfish. Dusted with cajun powder, this was a great way to start off the meal. Mac and cheese - tasted just like mac and cheese should taste. Delicious, gooey, and indulgent. YUM. Gumbo - came out steaming and this delicious gumbo was loaded with meat. I loved this because it was just the right balance of ingredients. Catfish po'boy - what can I say? French bread, crispy catfish, fresh lettuce and tomatoes. What a great way to end the meal. The catfish was so well prepared that it broke off in pieces from it's sheer weight. The outside was crispy and seasoned well. I topped this all off with Voodoo Dixie dark lager beer. Which was interesting, had a great hoppy, fruity aftertaste. Everything worked together perfectly. I think the thing that really stood out was how it was not overbearingly salty like a lot of places are nowadays. They let the flavors of the food speak for itself. Although I was full, I didn't feel disgusted like some other places. Overall, a great experience and a great weekend in NorCal.

Another popular brunch place  in SF. If you want good comfort food, then come here, but warning, there are LINES. Expect to wait. When you first enter, write your name and party number on the chalk board to your right. You should stay at the restaurant at all times since they will check up to see what parties are still there. Things to order: 1. Watermelon ice tea (+ free refills...so refreshing) 2. Fried catfish benedict 3. GET A BISCUIT (buttery goodness) 4. Gumbo is a classic 5. Freight (something like that) beignets!

We went on a Monday morning and were promptly seated at a table for two! About 20 minutes later, the wait was already 45 minutes long! Whew! Per the raving Yelp reviews, we order the beignet flight, shrimp & grits and the watermelon iced tea! The beignets didn't blow me away because they're just beignets. You can't really screw them up too badly! I did enjoy the crawfish and Ghirardelli chocolate ones, though! I absolutely loved the shrimp & grits, which were served in a very generous portion! Although my one suggestion would be to ask for a little less cheese. Lastly, the watermelon iced tea was refreshing and they give FREE refills! But honestly, I think I could make it at home. But just for the refills alone, it's worth the price. Next time, I'll be back to try their biscuits and gumbo!

The best breakfast of my life, no kidding! My boyfriend and I are visiting from Los Angeles and I did a Yelp search for best breakfast and brunch in the city. Brenda's came to the top and I knew after reading the reviews that I had to try the crawfish beignets, shrimp and grits, and watermelon iced tea. Wow! Those did not disappoint! Simply marvelous and incredible! The beignets were like soft pillows. The shrimp was wonderfully seasoned with wine and enrobed by a sinfully yummy tomato bacon gravy. And the watermelon iced tea was a perfect concoction of brewed black tea, puréed watermelon, sugar and Thai basil. My boyfriend ordered the special pork belly with cheddar grits, poached egg, and spicy onion relish. Out of this world! There was a generous portion of pork belly with tender meat and divinely crispy skin. This is one of those must-see places to dine in during your visit to SF!!

Came for Saturday Brunch with the expectation that the we would have to wait.  We arrived at 11:15a and put our name down for 3.  The place is a bit small which explains the long wait (aside from the many groups trying to get a table) and I would not recommend for parties larger than 4.  The wait is not horrible if you come here with that expectation.  There's a Philz the next street over so we got coffee after putting our name down.  Despite the extremely busy weekend brunch crowd, we got seated by 12:30p. With over an hour wait, we had plenty of time to study the menu and specials outside so we knew what to get right away: -Drink: Sweet Watermelon Tea - Subtly sweet and refreshing but seems a bit overpriced for what it is.  It's free refills so its ok. -Beignet: Crawfish Beignet - There are 3 beignets per order and they are huge!  No need to get greedy and order a plate to yourself because each beignets is pretty filling. -Gumbo - Got a cup to try and it was delicious!  After the beignets, I decided to share the cup of gumbo with my group to save room for the main dish.  There was plenty for each of us to try a few spoonfuls.  The chicken, sausage and okra flavors came together really well.  If you're not a fan of okra, don't worry.  There's no slimy texture in this gumbo at all and not one flavor overpowers the rest. -Main Entrees:  I got the Hangtown Fry with grits and a biscuit.  The crispy oyster is incorporated perfectly.  The oyster does not lose its taste amongst everything else going on with this dish.  The biscuit is dense and not greasy or overly buttered.  Eating this with grits is absolutely perfect.  My boyfriend got one of the specials, Pork Belly and Cheese Grits.  I thought the amount of pork belly was a bit lacking but he did not mind.  My friend ordered the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict with hash.  All three of us loved our food but after the beignets, we could only conquer half of our plates.  The food was so delicious that even eating them as leftovers was a wonderful experience.  The flavors definitely reminded me of New Orleans. Don't be discouraged by the wait.  Brenda's food is worth it.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner!

Visited San Fran this weekend and read this place was the real deal! Went up to check it out and walked out satisfied. The place is TINY and our party waited for 20 minutes to get a seat. Even though it was tiny, I still liked the ambiance. I've never seen anything like it in So-Cal. It's got the feel of a fancy L.A (I cringe at making this comparison because I know Nor-Cal doesn't like So-Cal) hotel restaurant but without the snootiness or ridiculous prices.   So the only other cajun/French food I've had was Lucille's BBQ (don't judge me) so here's my comparisons to the large chain: BISCUITS: Lucille's is a bit sweeter and they have apple butter. These biscuits were real homestyle and I like it a lot. I'll split this point between both. HUSH PUPPIES: Same to me on either end. I'll say Brenda's wasn't as greasy so this point goes to Brenda. BEIGNETS: You can't 'eff these up, but I'll give this point to Brenda since they have crawfish beignets with Brenda's spices  on top instead of powdered sugar. I've never even heard of any beignet like this and they also offer regular beignets (I overheard the waitress say they're more lenient on special orders at night so I guess they don't offer it during the day?). PO BOY: I got the shrimp Po Boy and yeah hands down better than Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen (Ok so I did eat at another cajun place, but this place sucked so bad I never went back) and maybe not as packed with shrimp as Lucille's, but packed enough, bread's soft and chewy, and shrimp was on point and the cajun sauce they use was delicious. Brenda wins. WATERMELON ICE TEA: Different and great. Where else can you find watermelon ice tea? Two points for original flagship drink. SERVICE: There was a mix up in our order. There were seven of us and only five plates came out. For some reason our order never got put in. I cancelled my order and finished my friends Po Boy. The waitress came out and told us she wouldn't charge us for the last two entrees and STILL MADE IT FOR US even though I told them they didn't have to! Man, it's all about owning up to it when you're wrong and wowing the customer. To me, this little mom and pop place went above and beyond! Lucille's has immature waiters/waitresses that have done the same thing and instead of doing the right thing, I had to call in the manager and do that whole routine. Smart people don't let it get to the point where I have to ask for the manager. So, all in all, good food, definitely an experience, and honest/good service. I'm recommending Brenda's if you're touring San Fran for the first time and you're looking for something unique!

Holy shitsicles.... brenda, you were probably one of the best brunches i have ever had. our table started with the beignet sampler and sitting there we ate the original, and the crawfish. The original wasn't all that great, but the crawfish...never had a savory beignet before but this was fantastic. oh my goodness. our meal came out before we could get to the chocolate and we kinda wanted to save it for dessert. I got the gumbo with a side of grits. The gumbo was so good. The best gumbo i've had in my life so far (NOLA i'm coming for you) and the grits... omg the grits.... you were buttery and smooth and oh so creamy. a little hot sauce and you were life changing. damn that grits. I didn't get to try the other dishes that the table got but apparently the fried green tomatoes benedict and the catfish po'boy was yumtastic! With a side of watermelon sweet tea and everything went down easy :D ohhhhh almost forgot the chocolate beignet! didn't have any room to eat it so we took it home for the ride back down to LA. BEST CAR TREAT EVER!!! when we finished all we could think of was how we wanted another... again.... 2 hour wait but throw in a little trip to philz around the corner and a trip to get some hooker treats and it went by quickly.

Came on a Saturday about half an hour before brunch ended. No reservations but we were seated right away. The staff were very helpful in getting us change for the meters and didn't even mind me jetting out real quick to feed the meter while they seated us. Finally, a breakfast place with good coffee! So many places skimp on this. We started with the beignet flight, which was superb, particularly the crawfish (they are indeed huge, as other reviewers have mentioned). The chocolate was very rich and intense; the apple was good but nothing special. I had the eggs benedict with ham (delicious) and my friend had the crispy pork belly special with cheddar grits (very rich and tasty). Overall quite excellent--quick service, attentive staff. I will be returning soon for the shrimp and grits.

LOVE the ambiance, service and portions of food/drinks. Highlights: Bottomless coffee and watermelon iced tea, beignet flight (sample of each, good if you're a first timer like I was). Also had the gumbo, thought it was good but not great. Got shrimp and grits and thought it was too cheesy. *broken record is much better*. I would come back to try other things on the menu but overall came out immensely full! Everything is hearty. Quick tip: Get the watermelon iced tea and be ready to be really full.

Ate at Brenda's on a fun-filled weekend SF visit--LOVED IT! Place: Went before the expansion opened but the place is cozy and clean, love the chalkboard and other cute touches as well as the awesome natural lighting. I'm hoping that the wait times will improve now that they've expanded--can't wait to show others this gem! We went on Sat morning fairly early a little before 10 and waited and hour and a half, but in my opinion worth it. It's probably better to have parties on the smaller side ( less than 6) but that may change with the addition. Service: Servers were nice and efficient, we ordered as soon as we sat down (after contemplating the menu for a good 30 min of our wait time) and got our food super quickly. Food: The beignet flight was BOMB. The crawfish one was superb, love the dusting of paprika seasoning and the creamy crawfish filling mmmm. The plain beignet was great with their strawberry preserve (AMAZING) and the chocolate and apple one were delicious as well. I would definitely suggest ordering the flight to share for the table--my third of each one was a lot! We also had the gumbo--chicken, sausage and okra which was perfect for the chilly day. Finally the hangtown fry (oyster, bacon, scallion, egg scramble) which we got with hash and a biscuit was filling and delicious. the oysters were great in the scramble and the biscuit was light and fluffy (another opportunity to break into their strawberry preserves :). Overally I would recommend everything that we tried--definitely one of my best meals of the weekend. There's nothing better than a good, hearty meal with friends and this place offers just that! Definitely try the crawfish beignets!

Now here's a breakfast worth the wait! After a weekend of eating much of what SF has to offer, my delightful hosts took us to Brenda's for our final meal in the city: Sunday Brunch. Arrived early, but there was a line, and a relatively long wait. The space is narrow and bustles with the buzz of a busy cafe. Once inside, service was prompt and attentive. The menu is awesome. Tried the Beignet sampler ( 1 each, original, chocolate, cinnamon-apple, and crawfish) which were rich, savory, sweet and all-around wonderful. Brunch entrees are generous in portion sizes, well crafted and flavorful. I tried the eggs benedict with both molasses ham and fried chicken; hangtown fry, and the shrimp and grits. Everything was awesome (biscuits a little dry) and there was plenty to take home for leftovers, if you like that sort of thing. Very good grub; makes me wish I could visit more often.

A friend of mine told me about Brenda's. She raved over the watermelon iced tea and the biscuits. After a visit there, I can see why she loved the place. For an appetizer I had the crawfish binget which was really good. Full of crawfish, cheese and green onions and dusted with what looked like Old Bay seasoning. It could be some sort of Creole seasoning as well. I had the BFC plate for the entree. Get this: three pieces of fried chicken served with a biscuit and collard greens. There is also their chili jelly which went well with the chicken. I had a lot of watermelon iced tea and it was good (free refills on the watermelon iced tea FYI!). For desert, I opted for the deep fried sweet potato pie. It reminded me of the old school McDonalds apple pie with the deep fried crust covering the hot filling. It was one of my most memorable meals. I will take my husband next time.

Disappointing. Ambiance really nice. Food was all overly rich and not very good - which is a BAAAAD combo. I sort of hated the sampler oysters plate. Three of the four verged on inedible. Collard greens cooked in lard were yummy. Corn prawn soup tasted good. Will try again for brunch...

Elvis is back! ...He ain't been here since his 2008 Post-Mortem Comeback Tour. "Well...since my figure left me, I found a great place to roll. It's down at the end of seedy street At Brenda's French Soul. You make me so hon-gree baby, I get so hon-gree, I get so hon-gree I could die...." (Screams heard from the Tenderloin derelicts) Thankyouverymuch. Since I was makin' another 'Frisco stop on my latest comeback tour, "Still Dead After All These Years", I-I-I-I decided to join up with some friends at my fav'rit haunt, Brenda's in the Tenderloin... "And although it's always crowded, It's better than lyin' in my tomb. Where my ghostly gut and rusted guitar Make me cry away the gloom. You make me so hon-gree baby, I get so hon-gree, I get so hon-gree I could die...." (Screams heard from the politicos from City Hall) Thankyouverymuch. I-I-I-I-I wanna tell ya that this place got all spruced up in the past three years. Looks almost as nice as my jungle room in Graceland. The table shared a plate of some big ol' $7 Crawfish Beignets (see photo) that made me think of my mama. Jamie W. ordered the $9.75 Sweet Potato Pancakes with Pecan Syrup as a chaser, which were sweeter than my Priscill...I mean, my Lisa Marie. "Well, the pecan syrup keeps on flowin', On them tater cakes sweet as can be. Well, I've been longin' for them good ol' crawfish beignets I know my love handles don't come for free. You make me so hon-gree baby, I get so hon-gree, I get so hon-gree I could die...." (Ed Lee screams like a little girl as he decides on a mayoral run) Thankyouverymuch. I-I-I-I-I wanna tell ya that I also had the $11 Hangtown Fry, which came with the biggest oysters I'd seen since I went fishin' in the bayou with the Colonel. It was mixed in with big chunks of crispy bacon and chopped scalllions, all in a fluffy omelet, and it came with a bowl of creamy grits and an even creamier biscuit (see photo). Why, we was so hungry we even shared some $3 Country Sausage Gravy that made us act like hound dogs (see photo). Uh-huh-huh. "Hey now, if your baby leaves you, And you're over 1800 Yelps in the hole. Just take a walk down into the Tenderloin To Brenda's French Soul. 'Cause you make me so hon-gree baby, I get so hon-gree, I get so hon-gree I could die...." And that's when I fainted...probably from being such a glutton for Brenda's world-class vittles. Elvis has left the building. FOOD - 5 stars...three years later and better than ever...the NOLA-style recipes continue to rock with big flavor and generous portions AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...they moved into the laundromat next door, so there's more room, but it's still kind of a squeeze in here...come at 8AM on Sundays or expect a wait SERVICE - 4.5 stars...attentive, responsive and friendly just like down-home Cajuns TOTAL - 5 stars...50,000,000 Elvis Fans still can't be wrong! ...and they're serving dinner now, too

Best sweet tea I've tasted so far in the city. I was really starting to miss my sweet tea (I went to Duke for undergrad), and I am so lucky to have Brenda's in my backyard. Not really a fan of the beignets except for the crawfish though. For my entree, I had the shrimp and grits, and it was mouthwateringly delicious. Spot on delicious.

The name says it all. Brenda's truly is food for the soul. This was my first time having grits, and I can say it was exceptional. I highly recommend the shrimp and cheesy grits. My friends ordered the fried chicken plate along with a side order of mac and cheese. Although I didn't sample everything they had ordered, I did try the biscuit and the mac and cheese. Both of these were quite tasty. They have 5 star potential but I feel that the service was a bit lacking. Although the restaurant was only partially full during my time there, the server only came by to take our order, drop off the food, then drop off the check. If this improves I'd be willing to add on that additional star.

Came here early on a Sunday morning to no wait.. yay! Super lucky. We ordered the beignet flight.. so delicious. I especially liked that there was a savory one, the contrast was really perfect. We also ordered the pork belly and grits, Creole veggie omelette, and french toast. OMG.. the grits were. AMAZING. The omelette and french toast were also good, and basically pushed the three of us over into wayyy too uncomfortably full. The vibe is really cute and fresh, the food is really good, and the server was friendly. Couldn't ask for much more :)

I'm a fan for sureeeeeee. I came here for my roommate's birthday dinner (party of 6 including me), and I didn't expect much because I'm not really a fan of cajun/soul food. My friends were already seated by the time I arrived, so I'm not sure how long they waited to get seated. Watermelon Iced Tea: I didn't like it... There are little chunks of watermelon in this drink, so if you're drinking with a straw, then some of the chunks at the bottom of the drink may prevent the flow. This drink tastes as if it was made with a not-so-red watermelon... Crawfish Beignet: I had some, and I really liked it! It was a little spicy, and it was only $2.75!! I'm definitely getting my own next time. BFC: Even though I don't really like chicken, I ordered this because it was one of the waitress' recommendations. I ended up really enjoying this dish. I didn't get sick of the chicken (usually what happens), the collard greens were pretty good (on the salty side), and the biscuit was soooooooooo good (my biscuit wasn't soft because it was probably baked more than my friends' but I liked it the way I had it much better). Shrimp & Grits: Everyone else at my table got this, and I'm so glad I didn't. It looked like soup (not what I was expecting)... No one was able to finish her plate, and if I had ordered this dish too, I probably wouldn't have finished it either because the dish looked pretty heavy. Mac & Cheese: I liked it! Thick cheese. I'm pretty sure we pissed of our waitress because we did our math wrong when paying for our meal with cash and three different cards... Oops... We could tell that she was annoyed so we bounced as soon as we fixed our mistake.

Service was terrible but the manager more than made up for it so they get a good rating.  We ordered the beignet flight and after a long while, it never came. Two parties that sat after us got theirs.  We asked and they said sorry, it'll come.  About halfway into our meal, the manager came by and said "you still don't have your beignets??  I'm so sorry.  You'll get them, and this meal is on us!". I would definitely come back because of the way that manager handled the situation.  It was over and above what we expected.  At that point we just wanted our damn beignets and to have them comp'd!  The chocolate beignet was my fave and the hangtown fry was ok... But I'd like to return and try other things.

I have never been a big fan of grits but Brenda's has made me a believer! Their take on Shrimp and Grits has got to be one of the best things I've ever eaten IN MY LIFE!  Its cheesy, shrimpy, and out of this world delicious, so make sure that you or someone at your table orders this. Other notable dishes include their Gillades and Grits, Oyster Poboy, and of course their famous Crawfish Beignets, but like I said above their Shrimp and Grits is where its at! Overall I would say that Brenda's is a must eat when visiting SF and should be on everyone's Best Things I've Ever Eaten list.  They dish up some amazing food that is hearty, soulful, and straight up delicious. Definitely worth the wait! PS. Make sure to get in on the watermelon iced tea with you meal, and if you're a coffee man then a premeal trip to Philz is definitely in order. Its right around the corner on Van Ness and in my opinion the best coffee in the city!

Heaven in the middle of.... Just moved to this area for work about two months ago and now kicking self for not venturing into Brenda's sooner.. Watermelon iced tea while you wait for table..score... Huge and tasty Shrimp Po Boy on first visit followed by what felt like cheating on the second... Was able to walk right up and side step the wait for a take away order of the best.burger.ever. Both visits had impressive and attentive service with charm.. Dining in felt like stepping into another dimension- a bistro in Paris and a nice diversion from the KFC on Brenda's left and the no man's land feel to the rest of the block. I dream of returning soon to try the beignets!

The location could probably seat 30 people or less. Very tight fit, but they are working on an expansion. So the wait was about 2 hours. If I was starving I probably would of been very cranky and given this 3 stars due to the wait, but after reading the reviews and knowing ahead of time of the wait, the bf and I had a hard boiled egg before we left. When we arrived they told us 1.5-2 hours wait, so we headed to philz coffee around the corner. The menu is very simple and straight to the point. We ordered two watermelon iced teas, the beignet flight and the pork chop special. Total bill was around 27$. Not bad! Watermelon Iced tea: VERY REFRESHING, they're very quick on refills and there are chunks of watermelon in every sip. You could order this while waiting too. Beignet flight: Plain, Chocolate, peach, and crawfish. Light and crispy and very tasty. My favorite is the crawfish one, and next time I plan on ordering just the crawfish alone. Great dish if it's your first time and you want to try it all! Pork Chop Special: Not on the menu but it was on the specials board. It came with one pork chop, two eggs, and sweet potatoes sauteed in onions. VERY FLAVORFUL. Portions were reasonable. The sweet potatoes were a great touch instead of regular hash. Food came out quickly and was delicious. The service is amazing, and don't be afraid to ask them what their favorites are just in case you can't decide. Even though it's very busy, they are patient with every customer. **If you don't like eating about a foot away from another table, I recommend not eating here but maybe getting to-go. Hopefully after the renovations it won't feel so cramp. **Went on a Sunday so street meters were free! Really recommend a Sunday because of this and the brunch is delicious! Egg Benedicts  are Saturday and Sunday only too.

1.5 hour wait for Sunday brunch for a party of 4. Darn, I was a bit disappointed in the food! Perhaps the wait was too long and the expectations were too high. If you're going to order some beignets, I'd recommend getting the beignet flight. It has a chocolate, an apple, a crawfish beignet, and a plain one dusted with powdered sugar. Something for everyone! Their beignets could have been a lot lighter and fluffier though. It was very dense! I ordered the Eggs Benedict which came with two poached eggs on cream biscuits AND fried chicken. Their fried chicken was okay! I heard it was some of the BEST in town...I beg to differ. You've got to try their Watermelon Iced Tea. I loved it! Freshly made with real chunks of watermelon floating around in your glass. Again, the wait was unfortunate and a bit ridiculous, especially when you have to wait outside in the cold. Good thing there's a Philz coffee around the corner!

Unlike other guests who had to wait for a table, we decided to eat at the bar so that we didn't have to suffer through an agonizing wait.  The server got our drinks right away and I actually liked being able to see what everyone was eating (the bar is in the middle of the restaurant and serves as a center divider).  The trek to this place was not the most appealing adventure. Just imagine yourself as being in the set of the lovechild of Lord of the Rings and Shawn of the Dead. You have to subject your nostrils through pungent piss and vomit smells before you can reward yourself with the sweet aroma of beignets and bacon. The servings were just the right amount. The potatoes could use a little more flavoring or spices. Their egg and bacon tartine was ok and there wasn't anything special about it. Just your regular french bread with eggs and bacon. If you don't like the sweet and salty combination you taste in a McGriddle, don't get this one because there's a sweet aftertaste to the tartine. The croque monsieur tasted great. The bechamel sauce hidden underneath the cheese was very savory. In fact, because my monsieur was tastier than the tartine, my BF kept digging into my dish.  It even tasted better with a couple dashes of hot sauce. The coleslaw that came with it was lightly dressed (which my bf thought was kind of dry) but I like my coleslaw that way and I thought they used pretty fresh ingredients. We were kind of disappointed because we read so many great recommendations for this place. We probably ordered the wrong items and that's what we get for trying to be a non-conformist. I would like to come back and try their benedicts and beignets since the Yelp Sheeple recommends them. Maybe I'll give them more stars if I just resist becoming a Sheeple and just order the same items as everyone else.

Seems like this place may be hit or miss.  I knew it would've been a miss had I ordered any of their beignets.  Seemed too big and after trying beignets many times from Cafe Du Monde i knew it would be no comparison. So I ordered the jambalaya and substituted the salad for greens.  Greens weren't the best I've ever had but resembled some of the better ones I've had.  Jambalaya had soggy rice and overall a lack of flavor. Maybe I'm being too critical.  Just seemed a little bit overrated for an hour wait.

Must get the Chicken Sausage & Okra Gumbo and Watermelon Iced Tea!   The Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict was also amazingly good.  Who woulda thunk friiiied chick'n would go so well on an eggs benedict?!? The crawfish beignet was disappointing though.  We were deciding between that and the seasonal crab beignet and we went with the crawfish solely based on price (it was a better deal - 3 crawfish for $7 vs. 1 crab for $4).  But I've never had crawfish before and it was too fishy tasting for me.  Other than the fishy taste, i didn't notice any other flavors that stood out; in short, it was bland.  But neighbor got the crab beignet and I overheard him say that it was delicious.  So grab the crab while you can!

Rough neighborhood with good hearty food. The beignets are truly unique at Brenda's with 4 flavors to pick from. Plain, Apple, Chocolate, and Crawfish. The crawfish beignets are savory with a hint of paprika and mixture of seafood deliciousness. It is a perfectly fried doughnut with a not so dense outer shell and is quite moist on the inside. For my main dish I had the brisket with grits, biscuit, and side of gumbo. The grits are some of the best I've ever had and went great with the gravy and the yolk of my sunny side eggs. The gumbo was really great in flavor but I wished it was a bit hotter in temperature and that green onions were not used as a garnish.

I don't understand why everyone love this place so much. Perhaps I need to return and find out more about this place. Or try its famed brunch (instead of dinner). Because my experience has been an utter disappointment. the beignet is WAY TOO BIG. It's the size of my 6'4" boyfriend's fist. It was covered by this red spice (old spice?) that tasted of roasted shrimp shell and way too much salt. The doughnut itself was way too thick, and too dry until you hit the goo I believe is the crawfish. The friend chicken was equally as salty, and nothing to write home to. I do enjoy the chard, and the chili jam, but that really is about it. My boyfriend's burger was unimpressive, the fries were dry and the pickled watermelon rind was simply too strong. Robbed entirely of the sweet residue I was hoping for. What a major disappointment.

Officially obsessed with the crawfish beignets thanks to my cousin and fellow Yelper, Faye. We visited a Saturday morning and there was a short 20 minute wait. No big deal. My best friend and I stared at the menu, and despite a recommendation from my cousin, we thought we had our heart's set on the chocolate beignets as a starter... and then the table next to us got served three humongous crawfish beignets that I immediately locked eyes on. The couple who ordered the beignets noticed me salivating and asked if I wanted to try it, because they had heard us decide on the chocolate ones... UM YES. After a small bite, I was hooked. I also ordered the bananas foster french toast. My best friend ordered the fried green tomato eggs benedict. I preferred hers over mine, but both were delicious and solid plates. The bananas foster french toast was a little sweet for my palate, but I should've expected that when I opened my mouth to order. Deeeelicious! Will be back.

THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! I can't believe I forgot to review Brenda's ... ANYWAY, there is a bit of a wait for the brunch but it's definitely worth it! Their beignets are sooo good, especially the chocolate filled one. If you've never had beignets, try their flight of 4 different ones so you can sample every type. Their pulled pork eggs benedict is VERY VERY VERY GOOD! so full of flavors and huge! I sampled the other breakfast dishes my friends got (unfortunately I forgot what they had) and they were all equally mouth-watering. I'd love to come back and try their dinner choices as I've heard good things about it too.

Very good! It didn't take me long to find parking and there was no wait, but the restaurant was packed. The restaurant's kind of small and isn't really ideal for large groups. They give you complimentary black eyed peas while you wait for your food. I ended up getting the BFC which is three pieces of Brenda's fried chicken, a biscuit, some collard greens, and jam while my boyfriend got the shrimp po'boy with fries. We also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese. For dessert, we ordered beignets; plain, chocolate, and granny smith apple. Keep in mind that it's 3 per order! Brenda's chicken is sooo good! It's not too oily and the batter was light and crispy which made it easier to eat the rest of my meal. My boyfriend's shrimp po'boy sandwich was also very good! It was a little bit too spicy for my liking, but it was yummy. Their macaroni and cheese? Well, let's just say that it was my favorite before I discovered the Front Porch's mac & cheese. It's ooey gooey good! The beignets are also delicious! Take them to go and go to your favorite ice cream place. :) Just perfect! Definitely try this place out!

Oh boy. Definitely one of my favorite San Francisco spots. In fact it is 6 am now and I had too much tequila at nicks crispy at underdogs and SO! I am just waiting for Brendas to open. Patiently. Only I ever got that was meh was the pancakes. After that I silently committed to the gulf shrimp omelette with goat cheese caramelized onions and EXTRA tomato bacon relish. Biscuits are amazing and don't forget to pile on the HOMEMADE jam!!!! Wow. It's like they add a tiny bit of cinnamon spice to it... So fycking amazing. Grits are good but I'm from the north so WTF do I know. Ugh now I can't wait!!! Ohhh and the only conundrum is this... Chocolate or crawfish beignets or both?!?! Like a pig. The dough is like slighty sweet which is just a stunning complement (not to be confused with compliment!) to the cheesy crawfish. Kill me now so I can go to heaven and eat Brendas.

Everyone knows that if you get to a brunch place like this any later than 9:30, you're pretty much guaranteed to pass out from hunger before you get seated.  Our party of 3 got here at 9:15 and we ended up waiting a full hour before getting seated.  Not bad considering the first time I was here I waited an hour and a half!  Only 5 parties had been seated and crossed off the list during the time we were waiting and there were already at least 10-15 parties ahead of us.  Those guys were looking at a good 2+ hour wait right there.  You've been warned!  As my one friend put it, this brunch place is all about survival of the fittest.  Most people don't even survive the wait time here. Good things happen to those who wait holds true at a place like this though.  They've got your standard brunch fare - your eggs, toast, pancackes etc.  But what I really love about Brenda's is their southern style take on brunch.  You can get an omelette anywhere, but the southern style twist is REALLY what makes this 1+ hour wait worth it.   The crawfish beignets are heavenly and are hands-down my favorite of the beignet flight.  They're savory, not sweet like the rest of them.  Though to the other beignets' credit, they're not terribly overdone as I've had in other places.  Just a couple hits of powdered sugar and enough sweetness without feeling like I just formed 3 new cavities. As for the entrees - I ordered the Grillades and Grits and whew, I could barely power through this thing.  The portions are extreeemely generous and the prices just right.  When I think beef cutlets, I tend to think of Denny's or like, Hungry Man frozen dinners.  But this is in a category of its own here.  The sauce is not too spicy as it is advertised but gives it a wonderful seasoning that takes beef cutlets to a fancy, next level.  The grits here are awesome!  I'm not usually a fan of grits - sometimes the texture gets to me.  But the grits here are so creamy and buttery and flavorful they're pretty much like mashed potatoes.  Oh and let's not forget about the biscuit! So flaky, so tasty, so delicious.   I am pretty much salivating writing this review.  Luckily I've got a whole plate of leftovers to dig through in a little bit!

We came for brunch during a holiday week so the crowd was still pretty thick. I have wanted to come here but the wait always makes me hesitate. Also, the neighborhood  adds some interesting surroundings to the experience.  But like most places I frequent, I come for the food. Gotta say when I have to wait for my table every minute gets taken out on the food. With each minute the food has a higher expectation from me. Our party of three had to wait about 45 minutes to an hour for a table. Glad to say Brenda's did not disappoint. We shared the beignet flight...seriously you could eat that by itself for a meal. Hearty portions! there were 4 beignets in the flight, and we shared each of them  there were 3 sweet ones and the crawfish one which was savory.  All had good flavors. We also shared the shrimp & grits as well as the andouille sausage and cheddar omelette.   Shrimp & grits were ridiculous. I could have had another full portion. It was that tasty. (remember I shared with 2 others) the portion is more than sufficient for one person. Andouille sausage omelette was nothing special but it was still good.  The biscuit was flakey and buttery and awesome.  The potatoes were OK...I would definitely get the grits next time instead if i chose to order that again. I'd love to come back, but don't know that i would want to come back on a busy day.

I'm a little pissed about my experience here... Maybe I'm the only one? We waited two hours to get a table on a weekday morning (10am-12pm) because this place had stellar reviews on Yelp.  I even had to call the hotel from our wait to ask for a late checkout.  I was totally hyped that this place's food was going to kick ass. It was mediocre, AT BEST.  The crawfish beignet was, dare I say, bland; and the others were aight.  The watermelon tea was nothing to rave about (I wouldn't order it again, ever). .... I just tried to remember what we got for the main course and I can't.  So then I tried to look through the restaurant photos on Yelp and nothing rings a bell.  It was just that unmemorable!  I'm sorry! The service is alright- they're definitely not the friendliest bunch but they are pretty efficient.   All in all, I kind of wish I had totally skipped over this place in San Fran.  I would've had another opportunity for a good meal and wouldn't have been late getting to Napa valley. PS- I have had good cajun food before.  It's supposed to be robust, flavorful, savory, and spicy.  Nothing about my experience here was any of those things. Sad face.

If you're on a diet, do me a favor. DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. I swear to God almighty, you'll get fat just by reading it. Let's start with the inevitable wait. It's a given. 20 mins. 1 hour. Doesn't matter what time of day, you'll wait. Call it -- building up anticipation. Either way, their food is WORTH it. On to the fattyness: * Beignet flight -- don't be the only uncool person in the room. Order it. You'll love it. The crawfish beignet is the best one and of course, the chocolate filled one was a heavenly delight. * Fried shrimp po'boy -- do you love shrimp? do you love fried things? do you love chipotle remoulade? If you answered yes to all the above, you'll FLIP out for this po'boy. If you answered no, why are you even reading this review!? furthermore, why are you my friend?! * Shrimp n Grits -- oh sweet Jesus. Ya'll need to get yo hands on this. Plump shrimp, creamy grits, spicy sauce and gooey cheese. Blows the Front Porch's version out of the water. Order watermelon iced tea to wash it all down. It was so addicting we asked for refill after refill. (after refill...) Brenda's food is definitely bad for the waistline but good for the soul. I love it, but my diet hates it. Then again, you can always start over tomorrow.

At 8 am on a saturday i'm thinking about good food and good service, alcohol? Not so much. So brenda's doesn't have any, so what. What they do have is highly refined cajun classics with a trendy twist. Pork belly and grits, yes you do want some grispy, fatty deliciousness spilling into your cheesy grits. Pulled pork eggs benedict, with a hint of sassafrass, an underloved herb that will haunt your tastebuds. Now i know their beignets are not du monde certified, so what, they're stuffed with spicy crayfish and scallions. The service is so smooth, even with one eye open you will be treated with delicacy and efficiency. First your beverage order, then the meal. Beignets come first and then the entree. Need parking $, not a problem. Water, sure. Anything else we can do for you? Yeah, probably my favorite breakfast spot, consistent excellence and smooth, smooth, smooth! Cheap too! I think $10 or so for a two meal entree is a fine accomplishment. So get up early, polk street is freshly washed by then and enjoy an uncrowded slide into your weekend.

YUM!  YUM!  The entire menu makes your mouth water. We tried to eat as many things as possible. There will be an hour or more wait to get seated but like one reviewer said, it will be more difficult to walk out.  It's a heavy creole breakfast!  Best grits I've ever had (I am originally from the South).

Food was really good, don't get me wrong- but there are afew things that have caused me to knock down my rating. My friend said her tartine was alittle soggy and had too much cheese. The shrimp in my grits were over cooked. The watermelon iced T was good, not too sweet, however the taste in glasses ranged from how fresh or ripe the watermelon was that they used. There are free refills which is really nice so we drank our fill, but we noticed that the watermelon was bad in one of our refills. The food you cook is only as good as the ingrediants you use. The staff worked very fast, but alittle too- making me feel alittle rushed. The waitress asked us around four times if we were ready to order in a 5min interval. Multiple waitresses serve you which is no problem, however a new asian waitress was incredibly rude to us when we asked her if she could split our bill. We didn't ask her to print out a seperate bill for us, we simply gave her two cards and asked her nicely *once in a blue moon we have a girls day and we always do this wherever we go and everyone has done so gladly* It almost seemed like she was furious and made it clear that she was really upset and would only do it this once. My friend appologised saying she was sorry and that she didn't think she would get so mad. She said she was new and she took along time, so maybe she didn't know how to do it? But she could have gotten someone else to help her, especially if she was in training. The food was good but pretty heavy. There are two sides to the place so it's actually pretty spacious for the area and the interior is nice. The location is strange. All in all it was a nice experience, and we wanted to try out a new place. I've wanted to go here since i discovered on yelp, but it is just alittle over-hyped i think. Probably won't be back, though i do not regret going.

This place has quite the menu. The shrimp and grits was quite tasteful but definitely goes on my 'heavy foods' list. There was only so much I could take. Crawfish beignets came in 3 (which I was not aware of) so it was quite fulfilling considering that was the first thing that came out. Oyster Po Boy was HUGE! I counted 10 oysters altogether. Great value but I wouldn't say it was the best po boy I've had. I had the watermelon iced tea which is probably the best tea I've had! The wait is quite long and I know some first-timers didn't know that you have to go in and put your name on the chalkboard. Parking is on the street.

Maybe I've gotten spoiled by the best Creole food in the Bay Area at OB's Coffee Cafe in Oakland, but Brenda's did NOT live up to the billing on my recent visit.   As a Louisiana-raised, CA transplant, Brenda's WAS one of my first favorite restaurants in SF, and I WAS looking forward to re-visiting after their recent expansion.  I'm afraid they may have cut some corners to pay for said expansion. They no longer serve the Cafe du Monde chicory coffee, and have replaced it with Community Coffee, which is roasted in Lafayette, LA (my hometown), but not as intensely flavored as the Cafe du Monde coffee. The shrimp and grits were, frankly, disappointing.  Sorry, but cheesy grits are not simply grits with cheese on top of them as these were.   The gumbo I ordered was unfortunately mostly just okra.  I MAY have had a couple pieces of chicken and a piece of sausage in my cup, but mostly just okra.  Good flavor though. Had I rated Brenda's a year ago, it would be either 4 or 5 stars and well worth the wait.  Now, however, this three-star rating, I think, is generous. Get it together guys; you will only thrive off a previously built reputation for so long. If you want truly heavenly Creole food, venture over to OB's in Oakland.  Read the reviews first though so that you don't risk getting kicked out of the place.

Unassuming outside, beautiful inside, the best staff in all the places we visited in SF. Randomly found this place online recommended and we had our first meal here on hitting the ground from Chicago. Had the catfish po'boy and it was perfect! Vowed to come back for breakfast, had chocolate beignets and a goddamn crayfish beignet! It was the most delicious thing I think I've ever eaten!

Pros: - incredible menu of authentic New Orleans cuisines that's backed up with authentic, high-quality flavor. - homemade cream biscuits are a must - homemade jam on all the tables - a separate beignet menu, both savory and sweet! - beautiful and comfortable ambience --brick walls, black and grey interior, classy but casual - fast service - can just write your name/# in party on the chalkboard wall by the hostess stand, don't have to wait for the busy staff to take notice of you/wait in line Cons: - stressed wait staff makes them hurried and not overly-friendly (but very efficient!) - cheesy grits a bit too cheesy, but still delicious Overall: Perfectly delicious and authentic soul food. Go, then go again to try more things on their menu. Great for breakfast, lunch AND dinner!

Be prepared to wait about an hour for breakfast/brunch hours and be filled with heavy fried food goodness. They have fried chicken..fried beignets... fried everything. Overall, not a place I'd wait an hour to come eat at, more of a place to bring out of town-ers for the environment and 'french soul food' menu choices.

The food here is amazing!!  Waiting an hour for brunch is so worth it!  The watermelon tea was delicious, with actual watermelon in it.  We ordered beignet flight, shrimp & grits, hangtown fry and a side of pancakes and an extra biscuit .   These beignets were huge, with 4 different varieties.  While I luv chocolate, the other beignets totally beat the chocolate one.  The crawfish beignet was the best, followed closely by the Granny Smith Apple.  The biscuit was perfect, fluffy yet crisp.  It melted in my mouth.  The pancakes had the right amount of air.  The shrimp & grits was so flavorful and filling.  I was also eyeing the hangtown fry, with the oyster and bacon scramble.  The scramble was basically like an omelet, which I will totally get the next time I'm here.

Late this morning and on a very hungry stomach, we started to look for a brunch place, and came across Brenda's on Yelp. A quick look at the menu intrigued us, and even the possibility of a 1 hour wait didn't detract...So we headed to Polk Street, ready to join the crowds of people looking for a brunch place on Easter Sunday. We did have to wait the hour, but it flew, as we perused the special's menu and debated on which ones to order...The crispy pork belly on cheddar grits with a spicy relish, the pulled pork eggs benedict with hash, or the catfish po-boy...The beignets were not even a question, and the creole bloody mary - did that mean Smokra?!? We were seated in the far right corner, and were amazed at the light and airy feeling of the restaurant - i felt like i had stepped out of San Francisco, and headed south. Even the abruptness of the waitress rolled off of us... I ordered the bloody mary while my boyfriend ordered a lager. The bloody mary is light on the alcohol, but the reason why this one goes down in history is that I actually ate the okra that rested on the ice - and I haven't eaten okra in 20+ years and wait for it, I actually really liked it. Where has this okra been all my life! We started with the flight of beignets - each one of us had our favorite, but by far the crawfish etouffe was my favorite - just the right amount of spice, and the beignet was light and fluffy. My son fell for the Apple which harkened back to an old fashion apple pie - a little tart, and my boyfriend prefered the plain beignet - which was authentic in its balance of powdered sugar and brown sugar. The crispy pork belly just melted in your mouth, and the spicy relish added just the right acidity to counter the cheesy grits. The plate was a little daunting when it first came to the table, but my boyfriend finished off every last bite - and discovered grits in a whole new light. I always love myself an eggs benedict, and this one called out to me because of the combination of pulled pork sititng on a biscuit, nestling a poached egg and topped with a creole hollandaise. The kitchen did not skimp on the pulled pork, and the hollandaise had just enough kick to cut through the fat of the meat - truly delicious. We rolled out of Brenda's debating a walk in the park or a nap, and what we would try the next time we came. So come hungry and ready to wait, because it's definitely worth it!

I work right down the street from Brenda's and I always wondered what the long line was for when I would pass by it.  My coworkers suggested we go there one day (for an early long work break) for breakfast.  We got there are 8:30ish in the morning and were seated immediately.  The place  was pretty crammed before the remodel (haven't been since the remodel, so it might be a bit better), but we were fine sitting snuggly next to one another.  I ordered the andouille sausage and cheddar omelet with a side of potato hash and cream biscuit.   Delicious! The serving size is rather large and very filling.  But, let's talk about the biscuits... damn! Its light and fluffy goodness with Brenda's homemade jam, just melted away in my mouth. It was sooo mouth watering! Another time I went there, I got the Egg & Bacon Tartine, which was also a pleasant burst of happiness in my mouth.   The wait may be long (I've never been there for a late lunch or dinner), but if you get there early enough, you should be fine.  Even if you do wait, the food is freakin' scrumptious, so it will make you forget about the wait outside.  The service is fine; they take your order, get you your food, the normal routine.  But the food is just remarkable.. I can already smell and taste that southern soulfulness smothering my tastebuds in delight.  I think I might just go there tomorrow for lunch!

A tasty breakfast spot! Best to come as early as possible to avoid the crowds.  The best time to go is when you have friends visiting from the East Coast. If they fly in Friday night, they may be jet-lagged and wake up early on Sat morning. What better way to kick off the weekend than indulging in this yummy food? We got the plain beignet, the goat cheese/shrimp omelette, and the pancake special which was pumpkin pancakes. The portions were BIG, we couldn't finish. I could go without the beignet in the future, but you have to try it once. The pumpkin pancakes were the standout. YUM!

Went here based on Yelp reviews and it is close to where I was staying. Went on a Thursday morning around 9 am. No wait. Place is clean and menu is simple. I tried the veggie omelet with grits and biscuit. I am not a grits fan but based on the Yelp reviews - thought I would try them. Excellent but I think that much of the flavor was from the butter (you could see it gathering on the sides of the cup). I got over the unhealthy butter situation and real enjoyed them. The biscuit was super fresh and awesome - crunchy outside, soft inside - really good, best that I've had in a while. Omelet was OK, could have used more veggies and less oil. Coffee was good and waitress was really good at refilling my cup. I want to go back ... Will be on my list for next trip to SF.

Okay, here's the deal: There's brunch, and then there's Brenda's! No stay or living in the city would be complete without trying Brenda's. Everything done here is done right and it's done big. The crawfish beignets are mouth-waterng. A flight of them alone could be an entree for someone, but why would you only eat their beignets, right? If you have a group of three, do an order of the beignets (one a piece), and proceed to order something off their brunch menu. I've tried the hangtown fry, the brisket and grits, and the shrimp and grits. My favorite, hands-down, are the shrimp and grits. Really, you cannot ask for a better combination of cheesy grits, chopped bacon, tomato, and drizzled yummy bacon oil on top. Also, the service is great. They're always smiling and they know the menu like the back of their hand. The place is a little tight so that's something to note (leave the big, puffy jacket at home when you come here). But, once you have your food in front of you, you won't really notice how close the other table is to you - all you see is food and all you do is want to eat it! Trust me, this place will change your life. But just don't rely on my review, read everyone else's, or ask the many people who wait 30-90 mins every day just to get a table! Tip: On weekends, get here early (like 9:00 am) or be forced to wait like 45-90 mins for a table. Early bird gets the worm. You snooze you lose . . . I think you get the idea now.

Not worth going trust me. I dont understand why this place gets such great reviews. The grits are soaked in butter, after 3 spoonfuls it was enough. The beignets were greasy and nothing out of this world. I would advise no one to come here on a weekend. There is a line out the door (because the place is very tiny) and there is no parking outside.

There has been so much raving about this place that I had to come here myself and try it out. I came 9am on a weekend and it was packed. We had to wait a good 30 minutes I believe before we got seated. I was late on meeting up my friends but they had already called us but would not let us sit unless the whole party was here. I was outside contemplating for the LONGEST time what I wanted to eat. I swear I wanted to try everything because everything sounded so good! My friend told me to try something that is on the Brunch menu but it not on the breakfast menu, which is pretty smart. That helped me eliminated a couple, but I was still contemplating. I know I wanted the flight of beignets forsure and I finally decided on the applesausage omlettle that came with potatoes and toast. The beignets came first and I split it w/ my friends, the one i really really wanted to try was the Crawfish one and it was hot warm and tasty yummmyyy!! When I pop that thing open, goodness spilled out! Delsih in my mouth! I also ate the chocolate one and it was pretty tasty, it wasn't so good when it's cold so eat it when it's hot! As for the omelet, I thought it was a pretty small omelet compared to other omelets that I've had but I ended up having a hard time eating everything! I was surprised, I guess they stuffed that omelet up for me :) I want to come back and try their other interesting things on the menu! We also asked the waiter if Brenda was actually in the kitchen and she was actually back there cooking the food for everyone in the place! That's so amazing that we got to see her working hard! Makes this place super more authentic in my book. I will definitely come back for more!

This place is to die for good!!! I've been to Louisiana multiple times and didn't have food prepared this well. My recommendation: Try the specials. Everyone in my party of 7 who had the specials were very happy. I had shrimp and grits, this was amazing!  As an appetizer I had gumbo, but the smaller size cup of it I ordered could have been a meal itself. The oysters that my friend ordered were perfect, as he put it, turned someone who didn't like oysters before to someone that loves them. Highly recommend this. I'd say if you only have 1 day in San Francisco, eat here.

Everything we had was good totally worth the wait! Make sure before you go you take enough change as the parking meters do not accept cards and meter only gives you 5  min. for  .25c you may have to wait 30-45 minutes before you go in and enjoy the delicious food.  We ordered the Crawfish Beignet  as an appetizer  it was gooey cheesy  good! we thought it was just one but every order has 3 beignets so I wished I would of ordered the option to have one of each. My partner ordered Hangtown Fry with grits it was good but definitely for seafood lovers it comes with a cream biscuit paired with their home made jelly  was one of the best biscuits and jelly I have ever tried. I ordered the Shrimp & Grits as this lady was raving about it as we waited outside the grits where so velvety smooth, smothered with cheese and creole shrimpy goodness and just the right amount of kick!

Cheesy SHRIMP + GRITS Crawfish beignets CHEESY PORK BELLY + GRITS (was a special). They make grits good.  Everything is tasty, I do not remember what else I had - But it was good for sure. The wait time got better as they expanded.  But if you want brunch... still go early!!  Dinner time is better.

Decent enough, but this Louisiana boy wasn't that impressed.  We went early, so only had to wait HALF an hour.   Then we sat without menus for 15 minutes.  I finally turned to a waitress holding a stack of them.  Without even looking in my direction, she told me to hold on and proceeded to slowly spread them across another empty table.  Then she had the gall to wonder why we were bothering her. Do empty tables tip?  Do empty tables get hungry?   I won't be back.

My second trip to Brenda's and it just gets better. Her food is as unique as Brenda being Filipino-Creole. She has tricked out New Orleans cuisine with things like crawfish beignets and sweet potato pancakes. Go early because there is always a line and they don't take reservations. It's worth the wait!

I came here for dinner (I have not been here for brunch yet). I think I probably would have enjoyed brunch more. Or maybe I would have enjoyed a different dish better than what I ordered. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which were tasty, but WAY too cheesy for my liking. It was such a rich tasting dish that I couldn't consume it all. I felt like 50% of the dish was just pure cheddar cheese. The shrimp were tasty, and the grits underneath were as well. I keep hearing how good the fried chicken is here, and I think I would have been pleased with that instead. Other than that, the staff was great, wine was enjoyable, service was pretty good (didn't come to our table very much), and this place was crowded on a week night. I'll come back, next time for brunch!

This is the best place in the world. the food was delish!! its been weeks and I'm still drooling over their food. I came for an early dinner before a show. of course there was already a wait. brendas is a relatively small restaurant, but well worth it.. the service, was okay. our waitress wasnt very friendly, she kinda just took our order and gave us the bill. eh about that, but the food will make up for her. my party ordered the crawfish shrimp and grits. so good. brendas takes grits to a whole new level. the crawfish beignets were also very good. the bf could have had them alone for a meal they were so good. the gumbo...the pork chops...and as nerdy as this sounds...zomg the watermelon iced tea. I have to come back to try the brunch.

It's my first time trying soul food. Right before the Sara Barielles concert, friends + i picked out this wonder on yelp. We were super lucky when we wrote our names on the chalkboard and waited only 5 minutes because the 3 parties before us left because they didnt appreciate how THANKFUL THEIR TASTEBUDS WOULDA BEEN! The seating was tight but the atmosphere was great. We could tell how busy and flustered the waitresses seem but they never failed to address us politely and really give outstanding customer service. Ok Food time: I don't recommend ordering an entree for yourself because soul food is notably heavy and you'll get sick of eating the same dish. Go with friends and have yourselves order different entrees and do it family style. Appetizers: We could've done without the crawfish beignets. It's aesthetically pleasing, plumpy, rolled in creole seasoning and really has the potential to be lovely but I found it too thick/dry and the filling didn't compensate. MY FRIENDS though liked the filling :) And I enjoyed dipping the beignet in the gumbo. The gumbo is great. It tasted like smokey beef jerky and had a unique orleans kind of kick; just like authentic cajun food. The meat was moist and reminded me of the can of catfood you were curious about because it smelled so delicious. For the main entrees: I ordered and pushed the shrimp and cheddared grits because I had to convince my friends that grits are amazing no matter what they say. Well they bought it this time and this was the creamiest grits I've had. I really did like the gritty instant made consistencies but this one was almost like mashed potatoes and the cheddar was an excellent combo. Topped with sweet tomato sauce and sauteed shrimps. WOW This dish was amazing, orgasmic, unbelievable. I can't stress it enough, I'm sorry I am salivating and jizzing as I type.. Fried Chicken. Thumbs up! Not my choice because I actually don't like the krispy chicken skins (oh how could I?) But the meat was juicy and moist and you always take the risk it'd be dry whenever you order chicken. Personally, I went to town on the collard greens. Kudos! We chose the catfish po boy and it was super. Nothing notable but it is tricky to share. Slap some hot sauce and dip it in the grits. PUT GRITS ON EVERYTHING. That's it. I hope to someday try it for lunch or brunch :) I regret not ordering the watermelon tea because I only hear great things about it. PS.. I didn't know of such thing as French Soul Food.

The food is good and the menu is really unique. Four different servers came over to ask if we had ordered our drinks but then I was pretty disappointed to have to wait 40 minutes to get our food. I feel like maybe they forgot about us, but they didn't say anything. I love the decor and atmosphere. The tables are close together and cozy. You sign in on the big chalkboard at the front. Don't be intimidated by the long list, the turnover seems pretty quick, at least it was on a Monday for brunch.

Under the philosophy of  "Treat yo self" (you Parks and Rec fans will get this shout out), I decided to spend my birthday day doing exactly that. i went shopping, treated myself. And I thought the best way to end "treat yo self" day was to head to Brenda's and FINALLY try them out! Since I went for lunch, which was way less packed then brunch and breakfast. Thankfully they serve lunch and breakfast until 3pm so I was able to have a huge variety to choose from. We walked in and were immediately seated. After getting our teas, we were free to browse the menu. To tell you the truth, everything looked delicious. I wanted everything in my mouth (that's what she said..haha) but I went for the creole veggie omelet and my friend went for their burger. The decor of the place is very simple but chic. The just expanded Brenda's so it's pretty roomy now, I heard it was super tiny before. They have giant mirrors surrounding one of the walls and I loved the attention to details- like the fact that utensils are kept in sugar cane and Cafe Du Monde tins. Now onto the most important thing's food! the veggie omelet was amazing. It was packed with veggies and gooey Gruyere cheese (usually has cheddar), with a ton of hash browns to boot. But the thing that sold me the most was the biscuits...damn those were some good biscuits. They were perfection. Flaky, but not too flaky, slathered with just the right amount of butter and with their spiced apricot jam.....yuuummm. I ended up just taking the biscuit home in a box because I wanted to believe it was real. ( http://frenchsoulfood.co…) The burger was gigantic and also pretty freakin delicious. They top them caramelized onions and a special sauce. It probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. (http://frenchsoulfood.co…) Top everything off with impeccable and friendly service and Brenda's just became my new lunch spot. Next up is the gumbo and chicken :)

Seafoodies, YOU ARE BRENDA'S TARGET AUDIENCE. However, if you're not one for catfish beignets at 10:30 am (yum), their chocolate beignets are irresistible, oozing with hot, rich chocolate. You also can't go wrong with their specials (try to catch the sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce)! And their creamy biscuit and cheese infused grits make absolutely delicious compliments to any of their hearty dishes. The lines are way out of hand on weekends though. Also, the flowery moulding on the ceiling, rustic brick and cement walls, and natural lighting further tip the restaurant over the edge of hipness.

This place was AMAZING. (btw, this place has gotten a revamp since a year ago; it's sizable and not so much a hole in the wall anymore) I came barely hungry, but that didn't stop me from gobbling up everything in my way. A couple girl friends and I ordered the crawfish beignets. It was probably a bad idea to EACH get one, because we realized half way through that at our rate, we wouldn't be able to have a bite of our entrees. The watermelon iced tea was unbelievable. I had the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. Absolutely delicious. A tad sweet and savory. We wanted the dessert beignet flight, but there was no way we were going to make a dent, so we went with the plain and chocolate. They did not disappoint. Nothing here disappointed. DEFINITELY coming here agin

We came on a drizzly Veterans Day morning. Thinking that because it was a weekday, we could possibly get lucky and not have to wait for very long. Tough cookies on that one. We still had to wait an hour and a half. Super tempted to grab a taco from next door at taco bell, but we decided it would be best not to sour our palates before our meal. We ordered the crawfish beignets, fried chicken, grits, and the beef and gravy. HOLY COW. I have never had grits so flavorful and delicious in my entire life! The grits paired with the gravy- HEAVEN! The beef was a bit tough, but it was worth the chewing to get all of that flavor out. The chicken was good- but I would highly recommend sticking to the dark meat, as the breast was kind of dry (not overly dry- but it's as dry as breast meat usually is). There are no words for the crawfish beignets. The spicy powder coating is intriguing and prepares your mouth for the epic delight that you will soon encounter. The dough is fluffy and hot and stands up to the flavor that bursts out with that first bite. Big chunks of crawfish and sauce greet you as you sink your teeth in. DELICIOUS!!! Service that day was wonderful-- except for our waitress. She seemed to have a bug up her bum that refused to budge. Thankfully, the other servers picked up her slack, kept my coffee mug filled, and made sure we were okay. Totally made up for her poopy attitude that day.

I went to Brenda's for Brunch and I was extremely happy I did. We started out on a mission to Mama's but seeing the 50 person line. My group looked up and found Brenda's on Yelp.The wait time was only like 5 minutes. The place is small but well decorated with understated Cajun touches like the cafe Du Mounde cans and the lobsters distressed painting. I had the Gumbo and Beignets. The gumbo was really solid but I wish it had some seafood in it. The sausage in the seafood was really tasty. The Beignets were denser then the ones from New Orleans but had just as much powdered sugar. The chocolate was really good but I didn't like the apple filling for some reason. The basic was also good. My wife said that the eggs Benedict was one of the best she has ever had. She thought that the biscuits instead of English muffin really made the dish. Overall this place was great and we'll be back.

Followed the popularity and high yelp reviews to have dinner here during a weekend in San Fran. The place it self is very come as you are. Simple menu and a restaurant that sits about 35. No wait for a table on a Saturday night, but it was pretty full. We had the hushpuppies for an appetizer---very good...Fluffy and not greasy at all. Dinners were the étouffée and pork chop. I felt like they were both bland with very little flavor. Very disappointing. Tried the beignets for dessert and they were fresh but a little overcooked. Not a place I'd go to again...

Speak to me, shrimp po' boy.   What's that?  You want to get in my belly?   I think we're going to get along just fine. Chipotle remoulade rocked my po' boy.  So delicious. Careful if you're sitting in the tiny walking space between tables.  Be prepared to be bumped, frequently.  Service is brisk, because they're moving a big crowd in and out, and making sure they're well-fed. My, my, your grits are buttery and yummy.  Yes, I know that's redundant. Brenda's hardly needs another rave review.  Sorry folks, you just got one.

Seems like everyone was here this past Sunday, as were we. In fact, as my giant belly and I staggered home, we ran into a colleague at the MacArthur BART who was headed into the city for brunch at Brenda's! I concur with most of the raves: Whimsical, twisted marriage of Cajun/Creole and brunch cuisine; Brilliant beignet flight; Surprisingly airy space with distressed walls; Heavenly cheesy grits with a bite. (Be sure to supersize when offered the opportunity to add a side of fluffy, buttery biscuit!) The only disappointment was the pork belly special, which was tough and way overcooked (since the craze started, I average 4 pork bellies a month and so know of what I speak - if I keep it up, I suspect this is what they'll write on my headstone). I will concede, however, that the skin was smoky, perfectly rendered and crisp. Now put it all together... From my vantage point, there appeared to be a surprising paucity of catfish on the Catfish Po'boy, though the Catfish Benedict was well-endowed. Go figure. So glad we got there at 10AM; by the time we rolled out (literally), the sidewalk was teeming with folks waiting, and the staff was clearly stressed out.

Casual Thursday dinner: I order a serving of the oyster Tchoupitoulas. I also order a crawfish beignet to satisfy my Brenda's craving. My friend orders the same. Our oysters Tchoupitoulas arrive on a bed of rock salt, with lemon wedges on the side. They look, smell and taste like a baked mussel, but ten times better in terms of the satisfaction level. Smooth buttery flavor and a garlic crust work together to give the oyster texture and flavor. Mouth explosion? Totally worth the $2.50 price. I order a plate of the sweet potato dumplings with extra shrimp and crawfish. Filling, and absolutely fantastic. I love the maque choux for spinning some balance into the dish. Especially when you're just starting to bore of the cream sauce, which is impossible in my opinion. Waiting for your meal will require a bit of patience, but the effort is worth it. Nothing less (and nothing more) than a simple, delicious meal.

It's pretty heavy, so if you're on a diet stay awayyy. I wasn't very hungry when i went, so I just got the plain beignets and coffee, and my brother ( a regular) got the brisket with cheese grits and a biscuit. Beignets are perfect here, though I don't recommend getting the coffee. And the Brisket with grits had great, full flavor but it sits pretty heavy in your stomach. Its very small, with limited seating, and limited parking in the area, but I really think its worth the wait. I will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu.

Oh Brenda... I've been eying you for a while and we finally meet! When everything else is closed or super slow on New Years day, Brenda's has a one hour wait! A wait that was well worth it. - Friendly service overall. We were a bit disappointed at first since our table of 6 was seated at a table for 4. They had 2 tops sitting at tables for 4. A little unorganized but I guess that's normal with how busy the place was. We were later moved to a larger table. - Catfish Eggs Benedict was delicious. Hollandaise sauce was perfect. The biscuit was sooooooo soft! Would be better if they gave more fried catfish. Seasoned potatoes were good. - Flight Beignet was OK. I didn't enjoy the sweet ones (chocolate tasted like Nutella and apple was like an apple pie) too much. If you have a sweet tooth then you'll probably enjoy it more. The crawfish one was the best! I'd just stick with an order of that instead. - Watermelon Iced Tea was different but refreshing. Not too sweet. - Creole Bloody Mary. Nothing special. Skip it. FYI - Don't come here in groups larger than 4. Just makes it that much harder to get a table since the place is small.

+1 for the uniqueness of the food, friendly service I came here a while ago and only remember eating the Crawfish Beignet. I came here during the breakfast menu and remember the crawfish beignet being crispy and hot, freshly made from the kitchen. the smell of the baked seafood aroma rose from the plate after splitting the beignet in half. I recall that this beignet was worth the 20 min + wait we waited for, in addition to the parking meter we had to pay. I will definitely look foward on going to try the dinner menu! Looks DELICIOUS!

Stopped here before a show at the Regency last wednesday evening.  Seemed like the perfect time to go...we were seated right away.  Ordered the sweet watermelon tea...excellent choice! It had the perfect balance of black tea, watermelon, and sweetness....yum! My friend and i shared the BFC plate which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken goodness, collard greens, biscuit, and some of their hot pepper jelly. It was all just oh so yummy!! We were in kind of a rush so we didnt get to try the Chocolate Chip Bread pudding which looked AMAZING! oh well...maybe next time.

I stopped by here to grab breakfast with a friend. I was anticipating a long wait as usual but they finished renovating the place so there's a lot more space! It was still packed and really busy, but the wait wasn't as long. By 11, more crowds started forming outside. The wait really depends on how early you get there! Since Brenda's is always busy, service is always rushing around. The staff was good about checking up on us, but they made us feel rushed ourselves. They wanted our order STAT. We got the watermelon iced tea, beignet flight to share, and the hangtown fry and shrimp po'boy sandwich respectively. Watermelon iced tea is always amazing. Always recommended. Beignet flight is always recommended as well. I decided to order this to share because 4 beignets is a lot and my friend never had them before. Our favorites were the plain beignet and the crawfish one. We got full from this and we SHARED so keep that in mind. The hangtown fry was good. They put a good amount of whole oysters in there. I didn't really like the scallions because the texture was chewier, but I still liked the few bites I took. My friend seemed to like her sandwich too. Great place to go, but expect to leave immensely full.

I've been here twice in the past month for good reason...the food is incredible!  You must bring your appetite and expect to do very little after your meal, because you'll be too full to move. The things I would recommend are the crawfish beignets, homemade biscuits, BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken), and a Ghiradelli chocolate filled beignet.  Those items are excellent and well worth multiple visits. Some items I thought were only so so are the watermelon ice tea, gumbo and the beef dish they serve at brunch.  Those would be Meh, I've experienced better items.

Warning: Patrons may be lured by all the delicious breakfast/brunch option on the menu. In turn, this may result in over-eating and generally glutinous ramifications. Particularly dangerous items include the flight of beignets, Creole Veggie Omelette and the Egg & Bacon Tartine. Additional Warning: This place is small and they don't take reservations, so there may be a bit of a wait.

I felt like I was in New Orleans.  The decor (and the size of the restaurant) is french, and the food is Southern.  The house white is inexpensive and drinkable.  The crawfish beignet is utterly inauthentic and yet delicious.  The fried chicken is at least as good as the Front Porch's, and the sides are better.  The servers are cute, the service is cheerful, and the prices are right.   It's been a long time since I've been this happy during my first visit to a new restaurant.

Okay...I lived in or around New Orleans for 8 years and I was VERY reluctant and skeptical about this place. However, I had a meeting with a friend in the tenderloin and decided, "Hey! Ya gotta eat, right?" and tried Brenda's. I was hit by nostalgia right from my entrance with the Community and Cafe du Monde tins decorating the space and the "New Orleans Water Meter" clock on the wall. The menu is just chock full of goodies including Abita beer and I wanted one of everything but I went with the shrimp and grits, one oyster (the "Orleans") and a cream biscuit. GOOD LOOOOOORD!!!!!! Mama, I'm comin' home! This dish was GOOD and I've never had a better biscuit in my life. Of course, I must return and try other things and rate them, but...for a first experience...this is a 5.

I downloaded the "100 foods you have to try in SF before you die" list and I found Brenda's French Soul Food on there so my friend and I made plans to grab dinner here before watching a show on a Thursday night.   We ordered (1) beignets (2) shrimp & grits (3) shrimp po' boy.   Crawfish Beignets:  I've never had a beignet before so I have no frame of reference but its sort of bland tasting.  Is that how its supposed to taste?  I honestly don't know. Shrimp & Grits:  HIGHLY recommend.  It was perfect for a rainy day.  It's warm, got a nice little spice and bits of bacon. Shrimp Po' Boy:  le sigh.. the effects of hype.  It was honestly disappointing and I probably wouldn't get it again.  But I'm glad I tried it!

At the end of my meal Al Green was on the sound system. I rest my case. If you must know the details ("I must! I must!", you say), the line here can be pretty long, so after a long nite of partying, consider the wait penance for being a bad boy (or girl)... Once you're in, mimosas if you want to keep the party going or a really refreshing watermelon lemonade to start your rehab is on tap. The food is really good - trust me, I'm a doctor (actually no, I can't back that up, but I was born and raised in Cajun country). The Gumbo rocks. It is a must. If you have any room left after that the grillades and grits will finish you off nicely.

There's a reason why Soul Food is so often equated to exceptional comfort food! Brenda's offers foodies like me (and probably you) a hearty and delicious meal! The restaurant is small, and thus, on the more cozy side of things, which actually made it fun since my friends and I ended up socializing and chatting with neighboring guests about the food(s) they were eating. The place has a ton of cool mirrors and lots of natural lighting, which adds up to a clean and sleek ambiance in my opinion. As for the wait time, my friends and I came for brunch on a Saturday - the wait was around 40 minutes (at the minimum), which kinda sucked honestly and since there isn't much to do around the area, we ended up just chillin' in the car and exploring a bit of Little Saigon. FOOD TIME. When we finally were seated after waiting (which is my only major turn-off for this place), we ordered the crawfish beignets after hearing so much hype about it (and because my friend insisted we order them). They were awesome! Seriously, the spices and cajun kick mixed in with bits of crawfish and cheeses here and there made these snacks a savory treat right before the main courses made their way to the table. I ordered the sweet watermelon house tea, which surprisingly wasn't as sweet as they call it! Honestly, this was a good thing since the watermelon juice made this a refreshing and cool treat that goes well with the spiciness of this cuisine. Free refills too - always a plus! My main course was the Croque Monsieur, which was delicious and full of greasy goodness. I also tried a bit of my friend's Hangtown Fry, which was fantastic. If you're into that distinct seafood flavor, this is the scramble for you. All in all, a worthwhile experience! Despite the long wait, the food is great, and, with great company, you'll enjoy this place as much as I did.

Originally from Texas and I've been deprived of good southern comfort food for years. Brenda's is absolutely awesome. The service is friendly and the prices are incredibly for the quality of food that you get. I'm so happy that they've finally expanded to their next door area so the wait isn't too bad. Waiting here for brunch is a bit insane because you can end up waiting for 1.5 hours+, but coming here for dinner on a weekday night is perfect. They've got a cute little chalkboard to write our name on the wait list, and with the larger space it moves pretty quickly. Highly recommend the specials, whatever they may be. And start with the watermelon iced tea as a good refresher.

Freaking Brenda, Man. She does it AGAIN. How can you improve on her flawless breakfast wonders? Her illuminating lunches with a side of fries? You add dinner, of course. Hushpuppies- light puffs housing peppers and fresh corn. Note the usage of the word light here. That is key. Not dense, not heavy, not mealy. Light. Fried chicken. If placed atop your salad of choice, it is a breast brined and battered in the same concoction of cornmeal and secret spices as the catfish and shrimp po' boy. But on your chicken. Crunchy. Grande. BFC chicken has traditional batter, served with signature fluffy biscuit of golden perfection and collards. Speaking of segways; the collards. Done total Southern style, bacon and ever' thang. Good. Candied yams. Soft chunks of gingered syrupy sunset orange delectables. Scrumptious. My one beef. and this is minor, the house salad with creole dressing - something in there's super salty. But, I cleaned the plate - so it won't be stopping you and the goat cheese crostini's good for a crunchy palette cleanse. Show Stopper; Chocolate Chunk Cherry Bread Pudding. Hate a spongy, weighty bread pudding? Then have no fear. This is a melty wonder with smatterings of chocolate here, whole cherries there and all covered in a healthy serving of bourbon sauce and powdered sugar. A dollop of fresh whipped cream and this huge hunk of pudding will put a smile on your face, guaranteed even more iron clad than The Men's Warehouse. Service is impeccable, new space is bright - tight, yes, but not uncomfortable to dine on this Food of the Gods.

It's quite a walk from Bart. If driving and you're lucky enough to find street parking, hope you have lotsa quarters- it's $3 an hour. Once you're in get your name on that chalkboard asap. While you wait, study that menu... It's definitely worth the trip! Beignet Flight - The main reason I was here, and I was a bit disappointed. The plain and chocolate were good, nice and sweet. The apple a bit bland. The craw fish completely smothered with spices that aren't necessary, the craw fish nice and meaty, but eaten with the beignet it just didn't do it for me. The beignet dough itself was a little dry and tougher than I'm used to so that might be why I wasn't too into it... Shrimp & Grits - OMG, I don't think I can ever have grits again if it's not from Brenda's! Shrimp and bits of bacon top off creamy and cheesy grits. What completes it is the sauce... a little tangy, a little spicy and with the saltiness from the bacon- I'm in heaven! Shrimp Po Boy - Ain't nothin Po about this sandwich! It's completely rich with flavor. Shrimp fried in a cornmeal batter and lightly seasoned on a toasted roll. The remoulade had a nice kick to it. I almost, almost asked for more remoulade for dipping! Watermelon Iced Tea - As I type this review, my mouth is watering, so who needs Iced Tea? It's tasty and refreshing but the watermelon flavor is a hit or miss... Bottom line is I'll keep coming back for more!

For refined yet authentic French soul food, this place is the best. We stumbled upon Brenda's after a long day in the city, and tried the oysters,  beignets, the grits and the shrimp po'boy. They were all absolutely amazing. The food was not too fatty, not too greasy, but it was still very "southern." The vibe was pretty simple, a little quirky (very much like a place you'd stumble upon in a weird part of the city) but if good food trumps "fancy," then this is the place for you.

I hate craving something I absolutely can't have, especially if it's not within driving distance. Today's case: Brenda's crawfish beignets. Hands down the best beignet I've had. EVER. I've heard them compared to Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, except better -- I can't personally attest to that though, being I've never been there, but my boyfriend will. However, the chef-owner is from New Orleans herself, so... The beignet flight is a good idea if you're trying to get a taste of everything (plain, granny smith apple, chocolate and crawfish), which is what I had. But from here on out whenever I'm in SF I'm gonna cop a boxful of the crawfish beignets. What's a crawfish beignet you ask? A beignet minus the powdered sugar and in place is cayenne. The inside's crawfish, a [heavenly] cheese sauce, and scallions. Oh, and don't forget to order the Watermelon Sweet Tea, too. Far distances are unfortunate; we should be past the Jetsons generation and skip to teleportation already. Until next time, San Francisco...

I just may have to update my last meal on earth to Brenda's crawfish beignets. Yup. I definitely need to do that. I'd only been for breakfast & last week, a couple of my most favorite dinner partners in the world were able to meet for a special Brenda's dinner treat. The meal was nothing short of memorable. The salad topped with chicken & brie en croute was extremely tasty, but in either the dressing or an accidental spill of the salt shaker, the salt overwhelmed what should have been the best salad in the world. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, I am just not a fan of overly salty. The crawfish beignets came first though & that helped set the tone. Also sampled were the hushpuppies & they were the best I've ever had with their real corn & green onion complimented centers. I swear some of the hushpuppies even resembled puppies! Yes, I had wine, but not too much to cause the beer bottle glasses effect.  I love puppies. I also love me some collards & Brenda does everything right. They were better than my own & I make some mean collards. Chocolate & cherries are a match made in heaven & mixed in to a dessert of bread pudding is the stuff dreams are made of. I seriously slept on this meal as I felt like I had a bowling ball in my stomach all night long. This is no fault of Brenda's, however. I just had to have my fill of dim sum for a mid-afternoon lunch & gorged myself again at an early dinner. You're going to want refills of that watermelon ice tea & with the great alcohol selections, you probably can't leave without a quick pee. So, why oh why couldn't there have been more space planned in the aisle to the bathrooms? The remodel is very tasteful & it's nice to no longer have to walk through the kitchen to use the restroom, but seriously. I am smaller than average & I had to sideways shimmy between the tables. Bigger than tiny wannabe Brenda's staff need not apply. Minus one star, but I'm still in love with Brenda's.

They're now open for lunch and dinner, and who'd a thunk it - they have a kick ass vegan option right on their everyday menu! It's not hidden from view, no need to whisper into your server's ear inquiring about an option for plant based eaters for fear of being ridiculed by those sitting around you, and no winks, gun barrel hand motions, or secret handshakes - the Vegan Josephine is a legitimate lunch and dinner choice with Brenda's new and expanded hours. Score! With all that enthusiasm, you're probably wondering how it was, huh? Well, let me tell you: it was bomb! It's basically a tofu Sloppy Joe on a toasted potato roll with your choice of french fries or slaw (not vegan) on the side. I actually asked about having mixed greens instead of either of those options, and I got docked an additional $1 which I thought was a bit whack... but I suppose it doesn't completely overshadow my excitement over that fantastic sandwich option!

We've been here for brunch and dinners and like the food. This review is on the service that night from that one waitress. 2 of us showed up for dinner on Thursday night. Got there before 9 pm and got a rather unwelcoming look from the waitress while we waited to be seated. We were told to sit in the small tables in the cramped portion of the restaurant. She refused our request for a table on the half filled side of the restaurant that had more space. I suppose she beleived that the convenience of the Restaurant superceeds its paying patrons..... We left and went somewhere that actually welcomed us.

I came here a few weeks ago with a few long time friends. First off I love how the place atmosphere of the restaurant. It's best for small intimate dinners rather than large parties since it is quite small (two rows of tables). I really love huge chalkboard doors where you write your name for the waiting list. Anyway, on to the food. We order a variety of foods, including the crawfish beignets, BFC, catfish, BBQ pork ribs, and cornmeal fried shrimp po'boy. Most of these items tasted relatively average. The BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) was not what we expected. It doesn't taste like regular friend chicken, but I'm not sure that I like that either. The catfish was also average. The cornmeal fried shrimp po'boy was pretty yummy. The BEST thing we ordered was the BBQ PORK RIBS with collard greens. The meat was tender and the collard greens reminded me of my mom hahah Basically, I would only recommend the pork ribs and po'boy. However, if you come, you must must MUST order the bottomless WATERMELON ICED TEA. It's so refreshing!!! Oh, people on yelp praise the biscuit... It's alright. There's nothing particularly special to it except that it's pretty big. ENJOY

UHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! YUM!!!! I can't wait to come here again. I think I waited like an hour around 1 PM on Friday but it was totally worth it even though my tummy was grumbling =( Neighborhood is kinda jankalicious but nothing unbearable. It's pretty close to the bus stop. I can't say for parking, but my friend parked here once and had to keep feeding the meter since it was such a long wait. ANYWAY. The inside is so cute and I liked how they put their condiments on the table and the setting. Seating is a bit crowded but it's a very homey environment where everyone is talking. The watermelon tea was refreshing and goooooooood. FRIED OYSTER SAMMICH - I am definitely coming back for me Beignets.. were ok. They were quite doughy, I would have preferred it been lighter. The crawfish one I wish would have more crawfish. The apple & chocolate one was good. JAMBALAYA WAS THE BEST JAMBALAYA EVER. So flavorful!! I think that's about it. I am definitely coming again and I want to try their brunch!

Sweet sassy molassy, this soul food is good! With my hometown being tragically devoid of Creole restaurants (what's the deal with THAT, Vancouver?) I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem only a block away from my hotel. The Huzz and I visited on a Friday night around 7:30 to find a decent crowd of people waiting for a table. Luckily, we managed to squeeze into a spot in the waiting area which enabled us to enjoy a beer while waiting for a table to open up. We were seated about a half hour later, and upon perusing the delicious-looking menu, I decided to indulge in a catfish po'boy. Now, I've never had catfish before and I didn't really know what to expect, but man was it ever good! It was served with a flavourful chipotle sauce, and, being the sucker for chipotle that I am, I was in heaven. All things said and done, the bill for the two of us including two drinks each came to a very reasonable $40ish bucks. Not too shabby if I say so myself. Although I didn't try their brunch, the menu looks amazing. Based on the mosh-pit of people I saw waiting outside Brenda's on Saturday and Sunday mornings, their brunch probably tastes amazing too.

O MY HOLAY YUM!!!!!!!!!!!soooo freaking good!!!!!!! Ya I'm not even going to bother adding much details.  Basically anything you choose to eat will probably be delicious.   The wait is ridiculous though, but so worth it! Here's my recommendations for MUST-TRYS: -watermelon ice tea!  (fair warning...if you intend to pay the 50 cents for the take away cup...they do not refill your cup!) -crawfish beignets!  TO DIE FOR! -sloppy joe...ahhh brings me back to those childhood takes with that mary-kate and ashley olsen movie It Takes Two. -Shrimp and Grits!  (this is BIG coming from me since I'm not a shrimp lover) Done.  This is on my fav sf restaurant list.

I was lucky to find this place... I was actually looking for a breakfast plae on yelp in the morning and saw Brenda. I did not look like a place for me to just get some coffee and breakfast. But nevertheless the food and reviews looked interesting. So in the evening, hungry and looking for a place to eat, I remembered the name and walked pass by. No regrets at all having stopped here :-) First of all it's very nice looking place, high ceilings, a mix between raw materials and perfectly finished surfaces, natural light via roof openings, and a friendly service :-) I ordered their BFC, fried chicken pieces with a fantastic sauce. Excellent! The rest looked delicious too, but I skipped as I only have one stomach. But clearly a place on the list of "to go again"

Most delicious brunch meal I have ever had in my entire life. The wait can get long, but worth every second. I came with my boyfriend on a drizzly, SF Sunday morning before work and luckily due to the rain did not have to wait too long for a table. We ordered the chicken, sausage, okra gumbo which was hearty and rich. I have never been a big okra fan, but this dish definitely sold me on it. Secondly we had the croque monsieur. The sourdough bread and ham are full or flavor and high quality. The gruyere melted over the ham is an awesome compliment, not too overpowering. The entire dish was delicious. Lastly, we had the the crawfish beignets. They are the most delicious bundles of seafood goodness I have ever had, I am not even exaggerating. The beignets themselves are crispy on the outside and deliciously gooey on the inside. The filling is packed with huge chunks of crawfish and a slightly spicy, cajun-style sauce. I loved that you could really taste the richness of the crawfish. I dream of this dish and think everyone needs to try it. Overall, I will be back many times, especially for the crawfish beignets. I enjoyed seeing Brenda in the back cooking up a storm, it really shows her dedication to the restaurant. The service is laid back, yet attentive to your needs. The coffee is good, the mimosas are good, and the food is heaven on a plate. This place lives up to the hype.

Took my parents here for their 33rd wedding anniversary brunch. I'm gonna have to deduct a star from my previous 5 star rating because the waitress we got this time around was kinda sarcastic to my dad. My dad has a thick Filipino accent and when he asked for his coffee I think it took her off guard and she regarded it as him being rude, which he was not being. Later on when he asked for a refill she replied back pretty sarcastically as if my dad was hounding her. I didn't really appreciate that. My dad was probably the only "average joe" there amidst a sea of young hipsters. Maybe that caught her off guard? Also, when she did pour the coffee some of it spilled onto the table. This time I tried the Shrimp Po Boy which was dIvine. I had my leftovers for dinner later on in the day and it was good even cold. The french fries it came with though, not so much. All our food came out at the same time but I think my french fries were cooked ahead of everything else. They didn't come out hot and fried but rather warm.

I never thought I would get a table within minutes at noon - so happy the additional seating is helping make this a more accessible restaurant!! As everyone raves, the food is divine. The staff may be a bit on the prickly side at times, but they are prompt and efficient, so I always let it slide. Anyone who has worked in a service industry job knows how exhausting it is to fake nice all the time. Watermelon Ice Tea 4 life!!

The beignets were not that great. Too chewy and the filling is just ok. Didn't blow my mind. We also had some grits and they put way too much cheese. So much that I couldn't taste the grits. It was just one big mess. Nothing turns me off like unbalanced flavors in food. Service was fine. Place is small so it fills up quick.

This place makes my Top 5 San Francisco restaurants list. Amazing food, literally every bite was filled with delight and I left saying "best meal ever". The baked oysters are crazy good, if you like oysters these are finger licking good. Mac & cheese was everything I want in mac & cheese. Melty, cheesy, delicious and in the perfect, "not so big i feel like a fatty" bowl. Finally my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits which was really good and i got the Salad with brie & catfish.... OMG I was blissin' and still feel the food happiness today. I'd been eyeing Brenda's on yelp for months, dying to try everything. My expectations were greatly surpassed. To put a cherry on top, the staff is so friendly. You have got to try Brenda's!

Today was my lucky day.  Looking at all the stellar reviews about this place, I dragged my husband to this place for my post-birthday lunch.  Knowing that this place is on the borders of the tenderloin, I was hesistant about going.  But today, it was just our lucky day.  We chugged some coins in the meter, scoped out the waiting list, and wrote our names on the board.  Within fifteen minutes, we were seated (given this was around 1:30pm and we were in competition with a 14 person party)! Upon sitting, we could not figure out what to order...breakfast or lunch?  We settled with the Mufflata and the Oyster Poboy.  And then, we added the  beignet flight: 4 different flavored beignets to taste: plain, apple, chocolate, and crawfish.  The beignets were a delight as what my husband would say...ESPECIALLY the Crawfish.  Sadly we were stuffed by the beignets, that we were  only able to eat half of our main course.  Must I add, the Mufflata was perfect: warmed poppyseed/nut bread with melted garlic spread and stacks of salami and provolone sandwich.  It was like eating heaven!  The oyster po-boy was light surprisingly!  Did I forget to mention their watermelon iced tea was refreshing!  I need to get this recipe!  I love watermelon!  With everything we ordered, the prices are reasonable!  I'd definitely go back to Brenda's.

This place is definitely worth the 1.5 hour wait on a Sunday. You cant go wrong with the omelets and the crawfish beignet was amazing! If it is your first time, I recommend getting the beignet sampler as it gives you a taste of 4 different flavors. Here you will find very friendly and patient servers who endlessly fill up your cup with delicious watermelon ice tea, a MUST GET! (+ 100 brownie points) I recommend arriving early, putting your name down on the board and go for a walk around the block as you wait, to get your tummy ready for happiness!

I'm going to up my review to 5 stars for the fact that everything I've tried at Brenda's just makes my water mouth, my stomach happy, and is the type of food that makes me giggle as I eat it. Since my first trip, I went back to Brenda's again for the second time, this time getting to order and try more dishes than the last. Between a friend and I, we got Granny Smith Apple Beignets, Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette, and Biscuits w/Gravy. The Beignets here are divine - fluffy and so delicious. This time around, I tried an omelet with meat - very good dish, yet also very heavy. I also love their grits here - very simple but I just can't stop eating it. Lastly, my friend opted for a side of biscuits and gravy which I'm very glad we chose to get - the gravy here is SO good. And again, the Watermelon Tea is awesome. Overall, I'm giving Brenda's 5 stars. It's worth the wait, service is not necessarily super friendly but very attentive (if that makes any sense - basically you're not gunna get the friendliest since it get so busy, but never worry about not having things refilled or waiting too long for your food), and everything I order from here that enters my mouth is just to die for. YUMMMMMM, when can I have you again, Brenda?!

After hearing so much about Brenda's, I've intended to check it out for a while but the opportunity didn't present itself until today. Oddly, there were several parks right out front. There was a short wait, but since I was solo I was immediately seated. Just as I settled in I noticed the diner to my left only left a dollar tip. He seemed like a nice enough guy from our brief encounter, but I suppose nice guys can be tight wads too. Whatever the case the server quickly snatched up the bill, smiled and proceeded to provide me with top notch service. They have a pretty limited menu between three and five o'clock, but that didn't bother me nearly as much as the young man who decided to tidy and sweep near where I was eating.  From the few choices, I opted for the beans and rice. I received a very generous portion and the dish was nicely presented. It wasn't soupy and the beans weren't mushy which was to my liking but the beans lacked flavor. Since the beans were served with andouille sausage, I suppose the intent was to keep the beans subtle.  Unfortunately, the sausage was simply too salty for my taste. Overall, it was a decent experience.  I'll be sure to plan my next visit when more options are available.

I'm giving Brenda's 5 stars, because Grits is one of my favorite things in the world, and I've never had it better than when I had it here. A mound of ground corn, cooked, and simmered for hours with patience (and if done the right way - lots of love ;D ) in milk, butter, and a few other magical ingredients - grits. Unfortunately, if you've ever had that crunchy, watery, tasteless garbage that you get from a microwave, or a restaurant that makes it from one - then you've probably already been scared off, and won't understand these first few paragraphs. But - if you're lucky to have experienced it done correctly, then you'll know that not every restaurant that serves breakfast does justice to a real bowl of grits; and that finding one that doesn't lazily tip toe around the crucial steps - is a rarity. Tasting a bowl of grits from a restaurant is like a first kiss. First impressions mean everything, and if it isn't done properly, it gets sloppy, disgusting, and then you're left wondering what the fuss was all about in the first place. However - when you find someone who knows what they're doing - it can be magical. The buttery, soft, and lusciously creamy grits at Brenda's in San Francisco, CA is the kiss that electrifies. Not the amateur garbage that you'll find at a chain that thinks microwaving water and packaged corn meal will do the trick. And before I move on - I'll add this. As soon as this dish finally made its' way to my table, I kid you not - I heard 'Etta James - At Last' play in the background, and I have to say - the first few words of this particular song couldn't have sang the description of that moment more perfectly, and it was like absolute music to my mouth. It was pretty easy to choose Brenda's French Soul Food for Brunch as I was surfing through yelp one morning. They are famous for some of their dishes such as the Chicken, Sausage & Okra Gumbo, their Cinnamon Battered Brioche French Toast, and of course, what hooked me in the first place - their Stuffed Beignet Flight. If you've ever enjoyed a delicious fried Ozzie Roll from any of the Great American Restaurants such as Sweet Water, or Mike's American - imagine it doubled in size, and stuffed with crawfish, scallions and cheddar. Then imagine another few mini fried donuts, one stuffed with molten Ghiradelli chocolate, one stuffed with apples, cinnamon and honey butter - and you've got the Beignet Flight. I'm always wary of eating fried seafood, just because I'd rather be eating the meat itself than the clumps of batter that it's often hidden beneath. But here, the shrimp in this Battered Shrimp Po-Boy is lightly battered and served on a bed of fresh, chopped lettuce, sliced tomato, drizzled lightly with remoulade, and stacked together between a thinner slice of toasted bread to make sure that not only is your first bite light, and fresh - but that the shrimp is at absolute center stage. The Hangtown Fry gathers together a few of my most favorite things - oysters, eggs, and bacon. What I appreciate most about this dish is the lightness and fluffiness in the eggs, even though it's fried together with two other components that could easily make this a greasy mess. Instead, Brenda's pairs this perfectly cooked combination with an even fluffier cream biscuit, and of course - a bowl of delicious, perfectly cooked grits that I could have honestly just eaten by itself for the rest of the day. As soon as you taste a spoonful, you'll know what I mean; as you can easily tell that the grits were boiled and simmered for a long, long time to get those bits of corn soft, and creamy enough. Ultimately - Brenda's French Soul Food is a Creole Kitchen that brings flavors from New Orleans that are deliciously rich, yet resoundingly light. Enjoy their daily specials for Brunch from 8AM to 3PM, and if you're from out of town - enjoy the Civic Center's Parks and Museums right down the street afterwards. Bon Appétit!

I visit Brenda's EVERY time I visit San Francisco.  I love this place so much that last visit I actually went twice.  I do try to get something new each time but can't help but stuff my face with the crawfish beignets. Delicate and sweet crawfish cascading down a cheddar and scallion waterfall from a crispy, hot, airy donut? Count me in! I love the spices that are liberally dusted over the top.  It looks like it may be too much, but it adds that much needed heat and flavor to blunt the richness of the filling.  I've had all the other beignets also, which are equally delicious, but I'll take salt over sugar just about any day. I had the Oyster and bacon scramble, it's delicious. The salt from the large bits of bacon are a needed addition to the rich eggs and oysters.   Shrimp and Grits? To die for, savory, spicy, rich, creamy grits with tender shrimp.   Lastly, the french toast with pecan sauce is Lovely  The sauce is the key, and boy do they do it right. It's sweet, nutty, buttery, and so beyond any pecan syrup I have had.   I've had other items at Brenda's including the watermelon tea, some scrambles, and sides, but what I've listed are the items that make me want to jump on a plane and stuff my little piggy face, even if the wait is over an hour.  Time after time I find it well worth it.

I'm a HUGE fan of cajun/creole food and this is definitely on my list of the best restaurants to get cajun/creole food in the bay area. We got there knowing that the lines get pretty long. The wait was actually pretty long but my friends and I just played Hanging with Friends the whole time. They even served us drinks while we were waiting we got a couple glasses of mimosas to hold us over. When we finally sat down, I looked at the menu and I was drooling. My eyes got so big and I wanted to try everything! I ended up ordering the watermelon iced tea, the beignet flight, the cornmeal-fried shrimp po'boy and a side of BFC breast. I was completely full but holy crap, what a damn delicious meal. The crawfish beignet blew me away. I've never had a savory beignet, but now I just want them to always be savory. The shrimp on the po'boy was perfectly cooked and the sauce was to die for. The watermelon iced tea was good, although I wouldn't say it's necessarily something I need to get every time I come here. And the chicken was definitely above average. My friends got the hangtown fry and grillades & grits. I got to try a bite of both of them and they were both pretty good as well. Every time I try amazing cajun/creole food, it just gives me more reason to travel to New Orleans and this place is no exception.

Came to Brenda's for their catfish Po'Boy sandwich .. but didnt end up getting that dish after reading on Yelp that it was an overkill of catfish. I decided to get the Shrimp and Grits and my BF got the Croque Monsieur. I'm stupid. I SO didn't know what grits were. In my mind (for some strange reason), I had another image, so when the dish came I was disappointed (NOT knocking off any points for this, my fault). The grits dish had alot of cheese in it and it made me feel really bloated, but I think that's how its usually made. The Croque Monsieur dish my BF got was pretty good, very hearty and a decent portion. I kept eyeing his sandwich while eating mine, wishing I got the same thing. MUST MUST get the watermelon tea. Very refreshing and its supposed to be bottomless?? But our waiter completely failed to refill it even though we told him numerous times we wanted more. Didn't receive the greatest service.

Lists make everything easy. Let's begin: - Worth the wait. Put your name on the board, most people leave in the process of waiting. - Forget the beignet flight, because the crawfish beignets are what you what. Also, their beignets are doughy and very filling, so don't overdo it. - Biscuit over toast, because these biscuits are baked in a freaking oven in heaven and brought down by fat cherubs on a rainbow down towards Brenda's in the Tenderloin. Get in mah belleh! You are so effing delicious!! - Try the jam, it goes great on your carbs. - These grits will change yo lyfe! - Some waitresses can get a little snappy, probably because they have to serve an endless line of customers. Bear with it and tip accordingly :)

LOVE this place. One of the three best brunch spots in the city (along with Red Door & Dottie's of course!). Unique options and flavors. I spied the most beautiful beignets being served at the table next to us that I am definitely going to have to try next time... The only beef that I had with this place before is that the wait was so long, but they just expanded the place, so now that's not a problem. Score!

not gonna lie i couldn't stop thinking about the frog princess when my friends and i ordered the beignet flight! it comes with their beignets in chocolate, crawfish, apple and plain. apple was whatever, plain was only good with some preserves spread onto it, chocolate was mouthgasmic and the crawfish one was surprisingly delicious and flavorful! i got the pulled pork eggs benedict, which was one of their MANY specials of the day. everything on the plate from the potatoes to the biscuits that are used in lieu of english muffins was delicious and really well made. everything's bursting with flavor and you will definitely leave this place full and happy. p.s. speaking from experience, this place makes for great hangover food. it's worth the misery you feel while standing outside waiting for your party to be called

Food: Crawfish beignets - I'm not a crawfish fan but WOW! when you see the seasoning on top it intimidates you but don't be! Amazing! Ribs: so tender and juicy.

Decided to give Brend's a try based on a friend's recommendation. We waited for almost an hour on a Saturday afternoon, but it was worth it! - Beignets flight (4 beignets: plain, chocolate, apple, crawlfish) These things were huge! I could eat just one of them for lunch and be pretty satisfied. The crawlfish one is the best, followed by chocolate. My critique would be that the dough is a little thick and not as fluffy as I'd like, but probably it wouldn't be able to hold all those filling otherwise. - Hangtown fry This is scramble egg with fried oyster and bacon. Flavorful combination. Oysters are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Could use a bit more salt, but no complains. - Grit with pork belly and poached egg, and some kind of spicy salsa One of the special of the day. Indivually each component was well cooked, particular the pork belly (crispy skin, tender meat), but somehow the dish just didn't seem to fit together. All in all we were very satisfied with the meal. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes!

This is the kind of place that no matter what you order it's going to be delicious. My boyfriend and I have walked past it a few times but it was always so packed with a wait. We went for an early dinner, around 530, and was sat immediately. We had two entrees that we shared, the bbq pork ribs with collard greens and mac n cheese, and the special of that night, the craw fish and andouille pot pie. We finished up with the deep fried peach pie. The chef here must have lived down south or has spent several years studying the cajun/french cuisine. The flavor profiles of everything was spot on. We cant wait to go back and to bring our friends. This place is a must go

Let me be straight, if I could get away with awarding no stars to this place - I would have. It was simply that much of a disappointment. This was my first San Francisco brunch experience since I moved back a few months ago and I was stoked after realizing that their shtick is a brasserie like twist on classic dishes from the American South. Now, i was born and raised on a corn farm in rural Mississippi. I'm not a hater when it comes to this subject. If a place outside the South wants to serve southern style food, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt and happily gorge myself on it because it reminds me of home. It may not compare to Grandma's cooking or the hole-in-the-wall po-boy shop somewhere in New Orleans but I have found myself mightily surprised by some of the southern style dishes I have come across in places like New York and Las Vegas. So, naturally, I was beside myself. San Francisco is after all known for its food scene and I only became more ecstatic when I saw the giant line posted up outside this tiny Tenderloin cubby hole of a restaurant. I thought, "Wow. This place must be really good!" For an hour and a half, my husband and I stood near the specials board outside and drooled over the promise of Cajun Bloody Marys, fried green tomato eggs benedict and catfish po-boys. When we were finally seated, we were both drooling with anticipation and the service was luckily pretty quick however our food came out at different times. Now to the bottom line - the food. My Cajun Bloody Mary might have been my favorite part of the meal and that's because it had a perfectly pickled okra right on top - mmm! The glass rimmed with Cajun spice promised a good and spicy Bloody Mary to follow. The truth of the matter is that the drink was too damn watery. My suggestion is to order a bottled beer such as the Raspberry Abita my husband ordered. The catfish po-boy wasn't too bad except that po-boys are generally served on a New Orleans style french bread that is almost like a baguette. You need a good sturdy bread to hold up under the massive amount of dripping, spicy deliciousness inside it. Brenda's po-boy was served on focaccia bread which essentially turned to mush before the sandwich had been fully eaten. The fries were fine. The grits were fine. The fried green tomato eggs benedict was the hard knock of reality to my already waning elation. The eggs were poached well enough, but the biscuits they sat atop were so dry and chalky that I couldn't eat them. Using a damn Pillsbury can would have worked better for them. The "creole hollandaise" was absolutely inedible. There were pieces of stone ground mustard in it from the looks of it but it honestly tasted like vomit. The fried green tomato was soggy and impossible cut with a fork. I took two bites and then stomached down a third before I gave up trying to eat it altogether. I would find out later that lines aren't a good indicator of how good a brunch location is in San Francisco, but that it is simply the nature of a weekend brunch crowd in this town. My advice? Line up somewhere else.

Yes, I did a solo run this time            have to pack them to go!     It was ok cup of Gumbo     nice and spicy     pleasant chowder (no comment ... no expert on gumbo)     have okra Shrimps on Grits (Best of all 4 items)     It was delicious ... only had grits 4 times     However I had eaten soft polenta more than 100 times.     This was one of the better tasting soft polenta or grits that I had.     It seasoned very well     Had a layer of cheese on top (no oil floating like other people's                 comment)     A splash of some type of cajun or creole sauce above the cheese     On top ... 8 deliously seasoned shrimps and chunks of marinaded                tomates (my bet that it was S&W stewed tomatoes                                  I use them the tomato season are over.                                  Don't knock it the quality is better than                                  non local tomates that were picked unripened off                                  the vine.)      I would come back just for this dish Incomplete ... will add more in a few days

YUMMMY! + wait wasn't too long (20min?) - chocolate beignets: the chocolate wasn't melted + friendly service + good coffee + grillades & grits: the beef cutlets were amazing!!! and blended so well with the grits. my friend was really impressed with the biscuit -/+ pumpkin pancakes were good too, but a little too sweet I would go again!

We waited for almost 1 hour before getting seated.. was it really worth the wait? I am definitely a fan but I'm not sure if the food was good enough to say that it was worth an hour of waiting outside and multiple visits to the car meter. The place is really small but the food is great. My friends and I shared the Beignets flight... loved the crawfish beignet and the chocholate :) i got the fried chicken benedict. it was ok. my favorite was the shrimp grits. so cheesy and flavorful! as other people have said.. the croque monsieur was nothing special. i definitely loved that Philz coffee was a very short walking distance away from brenda's. Good way to kill time while we waited! :)

The day I ate at Brenda's French Soul Food was one of my belly's happiest moments. There was no line when my lunch date and I went! We were able to find parking quickly and get seated immediately. We were extremely lucky that day. I ordered the catfish eggs benedict and shared the beignet flight. So delicious. The catfish eggs benedict was so light but full of flavor and texture. The eggs were poached perfectly and the heavenly yolks added even more moisture to the already soft and buttery biscuit. The catfish was perfectly golden brown on the outside and mouthwatering on the inside. A stellar dish. Towards the end of my meal, I was getting full. So when it came to sharing the beignet flight, I took a small sample bite of all of them but had to make a choice. The crawfish and the chocolate. Winners. To drink, I had the watermelon black tea. Delicious? Yes. Bottomless? Yes. Obvious choice? Yes. Overall, the interior (high ceilings! mirrors! everything!) and food made this lunch date great for me, my friend, and my stomach.

French soul food moves to the Tenderloin and it's a smashing hit!  The wait is over an hour but it is worth it.  The restaurant is small so the spacing between tables is incommodious.  Prepare to get cozy with your neighbor because you are practically side by side with them.   Pass on the beignets.  It's not that great and there are other marvels at the restaurant that should fill your stomach.  The grillade and grits is phenomenal.  It's not perfect.  The grillade itself needs to be spicier.  It's soul food, right?  There was no kick to it but it tasted fantastic as soon as hot sauce was added to it.  The grits are to die for!  I can't even begin to describe it.  It's just the best grits I've ever had anywhere including New Orleans.  I could eat a plate full of it but it wasn't my dish and I did have a large plate of sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce in front of me.  The pancakes were fluffy and light.  The sauce is perfectly sweet and the nuts just round it off nicely.   This is a great brunch place.  My only complaint is the excessive wait time.  I wish they would expand to a larger restaurant.  Prepare to wait and have something to occupy your time.  It's the Tenderloin so there isn't much in the area.  Bring a book or play with your smartphone during the wait....or imagine how good the food will taste in about an hour!

Oh, Brenda...if I weren't already smitten by my awesome gf I would ask you to be mine. Although we have never met, your food is so delicious it must only come from someone equally sweet! :) I've been coming to eat my heart out at Brenda's French Soul Food restaurant since they occupied only half of the space that they currently do. Since then they have exploded onto the scene as, "A must visit brunch spot in SF". I've been here for both brunch (expect to wait if you don't get there when they open their doors) and dinner. The food and service has always been top notch. Here is a sampling of some of my favorite items: - Beignets (Granny Smith Apple and Ghirardelli Chocolate) - Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich - French Toast with Butter Pecan Sauce - Fried Chicken - Watermelon Sweet Tea Suggestion for Brenda: I love the chalk sign up board...have you ever thought of providing colored chalk to customers to create street chalk artwork while they wait for your yummy food? Just a thought... :)

I tried the beignet flight... and I have to say that the chocolate and regular were alright.  And I think it's because I prefer the ones at Jazz Kitchen in Downtown Disney or even the Mickey Mouse shaped ones over there in Disneyland.  It didn't feel as fluffy and needed more powdered sugar.   I just don't do fruit filled things so I didn't even bother attempting to eat the rest of the apple filled one.  I would take a McDonald's apple pie over that beignet.  My favorite happened to be the crawfish beignet.  I don't know why but it just was the best tasting one.  My suggestion: the crawfish one.

I've been to Brendas twice in the last 6 months and its easily become on of my favorite places to eat in SF.  The last time I was here, we came with a party of 8 on a Saturday and got seated promptly because we were here early...530 pm.  Another hour and we would have had a long wait!  Also, its located in a rough part of town, but that comes with the charm I suppose. We ordered quite a variety of dishes:  Flight of beignets, shrimp and grits, BFC, catfish po boy and BBQ pork ribs.  EVERYTHING was good! Crawfish beignets and BFC are stand out dishes.  The biscuits served here may be the best I've ever had. The restaurant is also very small and narrow, but I know they are expanding-perhaps they have done so by now.   Brendas will always be one of my faves.  :-)

I really struggled with the rating for this one. On the one hand, the food is legitimately excellent. On the other hand, the unbelievably long wait outside AND inside the restaurant coupled with what seemed to be random/out-of-order food service made it a trying experience when we first went. Have I had equally good (if not better) food before? Yes. At restaurants where we didn't have to wait almost 2 hours to eat despite showing up at 10am? Yes. But at the end of the day, I'm giving credit where credit is due. The food is really good (except the grillades - meat was dry) and it is clear that a lot of care and time went into every aspect of the menu. It is definitely worth a visit, but maybe at 8am just to avoid the lines.

I love this place. I wish the expansion build out would hurry up so the wait wouldn't be so ridiculous. Seriously don't attempt to go to this restaurant for weekend brunch between the hours of 10 and 1pm with a party larger than two or expect to wait for a pretty long time. We had six and I think we waited for an hour. Now back to the good stuff (in order of awesomeness): Watermelon sweet tea - I dream about this tea. In the week leading up to a visit here, I wake up tasting this tea. It is so watermelony and not too sweet. Sigh... I need to figure out how to make this at home so I don't wait for an hour just to feed my habit. Gumbo - awesome, tasty, they give you lots of good stuff and not just filler broth. I order a cup almost every time I eat here. Beignets - Not on my must have list, but definitely something I order on a regular basis. My favorites are the apple and the crawfish. I find the chocolate a tad too sweet. Eggs Benedict - I had the fried green tomato version on my most recent trip. It was delicious tasty, but I suggest sharing as the benedicts are built on their ridiculously flaky biscuits so they're very filling. I've also had the catfish version and that was also good.

I love breakfast and I think this was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  You must must must get the beignets. We got the beignets filled with chocolate and ate them with the strawberry jam on that was on the table.AMAZING!  We could have easily stopped there, but had already ordered entrees. I got the french toast and it was quite good.The atmosphere is very charming.  Definitely a highlight of our time in San Francisco!

The thing about Brenda's is I love it but I would not if I ordered any of their famous dishes. I've tried their po'boy, hangtown fry, the grillades, the tartine, and i could go on. Of all the hyped stuff the grillades are definitely the best but everything else is average. I'm always impressed with their basics though, they just know how to make good food. They've got great beignets and the biscuits are delicious. They made me love grits and they really should sell their jam as it's amazing. I've come out of here way happier just getting biscuits and gravy with a side of ham then with any of their specials or popular dishes. The service is efficient and coffee is always being filled. Coming here on the weekdays before 10 AM you never have to wait in line and on the weekends I think we've passed by around 9:30 with a short wait. Definitely worth the hype, but not in the way I expected.

Brenda's has a warm ambiance.  You walk in and write your name on the chalkboard with the number of people in your party.  They call you, and you sit at a table, decorated with a tin can full of condiments and a coffee can of utensils wrapped in paper napkins.  There are mirrors of different sizes and shapes mounted on the cracked concrete wall, a gold-tiled ceiling and black room dividers.  I couldn't get over how cool this place looked.  And, jazz music is constantly pumping through the speakers.  I've never been to New Orleans, but this place reaaaally makes me want to go. So, the food.  My friend and I split an order of the ghirardelli chocolate beignets.  Be warned, these come three to an order and they are very dense.  I've never had a true beignet before, so I'm not certain that is normal, but I would personally prefer a puffier lighter donut.  My friend had the shrimp and grits.  Huge portion and very cheesy.  Perfect to have something savory after all that sweetness of the beignets.  I had a dungeness crab beignet (one of the daily specials).  It was served with a mustard sauce, and the crab filling was spiced with Cajun spices and sauteed leeks.  The flavors were on point but the heaviness of a beignet following a beignet was not the best choice on my part.   We washed everything down with a glass of watermelon tea, which is perfectly sweetened, if at all.  There was about an inch of watermelon pulp gathered on the bottom of the glass, so, if you're not a pulp person, don't drink your straw from the bottom.

No wait at 8am on a Saturday, pre-wedding dress shopping with my friend.  I understand this is pretty unusual, so I'll just chalk it up to my own superpowers. Chocolate beignets: delicious, but way too much sweet stuff for me.  I was convinced that I had chocolate all over my face after eating just one.  Those suckers are messy. Crawfish beignets: now these made me wish that I had skipped the chocolate beignets entirely.  Hot, with melted cheese and chunks of crawfish oozing out, covered in a thick coating of either paprika or cayenne (memory fails) and studded with green onions.  The south has risen! The bacon was perfectly cooked, the coffee had a great flavor (and there was plenty of it), plus my friend tells me her biscuit and jam was top notch. We walked out of there completely stuffed, with a couple beignets and some leftover biscuit to spare. I'll be back to try lunch and dinner!

Came here on a Saturday at around 530pm and surprisingly, we were seated right away. I would HIGHLY recommend their crawfish beignet as an appetizer -- love the cheesyness in this fried crawfish bun. Their chicken, sausage & okra gumbo was amazing too -- usually, the gumbos ive had before are pretty packed w/ meat but this one was pretty light, which i liked. As for entrees, I would recommend the Shrimp & Grits but only to share it w/ someone because it's pretty damn cheesy (but who doesn't love cheese?!). Also, I normally don't like grits too but this one was good! The fried chicken w/ collard greens/biscuit was good too except I wish they gave us fatter pieces of chicken (ha! but i guess it wouldn't be as 'healthy') And to top off your meal w/ desserts, get the rice pudding brulee!

Came for dinner on a Friday night (7pm). Table for 3 seated immediately. LOVED my shrimp with grits. The shrimp sat on top of a bowl full of grits. Shrimp come in a little juice thats slightly sweet and adds excellent flavor to the grits when mixed in. Cheese (not too much) on top of the grits as well. My friend's rice and beans were so-so. The hot pepper jelly that comes with the BFC: delicious. Watermelon tea was refreshing too after a long day of sightseeing. Oyster Po'boy? So-so. I think I'll stick to the un-deep-fried oysters. Need to come back to try the Crawfish Beignets. They looked Amazing.

This is hands down the best New Orleans restaurant in San Francisco. Being from New Orleans, I've been craving almost everything on their menu. The red beans and rice are honestly better than most I've had back home. Her twist on the po boy with the extra sauce is phenomenal. Went for breakfast not too long ago and had the breakfast special of grits, fried pork belly, poached egg, cheese, etc. Expect to wait at least an hour, probably two on the weekends. The wait is 110% worth the food, and there is a cute bookstore a few blocks away on Van Ness to keep you entertained. They also have a selection of Abita beers, and usually stock and special edition beers that come out. Only downfall thus far, is that they don't serve red beans during brunch on the weekends, and that they aren't stocking Abita strawberry yet this year. Everyone should try this place!

This was actually our second choice after finding that Swan Oyster Depot was going under renovations (boooo-hisss!!).   The wait was about an hour, but I was okay with that because it gave me time to look over the menu and decide on what to get.  Please keep in mind that it was a Monday, and we figured that most people would be making money at work so we wouldn't have an issue with waiting.  We were wrong....but still, I was cool with the hour wait. Anyway I really wish I could say that the wait was worth it -- and I thought it was during the middle of my meal! -- but towards the end of eating, I was kinda disgusted.  I ordered the BFC (fried chicken and fries), and was enjoying my meal (the batter they use is delicioso!) until I found a hair in the middle of the fries!  And no, it wasn't the type that you would find on the top of your head, but a short, curly one that you would find on another part of your body (above the knees, below your belly button).  I told the hostess (who was really nice BTW), and she offered if I would like another plate, but I just totally lost my appetite.  As much as I wish I could offer more stars, I don't think I could recover from my experience.

I ordered stuff to go, but they weren't as great when you eat there.  I almost missed the door because they were renovating. Note for the owner: I like your new interior style. It's modern n crisp. I took 2 of my gfs that were visiting from LA. The line was long, so we ditched the line to go eat to Vietnamese resto around the corner. BIG MISTAKE! ='(. We then back again for the next day, had the greatest time and minimal wait. It was 2pm something on weekdays. A gf had a gumbo and fried chick. Gumbo was yummy w/ a bit white rice n fried chick is succulent and fresh. Her Mimosa was ok and served on tiny glass for kids. Or that's what was we thought it was.   Another gf ordered the Po'Boy. It was ok. Abit heavy for her, but she said it was yummy. I didn't try because didn't really look appetizing. The bloody Marry however, was yummy. My shrimp and Grits is the bomb. A bit spicy and heavy for me, but it was perfect for the next day left over snack.     They raised the price, but they need help with construction next door. Please... no more 1 hr waiting anymore, thumbs up for expanding.

With in 5mins. of touching down in SF, we got a texted that read "Brenda's French Soul Food". Tired and hungry, I was so down!   We got seated in an area were the tables are close together, which is an invitation to eat as a community, and make friends.  Not only did I network, but the table next to me gave me one of their crawfish beignets.  Then a parade of dish came to the table, I got ribs and my homie got the friend chicken, of course we shared. This was a great dinner, great conversation with the locals, great service ( who wouldn't like cute girls bringing you Mac n' Cheese).  All they need is a little bed for a nap after the meal and it would have been perfect!

HEY SOUL SISTA, Brenda PLEASE expand your seating so I dont have to wait 1+ hours to eat! (from my observations 3pm on saturday has the least crowd) From the 7x7 100 things in SF you gotta eat before you die ----Shrimp Po' boys: YUMMY w/ the chipotle sauce & crunchy shrimp, but not to die for! comes w/ coleslaw but for an extra buck or two I substituted it with a HUGE cup of their fabulous GUMBO what our table really enjoyed here were the BROILED OYSTERS!! (only offered after 3pm so its a good thing we were seated after this time!) I tried 2 of the 4 different kinds. all VERY MEATY & served on the half shell! ----the voodoo: bbq flavored but my fav!! ----the casino: not my favorite but it was my other friends' fav! for DESSERT: the granny smith beignets weren't sweet enough... very bread-y Sign your name on the chalkboard & prepare to wait. From the looks of the trashcan outside, a lot of people hop a block over to "Phil's coffee" to kill time... my friends went to the KFC next door for appetizers because they were starving!

I've seen so many pictures and posts about the beignets at Brenda's that I really wanted to try them. My sister and I bravely trekked through the Tenderloin and were excited to see that there was no line outside (probably because it was a week day, teeheehee!). We were seated immediately upon entering and my first impression of the place was how nice it was inside: clean, modern, high ceilings. Our waitress was nice and laid-back. We had trouble deciding what to order and she told us that we could get 1/2 orders of the french toast and sweet potato pancakes which were a 'special of the day.' I think it's great that they let you order 1/2 orders because that means we get to try more dishes and don't have as many leftovers to carry home. We also got the beignet flight with 1 of every flavor- plain, cinnamon apple, chocolate, and spicy crawfish. This was my first time eating beignets and they turned out to be denser than I thought they would be. I thought the plain was too dense and bread-y and I didn't care for the cinnamon apple. My favorite was the spicy crawfish which was dusted with paprika on top and was cheesy inside. The chocolate beignet was also a winner. It was super chocolate-y and the chocolate was good quality! The beignets were big and definitely can be ordered as an entree. The sweet potato pancakes tasted like gingerbread pancakes and the caramel pecan sauce that came with it was good but too sweet and overpowering. I didn't like their french toast. There was nothing special about them. In SF you expect french toast to be jazzed up with interesting toppings or ingredients but these were underwhelming. The people around us ordered savory dishes that all looked amazing and had huge portions. I'd definitely want to come back to try the watermelon iced tea, gumbo, red rice and beans, and other soul food staples.

I guess I'm the only one that does not like this place. Went with a friend a couple of weeks ago to try it out.  I was excited because the food looked great, at least on paper.   The spot itself has no ambiance whatsoever, with tables that are literally right next to each other in a long area that looks like a hallway.  The music was so loud you could not hear the person dining with you.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind music while dining but I don't want to feel like I'm at a rock concert. We placed our order which took at least 45 minutes to arrive.  Other people who had come in after us were served before us.  The service was friendly but terribly slow and inefficient.   I received my water as we were paying the bill. I ordered pancakes which showed up burnt and though edible still had that charcoal flavor.  I also ordered the rice and beans dish, which was very tasty and filling.  That dish was the ONLY good thing about this place. One star for the beans and rice dish. One more star because I guess with all the great reviews here I couldn't justify only one star :) If I am ever in that area again and wanting to grab a bite, I'd go to the Taco Bell on the corner.

Throwing out the 4 stars because I thought the beignets were a little lacking. They were just tougher and less pillowy than the really good stuff. That said, we got the flight of beignets and got to sample them all and I think I liked the crawfish one the most. The Paprika on top was a really nice touch. I really liked my oyster omelette thing though and the biscuit was deliciously buttery, as were the grits which perhaps bordered on too buttery. My favorite part of the meal was probably the fried chicken drumstick I got on the side. The skin was excellent, the meat was juicy and the batter had just enough of it's own kick to take that chicken up to the next level.

The Beignets were filled with crawfish, chocolate, apples, and plain. Each was really good! Sweet potato pancake was quite amazing. It wasn't too sweet and had just the right amount of pecan syrup. Fried catfish po boy....seriously can't go wrong with fried seafood, but this was exceptional! The shrimp and grits was the consensus favorite dish. It had layer after lay of flavor and the various textures added to the party in your mouth. And if the party wasn't enough, it was also the after-party! The watermelon iced tea, which is a house specialty, is refreshing beyond belief. It goes perfectly when eating heavy foods!

Brenda's is, without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area. It is NOT the healthiest of restaurants, by any stretch of the imagination, but when you sit down in the quaint little eatery and take one look at the menu, you just dont care. I was certainly quick to make up an excuse as to why I'd wait till tomorrow to start eating healthy again. We couldn't pass up the beignets, but had a hard time choosing which kind to order. But not to fear:  It's as if the ever-accommodating owners anticipated this dilemma so they provide you with a great option: the flight of beignets, or simply put: one of each.  You get a plain, a chocolate, an apple, and the surprisingly delicious and savory crawfish beignet, sprinkled with cayenne powder - quite possibly my favorite. I also ordered the house made granola pancakes with fresh fruit and maple syrup.  This seemingly simple pancake really hit the spot - fluffy and tasty pancakes covered with a layer of Brenda's unique, crunchy and ever-so-satisfying granola.  These pancakes (served in a pair) were incredible, but unfortunately I couldn't eat them both.  I was told after they cleared my plate, however, that you can actually order a single pancake! Again, very accommodating of them.  And something to note here: service was served all around with a smile. The last thing I'll make note of was the Proud Mary drink that I ordered - the absolutely mouth watering Southern take on the bloody mary, Louisiana-fied with special creole spices, a pepper, and okra in place of the more traditional celery stick.   Food, drink, atmosphere, service...this place was five stars all around.  My only problem is that I wish it was in LA!

French Soul food? I had my doubts. I was actually on my way to Mama's with a friend. It was a Monday and for some reason they are closed Mondays. We jumped back in the car and proceeded to take a half hour journey through the city to Brenda's, 1.2 miles away. We show up at around 1 and had to wait only about 15 minutes. The restaurant is freakishly tiny, and I was already thinking that she needed to expand. If you don't mind sitting right next to others while eating (cafeteria style, basically) then you will continue to enjoy this artery stopping meal of complete bliss. Beignet, beignet, beignet, beignet... Yes ALL 4 of them for 8 bucks! I had no idea what a beignet was until I actually saw one for myself. The beignet flight come with all 4 beignets that they make. Crawfish stuffed, Ghirardelli chocolate filled, Apple cinnamon, and plain (with fresh strawberry jam, don' t forget!).It was difficult for me to grasp the concept of the beignet until I saw and ate it for myself. The beignet flight was so good we got two flights to-go and shared them with friends and fam. My friend and I also split the shrimp grits (recommended by waitress); I really wasn't expecting much out of a grit dish, but was totally shocked to find myself incapable of stopping the spoon from going into my mouth with loads of cheesy grits and shrimp on it. I was already so full from the beignets that I didn't think I could get any grits down. WRONG. We ate all them grits without a hitch. TIP: Not for the weak circulatory system.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but this place is only 3 stars in my book! why??! On a Saturday morning, you 1) have to wait for about 1+ hr to be seated with a party of 2! You write your name on the chalkboard near the register, which someone can easily erase (luckily, that didn't happen to us!) 2) the parking meter is running, so you have to go back and feed the meter every hour. (so basically, you pay $2 ($2/hr) for just waiting), then another $2 for seating there and eating. I HIGHLY suggest to come on Sunday (no parking meter!), non-peak hours!! 3) the employee (Asian lady with the crazy hair and tat) was super rude--I asked her if she could call my cellphone when my name was up on the list,  and she said "oh we're super busy, we can't do that--if you stand by the door we can yell your name, but not call your cellphone) I understand you're busy, but you can at least be nicer in how you articulate your answer. 4) The food was just "okay." the only thing worth mentioning is the beignet crawfish. In summary, food, service, and ambiance was just "OK..."

I'm so glad that I don't live around here.  Otherwise, I'd go here every weekend!   I highly recommend getting the flight of beignet.  There's no practical reason not to--aside from not really wanting it. While I have tried fluffier beignets from another kitchen, the different fillings made these so much more interesting.  If you're going with a small party, *share* the food.  There's no reason to overindulge.   The beignets and the coffee are fair enough for an early morning breakfast.  If you go for brunch, the oyster omelette would be my recommendation.  It's hardy, tasty and definitely what you would never make at home.  After all, don't we eat out because we can't as easily make those same meals at home?

Last night, I fell in love with NOLA.  I've never been there, but with food like this, I think I could live there.   I can't eat a lot at a time, so I couldn't decide between the BFC, Housemade Sweet Potato Dumplings, Catfish Po'boy, Crawfish Beignets, Hushpuppies or Baked Brie en Croute Salad!  Too many choices, huh.   As we were getting seated, the table next to me was having this delicious Beignet, since I'd never had one before, I wasn't sure if that was the Beignet or the Hushpuppies.  I was with six awesome coworkers, and most of my table ordered the Crawfish Beignet, so I was peer pressured by them and the neighboring table into getting that.  The Beignet was delicious, that was my first time having one.  I thought the crawfish smelt very fishy, if seafood bothers you, I don't really recommend it.   My main course was a side, I didn't think I could handle any of the entrees after that huge Beignet.  I got one BFC, and you get to pick what part of the chicken's body you want.  I picked the breast.  It was so juicy!   I got a little too involved in reviewing the food, I also want to point out the Watermelon Ice Tea.  It's got real watermelon pieces in it, it can't get much better than that!

Story: American brunch is trending in Asia. At first you're excited for a taste of home, then you get to the brunch and the plate has two stringy pieces of bacon with a mediocre eggs benedict and the thinnest slices of fruit. You're so hungry afterwards you eat a package of ramen back at the house. Coming back to the U.S I wanted a REAL American (America!) brunch. If there's one thing we're good at, it's brunch. If there's one place to secure the best homecoming, go to Brenda's, it doesn't matter if you no creole. Heaps of oysters hiding in your scramble! Creamy grits and addictive big beignets. I really thought beignets  were like turkish and middle eastern hummus, not that different from american donuts. I was so wrong, almost apologetically, biting into one made me want to cry. So rich, thick ish crispy, chewy, hot. I wanted more things on the menu but I couldn't fit it into my stomach. No one love watermelon more than me. Except for the japanese person who invented the square one and the more recent watermelon carriage. I think Brenda's was almost too generous with the watermelon, not enough bitterness balanced from the tea. I think it could've been colder, it just tasted like leftover watermelon juice at the bottom of the fruit salad. The biscuits were pretty fluffy but tasted more like lard with flour than buttermilky puffs of heaven. It just wasn't doing it for me. The pork belly on my daily special grits didn't taste very fresh, rather over frozen. Just like fresh fish shouldn't smell fishy, fresh pork shouldn't smell...porky in the bad way. Ambiance: I really appreciated the natural daylight streaming in from the high windows.

So first things first. The wait was half an hour for brunch.  Being the impatient man I am, in my mind I said "this better be worth it".   And just like Beyonce in her Loreal commercial, Brenda's let me know by the food why I waited, "Because I'm WORTH IT!" And it was worth it.  I ordered the sampler of all the Beignets, gumbo bowl, and shrimp and grits.   The gumbo was a nice mix of okra and sausage.  Not as much bite as I expected but delicious nonetheless.  All the Beignets were good, but the stand out to me was the crawfish beignet.  My favorite thing I ate at Brenda's. Then came my shrimp and grits.  It was very tasty.  The only thing is it's unbelievably rich.  I think my personal preference is to eat grits without cheese.  As Denzel said in Remember the Titans "Ya over cooking my grits coach.".  Just in my opinion, Cheese and grits on separate plates, maybe even at separate meals at different times of the day. Going to Brenda's for brunch was a meal and an experience.  Despite the wait I enjoyed it. Why? Because Brenda's is WORTH IT.

I discovered Brenda's (with the help of Yelp) recently and can't believe I haven't been coming here all along, especially when I was living in San Francisco! My first visit here was on a Saturday afternoon, and since I already had lunch, my friend and I were supposed to pop in for a quick bite and try Brenda's famous crawfish beignets. We sat down and I took one look at my neighbor's cheddar shrimp&grits and oyster flight and decided I had to try those too. WOW. So good we savored each bite and completely forgot about the meter and walked out to find not 1 but 2 parking tickets!!! I've only had 2 visits but so far i have LOVED everything that I've tried : crawfish beignets - super yummy  and larger than I thought for $2.50 brie en croute salad-light even with the brie and not drowning in dressing oyster flight - i definitely prefer my oysters raw but I loved the variety shrimp&cheddar grits-THE BEST Thing EVER! fried chicken-super crispy perfectly seasoned+you can buy it by the piece banana bread something for dessert - perfect way to end a meal Brenda's just got their own beer and wine license so unfortunately no more bring your own bottle for free, but their cork fee is $10 per bottle which is pretty reasonable.

I came here today at 4pm, awaiting my first meal. I was hungry, so incredibly hungry. This place was going to be empty, I knew it would be empty. It was empty. I walked in and was greeted, table for one. The waitress asked if I wanted watermelon iced tea, which I happily agreed to. I got me a flight of oysters and hushpuppies. I was ready, sooooo ready to scarf all of it down. So I sit there, and I go through three glasses of watermelon iced tea because my stomach roared for calories. I sit, I look around, I wait... I'm waiting, I'm waiting, then I decide to distract myself with my book. Today was Studious Saturday, and I had both a book and a paper waiting to be finished. So after awhile, I hear this random crash. All the dishes had fallen on the floor. There was a guy mopping the floor and the woman who was supposed to be bringing me my food, I didn't know what happened. So, I go back to reading my book. My stomach roared and roared, it wasn't allowing me to function unless I had satisfied its craving. So I wait some more, and I'm starting to feel a bit crazy. The woman comes out and delivers food to the couple that came 10 minutes after me.. WTF? Their food smells so good. I'm mad, super mad! Ten more minutes go by. "Where is my food?!" I'm wondering. By then, I had figured out that the plates that hit the floor were mine. Five more minutes, my food finally arrives. Hushpuppies so, so, so, so, SO DELICIOUS! Lots of aioli, I lurve me lots of aioli! The oysters were quite good, too. Sauce so delicious. Wowzas. Afterwards, I was still hungry. "Omg she took too long so I had to eat myself," my stomach told me. Waitress came to take my dishes away and then gave me the check. ..and then I went down the street and bought myself a sandwich. Okay, I probably wouldn't have been as angry if that weren't my first meal of the day.. So I'll give you that. But really, if something were to happen to my meal, I'd appreciate it if you told me at least something. I sat there, feeling like I was going insane, and not a peep came out of her. A notice that I'd have to wait ten extra minutes would be cool, but no. I felt like Radish Boy in the tree in that episode of Hey Arnold, "Any minute now... Any minute now... Any minute now!!" I felt like she should have told me about the specials. The menu was a one-sided half-sheet of paper. Tell me you have dessert? You'd probably get a higher tip and a happier customer. Options, we like options! Other than that, I didn't see any of the dishes that were mentioned here, such as the beignets. Boo. Maybe next time.

French soul food---where else do you hear something like this? ordered: -the beignets!!! (the one with 4 diff fillings) -spiced, gingerbread pancakes..something like that -grits and beef cutlets with gravy (it had these but I don't remember the actual name of it) Okay, for anyone's first time, the beignets are a MUST! I don't think I've ever closed my eyes just to savor every single bite. deep fried dough never tasted so good. The crawfish filled one was surprisingly delicious. The pancakes were also great-fluffy, and SLIGHTLY crisp. you can definitely taste the spice in it. The beef and grits were okay. The grits and gravy were VERYYYY rich. So rich it was hard to finish it. Next time, I'd forgo the grits and get like..a biscuit or something to soak up the gravy. It was just too much, but 4 stars because of the incredibly long line. When we got there, it looked like they were expanding the restaurant-thank goodness. We waited about an hour to get a seat. It was definitely worth the wait, though. I thought the concept of having to write your name on the waitlist chalk board was very clever and added to the experience. Will definitely come back here again (this time, right when it opens. got here around 9:30 on a Sunday). This place is also walking distance from the BART (about 20 min or less?)

Definitely expect at least a 2 hour wait if you arrive after 9:30 or 10:00 am. The crawfish beignets were my favorite though!!! Everything else I shared wasn't that great: shrimp and goat cheese omelette (watery with too much goat cheese and barely any shrimp - I don't think the shrimp and goat cheese mixed well together in terms of taste anyway), and the grits were bland. When I return I will be ordering only the beignets.

This is a must try for brunch. Amazing eggs benedict, one of the best in the city. The service is great, the staff always fills your glass of water, very impressed with their attentiveness. The beignets are a must try, I recommend getting the sample platter so you can try all 4... they are very filling so make sure to save room for your meal. Hope you enjoy! For the most part the line is pretty long, expect to wait at least an hour if you are going on a weekend day during prime time 11AM - 2PM. The best luck I have is going on a weekday or early on the weekend. The line is usually shorter and you can get right in or wait at least 10 minutes.

You must get the crawfish beignet!! We did the beignet flight and it was to die for!  We also had the chorizo omelet which was mediocre and the blueberry cream cheese French toast which was phenomenal and the spinach and goat cheese omelet was pretty good but slightly overwhelming... Overall you MUST go here while in San Fran, even If the service is slow! Also the neighborhood is VERY sketchy. Three girls walking down the streets at 10am was not very safe! But worth it.

A line out the door on a Monday morning?! Don't people have to work?! Why are they creating time between me and my first experience at Brenda's?! The high reviews plus the small seating area is a sure way to create a line.  Well, the food was well worth the wait (a ~30 minute wait to be exact). It's always a good sign when the group next to you is happily, and loudly raving about the meal they just devoured, and when asked- they tell you every single item on the menu is wonderful. Friend and I split the Egg and Bacon Tartine that came with a side of potatoes. SO. GOOD. I personally recommend it. Portions are very filling! Dishes can definitely be shared, but of course more the merrier so treat yourself to your own! We also had the Watermelon Sweet Tea which was black tea and watermelon puree. Fresh and refreshing! Get a glass of that. A lot of people were getting the Beinet Flight which also looked yums. Would go back again for a great start of a San Francisco day!

Came here over a year ago, and had the cat fish po-boy and their beignets. You know, it was ok. Everything was tasty. What stood out for me was their house pickles. Needed lunch before going to Philz (kinda around the block), so I came back here. Ordered the shrimp and grits and a side of pickles. The shrimp and grits were really good. That bacon/tomato gravy just made the dish. However, it was kinda super cheesy. Like, they put a lotta cheese on that dish. It felt a little heavy after awhile. What stood out for me this time was... the pickles. They have these watermelon pickles.. it's spicy and sour and oh so good. God.. I love pickles (no homo).

I love going here for lunch! I love that they remodeled and made it bigger! It does still seem small but I remember it to be 1/3 of the space it is now. So I'm Ecstatic! I've only gone here during the weekdays for breakfast and  lunch (I usually go at 11:30 to avoid the rush.) I love their PoBoys and all of their fried seafood items!! Beignets are good, not smashing but good; Can't make a decision which one? try the sampling platter. Ice Teas are refreshing and rejuvenating! They do have specials that vary day to day. Big tip for newbies: When you come in, write your name and # of party on the chalkboard. I don't how many times I've seen people look clueless trying to get the attention of the busy people tending to the seated patrons.

Have again: The grits were creamy, buttery and delicious. The beignets were delicious - I really liked the chocolate and the crawfish with cayenne, scallions & cheddar beignets. Plain was also delicious. Never got to try the Granny Smith Apple, with cinnamon honey butter since my son ate the entire one. Maybe have again: the hang town scramble with crispy oysters and bacon was good, but the eggs were over-cooked. And, most everyone else was having eggs benedict with catfish. I was not impressed with the cream biscuit. There was a long line outside, but I went for the stool at the "bar" and got served right away.

Second time is a charm.  Two of the four, myself included attempted to come before, but was deterred by the wait.  Today, we waited.  And it was worth the wait. Put your name on the black chalkboard inside, and wait for your name to be called.  You can order a drink while you wait which is nice. All four of us got the sweet watermelon tea.  Nice, but needed more ice. After a 30+ minute wait, our name was called.   We dined family style for lunch, and got the following: *po boy oyster sandwich *muffaleta sandwich *shrimp and grits *beignet flight Group consensus that both the oyster po boy and shrimp/grits were the definite winners. Muffaleta was good, but I'm not sure would order again. Of the four beignets, the plain sugar glaze one was the best.  Then the apple one.  Chocolate good, and the least favorite the cayenne one. We said we would definitely come back.  The shrimp po boy looked really good. Total including tax & tip was $65.00.

FINALLY made it to Brenda's after a year of saying "oh yeah I wanna go there this weekend!" and all I could think when I was eating was "Holy cow, my taste buds have been MISSING OUT all this time." We waited about 45 minutes but the TL and clientele waiting outside of Brenda's kept us entertained.  Don't let the wait discourage you from eating here.  It's like an extra long drumroll before you have an epic first kiss.   IT IS WORTH IT. Gonna ditto pretty much everything anyone ever comments on.  Beignets are bommbbb.  We got the sampler but honestly I could have done a plate of just crawfish beignets, they were unbelievable.  Obviously had to try the catfish po' boy for my first time - delicious, although a touch salty for my taste.  Next time I'm gonna try the shrimp and goat cheese omelet because that looked incredible too.  Can't wait to come again!

Was here for the first time because of the lots of great reviews and it's also in walking distance from my place. Got there at around 12.30, didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes to get seated. Ordered a Watermelon Iced Tea, Crawfish Beignet, and Hangtown Fry (oyster, bacon, and scallion scramble with grits and biscuit). Bf ordered a Bloody Mary, Croquet Monsieur (baked ham & gruyère with sauce on sourdough with cole slaw), and a side of Andoille Sausage. We also ordered Hushpuppies (cornbread balls). The 'bomb' watermelon iced tea everyone talks about here was blah, nothing special and I didn't like it. Crawfish beignet was really good, it came first and we got pretty full right away. Then the hushpuppies came, it was pretty good / not bad. Finally, my hangtown fry came, the omellete was huge and it was pretty good i think. Not a big fan of the oyster. My first taste of the grits was really good, then it started to taste too creamy and wet (I like the grits I usually make myself much better), it seemed so fattening. The biscuit was good.   My bf thought his bloody mary was just ok. He liked the crawfish beignet too. He thought that the Croquet Monsieur was good (he's French and he approved). The coleslaw was blah. He said the Andoille sausage was ok. We were so full and couldn't finish any of the food, and took everything to go. The bill was around $50. Overall, it was a good experience, I liked the place and enjoyed the food, it was also good portion. although food took a while to come out. We don't think that it was that amazing, but will definitely come back, just not anytime soon. I recommend it.

I just want to know why food that is so good for your soul is so bad for you in general? Seems cruel to me, but I digress... I'm just going to say right out of the gate that Brenda's makes a damn fine biscuit. In fact there are only a handful of places that I've had better biscuits and none of those places are in San Francisco. So if you are a biscuit lover you need to try these out. Same goes with a beignet. And the grits for that matter. These items are truly southern in my mind and the fact that Brenda's makes them the way I think southern versions should be is fantastic. Brenda's is also one of a few places that I've had chicory coffee in the city. Did you know that there is no caffeine in chicory? If it's a blend with regular coffee though there will be caffeine. I admire the novelty of that if nothing else. The place is very tiny, however on a weekday mid-morning the wait was nonexistent and I can definitely get down with that. And while my breakfast here was great I am not a waiting type of person so there's no way I'd wait over 30 minutes to eat here. The food was good, but definitely not worth a higher level of hangry (hungry + angry.)

A:  "I wonder why all the good breakfast places have women's names?  Brenda's, Dottie's, Chloe's, Mama's ..." J:  "It's because when women wake up, they should go to to the kitchen and cook breakfast!" A:  "You are a dead man." With Brenda's help, I attempted to kill J. Operation "Death by Butter" started out with Brenda's awesome Beignet Flight and steaming cups of Cafe au Lait.  The plain beignet could not compete with the sweet chocolate one and the cinnamon-sugary apple one.  But actually the savory, cheesy, spice dusted crawfish beignet was our favorite. Then we inhaled piles of grits oozing with pools of yellow butter and "the best I've ever had" biscuits alongside.  The homemade jam with big chunks of peaches was so good I had to talk myself out of pilfering the entire jar.  (You are welcome.) To go with our butter-carb fest, we had the Hangtown Fry (scrambled eggs, fried oysters, potatoes, green onions) and the Grillades (beef cutlets braised in Creole gravy).  I loved the fried oysters and the creole gravy as they had just the right amount of spice and were a culinary flashback to the rich and colorful flavors of the amazing city of N'awlins. J did not die. But he WAS incapacitated by a big, fat, buttery food coma. Mmmwwwaahahaha!

"Brenda"...(*gets on one knee*) "Will you marry me" Ahhh!! My mom's heart flutters and faints from pure joy and happiness just at the thought. Psyche! haha sorry moms..not gonna happen...you ain't getting no babies from me. Babies are selfish.  I'm sorry but when's a baby gonna massage my shoulders and tell me how pretty I am?  I know I shouldn't say this but babies are gross.  Yuck! what happens if I accidentally have an ugly baby like Angelina's baby Zahara.  That girls hair is nnnnn-appy!  She needs to put away some of that eye too.  Its taking over her entire face.   I know I'm sorry I've been giving out a lot of 5 stars lately.  I feel like the kindergarten teacher handing out gold stars.  Can't help it, I've been eating really well, maybe a little too well.  (*pats belly*) This place is so small it makes my room look like a mansion.  The wait to get a table for this place is a bit ridiculous.  If you get here before 9, I think the wait isn't as bad.   The crawfish beignets were the bomb diggety.  I'm sorry that shit was the shit.  Huge puffs covered in an alarming amount of seasoning that looked daunting.  At first I thought it was gonna be too seasoned, but it was absolutely awesome!  Delicious and tasty.   I share an eggs Benedict addiction just like Tom R.  My innate reaction to seeing that word makes me order it.  I got the fried catfish version that was epic.  My one gripe was the potatoes, to me it was a waste of carbs.  I was too full to waste my time on the potatoes. The catfish po'boy was delicious, I liked the chipotle sauce, and the bread was absolutely divine.   Daniel chose the Hangtown Fry which I thought was yummy.  It had fried oysters and bacon in it which was revolutionary.  I used the buttery buscuit that came with it as a receptacle for their delicious strawberry jam.   Shrimp and grits was definitely decadent.  It was delicious but I don't think I could have eaten the whole dish.  It was super heavy with cheese and shrimp, but it was a definite standout.   My mom might not get a baby from my copulation attempts.  But I think if I keep eating this way, people are gonna think I'm pregnant.  Dam...I guess I should stop eating for 2 now.

OMG. I first came here on my first trip to SF with my cousins back in 2010 and came back on another trip in April. I hate the cold, but I will brave SF's cold winds and steep hills for this place. I've only ordered the Po'Boy with fried oysters for myself and greedily tried a piece of everyone else's plate. Everything was amaziiiiing, but I didn't wanna take up too much room in my stomach with everyone else's food and save the room for my delicious sandwich. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The Po'Boy is a must! Also, the beignets are delicious. The sweet stuff (I think it was apples and chocolate) was good, but what the crawfish beignet was surprisingly delicious. If you're in town, definitely try this place out. Get there as early as possible, as the wait is usually pretty long.

Comfort. Is my ratty Ugg slippers. Is my flannel pajama pants and 10+ year old favorite t-shirt. Is reading a good novel under the covers in my uber-comfy king-size bed. Is spending a leisurely Saturday morning with a person who knows you inside out and feeling that amazing connection found once in a blue moon. Is Brenda's sweet potato pancakes with pecan praline syrup, Brenda's cream biscuits smothered with homemade peach jam, Brenda's extra-buttery grits, Brenda's potato hash and Brenda's fried oyster and bacon omelet. Brenda, you got soul. Your food made me so happy that it caused me to display random acts of kindness all day for no reason other than that I felt giddy, warm, happy and loved after having brunch at your restaurant. The answer to world peace may be in Brenda's sweet potato pancakes smothered with a brown sugar, pecan and butter concoction that could make anyone forget about differences in religion, politics, or why you broke up. Why should such trivial things matter when we can focus on the things that really matter in life, the things that unite us as humans: good food and good company?

Finally went there today and had the Grillades and Grits (Beef cutlets braised in spicy Creole gravy served over grits, with two eggs and a biscuit). It was very good but I wasn't completely blown away (like some of the other reviews claimed I would be). I'll more than likely go back and try it again so I can try their Egg and Bacon Tartine (Bacon, scrambled egg, Gruyère and tomato-bacon relish on a toasted French roll) or possibly go back for lunch. Oops, hold on. I'm watching 24 and Jack Bauer just did something very Jack Bauery so I'll update this review later.

Carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs. I usually limit myself to one carb when indulging in breakfast out. If I have potatoes I tend not to touch my toast. When I decide to eat my english muffin I ignore my hash browns to the point that they get a complex. I just don't need that many carbs. I have eggs and bacon and other distractions on my plate. I am convinced I could eat a meal comprised entirely of carbs here. Dare I say I would push my beloved bacon to the side of my plate to get my fill of beignets, grits, potatoes and the only biscuits in town that warm the cockles of my heart. However, the cockles of my heart are only warmed here on a weekday. I pity the fool who would wait in line for any meal that is so incredibly unhealthy. Even if it is in a cute little place that puts chicory in their coffee, has a deep red brink wall, Etta James playing far too quietly in the background and homemade jam the wait on weekends is insane.

I have a favorite restaurant in SF.  Yeah, I might have a favorite coffee house, a favorite bakery, a favorite oyster bar, a favorite for each Yelp restaurant category (and then some), but there's THE favorite among the favorites. The food here makes me speak less, savor more, linger longer, and want to live in the oh-so-tender 'Loin forever.  It is Brenda's French Soul Food.  And it's worth the two-hour wait on weekends.  In the cold.  While it rains.  Sans rain boots. The menu is short but satisfying.  There are three dishes that I can never get enough of.  First, the French toast with butter pecan sauce is better than the stuff at your grandma's, at that chi-chi resort restaurant, and anything I've had for breakfast in France for that matter.  The cinnamon toast is WOW, but the warm sauce is WHOA--simply the best I've ever had. Next, the Hangtown fry is an omelet to salivate over, take photos of, and blog about.  It reinforces the small wonder that are eggs, the idea that bacon makes everything better, and that oysters are delicious in every form.   It also comes with a fresh biscuit, which is staggeringly delicious with the homemade strawberry jam. Finally, the shrimp 'n grits for those who slept through breakfast and will drink through dinner--this is a one meal deal to get you through the entire day.  The shrimp is fresh and meaty, the grits rich and fluffy, and the sauce a blend of savory, sweet, spicy, and to-die-for.  These are the dishes I've gotten over and over again, and have never gotten over. For the few with an appetite bigger than mine, the beignets (French fritters) make a great starter or side.  The chocolate one is sinfully good, but it's the crawfish one that in retrospect you'll wish you devoured slower or saved for last.  It could use more crawfish but is otherwise marvelous. I take everyone I know here, from my boyfriend, to my visiting family and friends, to my ex-boyfriend.  None of them have anything in common except that they really like me... uh, I mean, Brenda's.  Brenda's comforts my soul with its food, drives me crazy with its line, draws me to New Orleans, gets on my nerves with its chock-full of elbow -to-elbow tables, reminds me of how lucky I am to be living in a food mecca--but that's the rollercoaster of love.  And I'm not getting off it.

I love working from home!!!!  It was a Monday, and I made sure I went to lunch at Brenda's.  I went to pick up my friend downtown, and we got to Brenda's at 11:30.  There was already a wait list!!  But we were the fourth name, so we were inside by about 11:45....whew! We had time to browse the specials board outside, so we already knew what we wanted to order.  I got the crawfish & andouille pot pie( http://static.px.yelp.co… ), my friend got the shrimp & grits( http://static.px.yelp.co… ), and of course we had to get the crawfish beignets( http://static.px.yelp.co… ). The beignets came out first and OMG...they were so good!  They were piping hot and super cheeeesy in the middle.  I loved my pot pie....but I was a bit too anxious to eat it because I burned my tongue!  The pot pie had lots of cheesy goodness mixed in with the crawfish and andouille....very delicious!  I had a few bites of the shrimp & grits, and that was awesome, too!  They're very generous with the shrimp.  Everything was YUMMY! I've heard the wait here can get pretty long, so go early!  It looks like they bought the space next door, so they can expand....hopefully soon!  I can't wait to work from home again, so I can come back for lunch!

"Brenda's is now serving brunch on Saturdays from 8 AM - 3 PM!" I found this on her website. It's not noted on the hours posted on the window. I'm sure she kept it off there for a reason, and I'm sure people are going to hate me for sharing this secret, if it is one. But I just LOVE Brenda's beignets and po'boys so much that I had to share it with all of you, because I LOVE YOU ALL and you MUST try them! The beignets are TO DIE FOR. We ordered the beignet flight, which consisted of 1 of each of the following: Plain, Filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate, Granny Smith Apple with cinnamon honey butter and Crawfish with cayenne, scallions and cheddar. All 4 for $8. We ate them in that order, starting with the crawfish beignet. It was the most amazing beignet I had ever eaten. Ever. I'd never even had a savory beignet before, and I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but it was absolutely the most scrumptious thing. My next favorite was the apple beignet. Oh, that thing was better than any apple pie I'd ever had. Surprisingly, the chocolate one was only ok for me. I'm so glad we ordered the sampler, because I would've gone straight for the chocolate one. The plain, was, well, plain, but still very good! My fried shrimp po'boy sandwich was huge. But I managed to finish almost all of it because it was so tasty! The fries it came with were also very crisp and delicious. I asked for a side of pesto buttermilk dressing to dip the fries in - a must! Don't forget to get some freshly made watermelon iced tea. It is so refreshing! Luckily, we didn't have to wait at all for a table in this tiny little place, where Brenda is in plain sight cooking in the kitchen. It's a tight squeeze, so make sure you don't wear any low-rider jeans if you happen to sit at the counter. I had a nas-tay view of someone's badonkadonk.

I woke up Sunday morning with a hankerin' for a brunch adventure. Having noticed Brenda's as wildly popular on Yelp, I finally decided to follow up with one of my many long-ignored bookmarks. I roosted my roommate out of her peaceful slumber and informed her with a grin that we'd be entering the Tenderloin. After a quick coffee pit-stop, Mollie agreed to speak to me again, and we embarked on our journey. I'd been warned of the popularity of Brenda's, and was anticipating a formidable wait. What I hadn't expected was a line wrapped damn near 'round the adjacent Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not easily deterred, I put my name on the list and we wandered around to do a little urban sight-seeing. The Marina girls oohed and aahed at all the T-loin's exotic tweakers, and after a half hour or so we returned to check on the progression of the line. I approached the clipboard to see if any names had been crossed off, and who should I have the pleasure of running into but two of SF's finest Yelpers- Angelo F. and Theron L. Even more fortuitous was that Angelo was the very next name on the list, and he was kind enough to let us crash his table. Within minutes we were seated, and popping open the bottle of champagne that Theron had cleverly bought during their two-hour wait. We ordered up a feast, and divided it family style amongst the four of us.  Holy heart failure Batman! Fried catfish, shrimp and bacon cheddar grits, oyster po'boys, andouille gumbo, and molten Ghiradelli chocolate beignets, all washed down by watermelon mimosas. Everything was positvely delectable- every bit as authentic as the soul food I enjoyed in New Orleans. My only regret? Not wearing drawstring sweatpants. Thanks to the wonderful staff, Theron and Angelo, and the Brunch Gods for blessing us with a truly miraculous dining experience.

THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.  I came on a Sunday morning for brunch, put my name on the list and had to wait about an hour for a table.  Totally worth it.  While you wait, they give you coffee, which is pretty nice.   We started out with the beignet flight.  I got a special (which was cheese grits with pork belly and a poached egg) and my friend got fried chicken benedict.  Here are my power rankings for all of the food we got: 1) Pork Belly Cheese Grits (Pork belly and cheese grits with a poached egg are my two favorite things.  Combining them is heaven). 2) Chocolate Beignet - Great dough with just enough melted chocolate in the middle 3) Crawfish Beignet - Neck and neck with the chocolate.  It's savory (as opposed to the other three, which were sweet).  It has crawfish and cheese in the middle, is dusted with paprika and has just a little spicy. 4) Apple Beignet - There were not quite enough apples (the middle was baked apples mixed with brown sugar).  Good, but not great. 5) Fried Chicken Benedict - Not bad, but compared to everything else here, it was a little weak.  Also, I've definitely had better fried chicken benedict in the South.  I'm a bit of a fried chicken snob.  The fried chicken was like California fried chicken (i.e. not very good). 6)  Plain Beignet - It was good, but in comparison to the others, it has to fall to the bottom of the list. The first three things in my rankings are so good that they push this place to five stars.  The last three were still good (probably 3.5 stars level).  Also, there were a lot of other things that looked really good.  I will definitely come back next time I'm in San Francisco.

The wait in line for brunch on a Saturday is NOT for the squeamish.  Realize you are in the TL and just might happen to see an extremely overweight white woman crack whore licking the beans off of her Taco Bell bean burrito wrapper, leaving a trail of cheese and refried bean pooh splatters behind. Once you get inside to this extremely small restaurant, after at least an hour wait, you have the wonderful opportunity to try Brenda's tasty treats.  Brenda also lets you bring you own booze (doesn't serve any off the menu) so the ladies and I brought champagne (no corkage fee).  Also, drink booze out of brown paper bags while waiting in line outside.  You will get a nice buzz and feel one with the TL and burrito licking crack whores. We ordered the crawfish beignets, oyster and bacon scramble and shrimp and goat cheese omelet topped with tomato-bacon relish.  The beignets were amazing (wish I had ordered 10).  The omelet and scramble were delicious as well.  Anything with goat cheese, bacon and oysters makes me all giddy inside. I will say Brenda's is worth the wait, but a wait I'm not willing to do again for at least 6 months.

I took a short mid-morning stroll from the courthouse after an unexpectedly brief appearance to see if my luck continued.  To my surprise...no line at Brenda's!  Ka-Pow!  Finally, no more drooling over past reviews and photos and I'm finally checking off one of the premiere breakfast spots in SF from my list.  It was time to take off the jacket and roll up the sleeves for some real deal French soul food. To be honest, my visit was not the gut busting breakfast orgy I expected, but you probably ought to blame my expectations.  I was in such a five star giving mood, so four comes as a little bit of a disappointment.  The plain beignets were too, well, plain.  They were only marginally warm and were slightly dry and bland, except for the powdered sugar .  I know, I know...you're wagging the finger saying "you should have gone for the Crawfish Beignets,"  tsk, tsk.  But I typically try the basics first.  I have my sights set on those next time, believe you me, and there will be a next time.  Also, coffee was nice and smooth, but not nearly hot enough for my taste. Apart from minor setbacks, the shrimp po' boy pulled me in and made me feel all giddy inside.  The sandwich was packed with hearty shrimp, breaded nicely and fried perfectly to stay crispy on the outside, succulent inside, and warm all over.  The chipotle rémoulade was the perfect complement.   Basically, Brenda's is the perfect combination of quality and quantity.  I looked around, every item served filled a large plate.  Patrons were generally happy, many of them were taking pictures of their food.  I have a great deal of admiration for Chef Brenda Buenviaje.  She's made her mark on Bay Area cuisine since moving from New Orleans.  Certainly one of my favorite brunch spots.  I will be back, most def.

Someone cruel took this not-so-flattering photo of me after eating at Brenda's http://www.awildland.org…   The only thing evil about Brenda is that she serves up a mean plate of grits, biscuits, and eggs and then expects you to function normally in society.  Plan on needing some time to recuperate and everything will be fine.

Perhaps it's not fair to review a restaurant based on a brunch experience on SuperBowl Sunday, but for the first time ever, there was no line at Brenda's and the place was nearly empty! Score! The service was good....except...when I asked our server what the specials were, she had to go and read the chalkboard near the cash register before she could tell us. I guess I was supposed to do that for myself, because she seemed rather annoyed at having to do it. I ordered something called a "grillade" from the house specials section of the brunch menu. Beef cutlets in a spicy tomato gravy with grits and eggs. It arrived at the table lukewarm. The eggs, which I ordered over easy, were underdone, with the eggwhite still a bit runny. The grits, spicy tomato gravy, and biscuit, were delicious. The beef cutlet? Well, the image that came to mind as I ate it was 3 rather small slices of somewhat tough leftover pot roast. Not bad, but nothing special by any means. As for ambiance, the music was playing at a probably appropriate level for a restaurant full of diners, but was a little overwhelming for an empty place. Perhaps someone could have adjusted it to better suit the crowd level. Bottom line: I'm glad I finally got to try Brenda's. The food was pretty good, and the price was reasonable. Would I go back? Probably. Would I wait in line for it? Probably not.

Our second weekend brunch at Brendas, and another five star meal. First the food, then the politics of the waiting list and line etiquette. Last time I had the pancakes with vanilla bean cream sauce, and they were the best pancakes I have ever had in my whole life.  Normally I reserve pancake eating for festive occasions like community pancake breakfasts where firefighters with mustaches flip flap jacks.  Every pancake experience I have had prior to Brenda's left me feeling like I had a lump of dough in my stomach for the better part of the day, which is fine if that's the feeling you are going for.  However, Brenda's pancakes were light and airy, and the vanilla bean sauce added just a touch of sweetness, but didn't overpower the pancake.  Deelish. Today I had plain old scrambled eggs, potato hash and a cream biscuit.  You know a place is amazing when they can do plain old brunch just as well as special exciting brunch.  Eggs were light, fluffy and not oily, potato hash had some extra zing, and the biscuit was flaky and buttery but not dense.   Round it out with OJ and a really fantastic cup of coffee (called Snooze blend- the menu says it is "Hand-picked, blended and shipped directly to us from a little farm in Guatemala"), and you have a little bit of French Soul Food Brunch Heaven. Now as to the lines: as we were leaving today (around 11:30) the line outside had grown considerably, and someone wanted to know if it was really worth it, and the answer is YES. However, some things to know about the line: 1) There is a sign in sheet.  Write your name and the size of your party.  Duh. 2) They won't seat you if your whole party isn't there.  So, don't put 4 if your friend's friend's cousin's brother's girlfriend may or may not joining you.  Then, when they call your name and said person is not there, don't have a temper tantrum because they won't seat you.  This place is *tiny* and so they are doing everyone a favor by utilizing every seat.  2 people are not going to be sat at a table for four.   3) DO NOT cross of other people's names who are ahead of yours.  I SAW YOU DO THAT TODAY you in the white shorts.  You are very lucky we, whose names you crossed off, got seated immediately after you, otherwise you would have been dubbed the Asshole Who Wears White Shorts and Cuts In Line.  Bad bad behavior.  No brunch for you. Brenda's is worth the wait, so just be prepared!

I usually don't review the place I went with group of people because I always have fun with people anyway no matter where I went. Especially with my GF, we have so much fun, anywhere we go even though crapy place. I think it is not a same thing between having a good food and having fun. Having a good meal involve food and service. But having fun, good time is, most likely, it's up to the people who you are with. That's just my thing to review for Yelp. My GF always said after she read my review the place we went together, " I didn't know that you didn't like the food, I thought we had so much fun there". Anyway. Today, I am very happy because my son is back from school. I haven't seen him for a while, about 6 months. I went to pick him up at SFO in the early morning and I wanted to take him for breakfast. We always go to Art's cafe on Irving but this time I wanted something different, something special, so we went to Brenda's because I've read good reviews. Eventhough we were having a great time talking, we just couldn't help enjoy and talking about the food. I usualy don't talk when I am eating good food. This place has solid good breakfast. The food shows that Brenda has Soul & Spirit. A small, cozy, good food and hard working nice people. Hey Brenda, TAKE OVER THE FUNNKY TINY LAUNDRY MAT NEXT DOOR! And KFC if you can. Well, I take it back, because I like a small cozy place. I like it. I definitly go back. But I'll go back there in early morning because no waiting line. That is a problem for any popular but small restaurant.

There is something to be said about waking up at 10am on a Sunday morning, throwing on clothes, brushing your teeth and running to catch the 19-Polk bus to get Brenda's that makes these excursions magical. Especially when you're leaving and a crackhead follows you to the bus stop...:| We waited for-wait for it-AN HOUR AND A HALF. Standing. The entire time. He had his book to read, I had Client Engagement & Brief Interventions to study for class--thankfully it was a long chapter. But something about standing and waiting for that long takes it out of you to eat. It almost ruins the experience, to say the least. The fact that the boyfriend waited because I wanted so badly to eat here really says a lot about how selfless he is. So two thumbs up for that! Word to the wise--if stress has you eating like a bird, then chances are ordering a flight of beignets is not going to help your entree. You'll be full by the time you get there. The crawfish beignets were overly sprinkled with paprika (too much), the chocolate ones were good (not in bf's taste), the granny smith apples were amazing and so were the plain. My stomach filled up after two bites (/shakes fist Dammit!) The entrees were pumpkin pancakes with cream cheese whip topping, and the braised beef with eggs, grits and a biscuit. Well, that was delicious. I decided to save the rest after two bites for dinner, but forgot how much food my boyfriend consumes--GAH. I opened it up when I got home and it was almost gone! What the hell, man!?! Well, I got him back later that night when I ate the rest of the beignets as he was out smoking a cigarette. Take THAT, squishy! All in all, I wouldn't wait that long again, but they have good intentions.

This brunch spot is worth the wait, even weekends. Aside from bars on their window, it's a down-home space, filled with old-time music and warm service. Brenda's turns out the tastiest beignets I've had in recent memory. Piping hot, our favorite was the crawfish beignet, stuffed with cayenne, scallions, and the perfect amount of cheddar cheese: not too much, but hardly stingy. Biting into one is a treat; if you can't decide which variety to get, go for the beignet flight. Lucky diners will find the fried catfish po' boy as a special. Its bread is toasted until crisp, while tomatoes add sweetness. The sauce slathered on top can best be described as divine (I want to erect an altar to it), and the contrast between the fried skin and pillowy soft flesh is satisfying. Their coleslaw's a bit subdued, but nobody's perfect.

I have never had French soul food before so I didnt know what to order. I went with the shrimp and goat cheese omelette with potatoes and biscuit. I can easily say I've had better omelets at breakfast in my college dining hall. I should've listened to the other reviews and ordered the beignets. I guess I'm saving them for next time if I come back. the service was meh level. The waiters were "extra busy" whenever we needed to get their attention. It took foreverfor one of my friends orders to come out. Get here early or you'll be waiting outside in line.

My fascination with the mystique and romanticization of La Nouvelle-Orléans lies deep within the history, the culture, and of course, the food. With a piece of the crescent city right here in San Francisco à la Brenda's French Soul Food, you can find southern classics with the special Creole touch even if you can't make it out to the bayou.   Don't miss the flight of beignet for a taste of the little deep fried pillowy pastries filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate, granny smith apple with cinnamon honey butter, and crawfish with cayenne, scallions and cheddar as well as plain. Chipotle rémoulade layered over crispy shrimps in a toasted French roll makes the Shrimp Po'boy heaven on a plate. Chicken sausage & okra gumbo and grits are quintessential to Creole dining. Their daily specials often offer the likes of Hangtown Fry, Étouffée, and Chicken & Andouille Jambalaya. Now all they need is some delta blues playing in the background to complete the picture.

Went here twice in the last week.  It's that good! I hate waiting.  In fact, I'll schedule my day so that I don't have to wait.  That's why I recommend showing up around 10:30 or so on a weekday.  I was able to walk right in, unbutton my pants and get my eat on. The beignet flight is a must.  Although I find that I prefer the crawfish much more than the other ones.  But if you've never had them get the flight and then next time stick to your favorite. Because I have the world's biggest sweet tooth I always go for french toast or pancakes.  DO IT!  So good.  My teeth still hurt.  Yummy times. I've never had any problems with the wait staff but I think because it's a small place and there's always a ton of people waiting that they're a little on edge.  Be nice and be considerate and I think you'll get some solid service. Yay Brenda's!  (I kind of want to have the big 2-5 birthday brunch here.  Brenda, if you're out there, is there any way to do this?)

Brenda's French Soul Food & I meet again!! :D My sister-in-law & I were headed for this area again & decided to grab some breakfast beforehand. Brenda's it is! :) It was busy on this Thursday morning, but luckily we were seated within 5 minutes. We got seated pretty much at the same table as this other couple. I understand that it's a small place, but I felt a little too close to them. I didn't want to move the table over though because that'd be rude, so I just left it alone until after they left, haha. I decided to try something new this time. I ordered the Hangtown Fry = YUMMM!! I'm a fan of oysters, so I enjoyed this dish very much. If you don't like oysters, this probably isn't for you. The biscuit was EXTRA DELICIOUS that day. Idk what it was about it, but I couldn't resist...I had to finish it all! & the strawberry jam was a lovely added touch.

Brenda's French Soul Food & I meet again!! :D My sister-in-law & I were headed for this area again & decided to grab some breakfast beforehand. Brenda's it is! :) It was busy on this Thursday morning, but luckily we were seated within 5 minutes. We got seated pretty much at the same table as this other couple. I understand that it's a small place, but I felt a little too close to them. I didn't want to move the table over though because that'd be rude, so I just left it alone until after they left, haha. I decided to try something new this time. I ordered the Hangtown Fry = YUMMM!! I'm a fan of oysters, so I enjoyed this dish very much. If you don't like oysters, this probably isn't for you. The biscuit was EXTRA DELICIOUS that day. Idk what it was about it, but I couldn't resist...I had to finish it all! & the strawberry jam was a lovely added touch.

Walking out of Brenda's, I can barely move. So stuffed. I decided to close my eyes and hope the gusty wind will propel me back to work. It worked splendidly, for about 5 steps. Jonathan W and I had met up for lunch. To start, we shared a beignet flight. They are fist-size and hefty, filled with deliciousness. After my halves of 4, I was already close to capacity. Fried Shrimp Po'boy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): I thought about just packing it to go. But when the server laid the po'boy in front of me, it looked so good! Golden fried shrimp smothered with spicy aioli. I couldn't resist taking several bites even though my stomach was about to burst. Hot juicy shrimps. Toasted crunchy bread. Mmmm flavor explosion! Definitely deserving to be #42 on the 7x7 Big Eat list! =D

So I came back to Brenda's to give it a second chance since my first experience wasn't as good as what I always read. While I was looking for parking, there was a huge crowd outside and I was getting irritated with the one way streets when I see a parking on the other side! Finally found a parking a the crowd died down with just one group in front of us. The wait wasn't so long and Vincent K. finally came. I felt a little under dressed since he was wearing a dress shirt and tie for work... We got seated at the bar area. The fact that I have to stare at myself being a pig doesn't really help since I am suppose to be dieting.. It was just helping me realize that my diet resolution is not going anywhere.. There was a Fuji Apple pancake that I really wanted to try but then I didn't want breakfast food so I went with the Croque Monsieur with fries. They also didn't have a side of mac and cheese as an option =( We also ordered the crawfish beignets to start. That came out pretty quick.. TOO quick because my beignet was still raw inside! It was still doughy and I could even smell it. They took it back and I thought they were A. either gonna not charge us or B. Give me a new one, not a whole order, just ONE. But instead, they put it in a paper togo bag and gave it to us. Which I thought, they re-fried it for us. But they didn't! GROSS Anyways, my croque monsieur was hella good. Cheesy goodness is the best when you're on a diet. Pretty big portion. I haven't eaten that day and the night before so I was starving but I only finished half of it and I'm still full. Like Vincent said, the fries were too salty.. Service wasn't the best. Atleast in my eyes. My glass was empty and I was dying of thirst since the fries were overly salty. I was staring at Vincent's glass since he had tea and didn't drink his water but I didn't want to be rude and drink his water. I couldn't take it anymore since they obviously wasn't gonna refill my glass so I asked him for his! Thanks Vincent! You saved me! After giving it a second chance, I'm not sure if I would give it a third. It didn't give me a reason to come back. I could just grab a croque monsieur from Tartine since I liked it there better.

I am a fan of the Crawfish Beignets. Unfortunately, these are only good when warm and fresh. So, don't bring it home. Wait for 1.5 hours like I did and eat it there. :) Located in the interesting Tenderloin, this place still attracts a long line. I have to admit that the crawfish beignets are worth it. Oh, and the watermelon ice tea. Free refills, btw. Drink up! The rest of the food are also good and their portion is huge, but they are not outstanding. They definitely dont skimp on their ingredients. I ordered the oyster omelette and it was soooo full of oysters. Is there such a thing as too much of a good thing? I was so sick of oysters when I am done with my omelette. The side biscuits were too floury and dry for me. Grits were very rich and buttery. Everything here is very rich and I think it is their goal to make sure that you are sooo satisfied you won't need to wait in line for 1.5 hours for a while. :P Service was good and fast, but when you arrive, first thing you want to do is to put your name on the chalkboard because there is .... NO RESERVATIONS.

Hey - is that a bandwagon I see? Yeah, well please scoot over so I can jump right on it. MMMMMM. A tiny space with great big taste - Brenda's Saturday brunch was decadent and decidedly delicious. Smooth, strong coffee, crazily light and flaky biscuits, a scrumptious omelette laden with andouille sausage, cheddar and scallions and last but nowhere near least, lip-smacking grits with enough butter to put the state of Wisconsin into a dairy deficit. Not complaining - I finished every single grit. Is grit a word? Great is a word. Those were great grits. Squeeze had sweet potato pancakes with a rich butter pecan sauce. They were a really luscious treat, but I am more of a savory foods person for breakfast. He liked them well enough but had a minor complaint of not enough butter pecan sauce. C'est la vie. The pancakes and an order of the sugary beignets (three per order) had the glucose contingent well-covered. What a welcome addition to the SF dining scene. Bienvenue Brenda - laissez les bonne temps rouler!

Frickin ridiculous!!  Watermelon ice tea?....A must. Crawfish beignet?...... they'll knock your fuckin socks off!! So minor details.....we waited for almost two hours to be seated.  Ya it was a crazy long time, but the food was great and we got philz coffee down the street and chatted, so it wasn't all that bad. Just don't go when you are ravenously hungry and you should be fine. Their eggs benedict is amazing, super rich...but well worth the intake.  I personally got eggs with bacon, potato hash, and a biscuit.  Very simple no frills, but done amazingly.  And while eating the biscuit, I pretty much had a relationship with the buttery soft fluff....I have recently entered into a monogamous relationship with the biscuit. Worth the wait!

Anticipation and expectations can be dangerous. I went to Disneyland with my parents when I was five. Since I was accustomed to having tea parties with my teddy bears (as well as playing chess with them) I was very excited for the tea cup ride. Well, my mother and I went on the ride but our tea cup did not spin! So while everyone else was getting vertigo from their spinning tea cups, all I got were crushed expectations. Brenda's was similar to the tea cup ride, though I think I held it in even higher esteem. Hearing tell of the lines, I had tried to get up early on the weekends but to no avail. When a client of mine had a settlement hearing at the courthouse, I seized the opportunity to have lunch here. I didn't have to wait long, and my co-worker and I squeezed into the counter seat ready to have my taste buds and diet blown away. I have to give credit to the oyster po'boy; it was pretty good and wellpriced. The jambalaya, however, was more like jambadrya. It was like the chef had thrown in some dessication packets.  It was the saddest jambalaya I've ever tasted. Luckily that was my friend's lunch and not mine. Iced tea was good, not too sweet. Loved the lagniappe of pickled watermelon rind. My tea cup may be half empty, but I do want to try again, perhaps after they finish their expansion to the old laundry next door, and for the esteemed Creole brunch. If there's a inverse relationship between expectations and satisfaction, perhaps there's a positive correlation between time spent waiting in line for brunch and a happy tummy.

On a Saturday morning, we were able to park right in front, walk right in, and get right down to bidness. The staff seated us right away and made us feel right at home. The place was promising and the imperfections were minor and isolated. The coffee was undrinkable. The first fork I pulled out had a dab of dried chocolate on it, undoubtedly from someone's ecstatic encounter with a choco beignet. No matter, the 'ware is in cans on the tables, so the fresh one was at hand. Love that. My crawfish beignets fell short of expectations. Though thoroughly rich and delicious, they were a tad tough and chewy on the outside, just a glitch. Anything with crawfish gets a free pass and a must order rec. from this crank. Then why still the 5 stars? *cue bowchickabowwow music* The plate that followed was utter perfection:  Hangtown Fry with grits and biscuit. The eggs were remarkably light and combined expertly with the bacon, scallions and abundant oysters folded in late enough that the light breading didn't get the slightest bit soggy. All so tender and fresh. The bowl of grits was fluffy and buttery. If there were such a thing as a grits souffle, this would be it. The biscuit was flaky and airy lending balance the bold flavors surrounding it. Brenda's is so good, you'll want to go back to bed and return for another breakfast a few hours later...or maybe it's the oysters that make me want to do that...bowchickabowwow!

To avoid the lines, get to Brenda's at 8am on a rainy weekday. This worked for me yesterday, anyway, when I was the first one in. Pining for grits as I have been, I let myself get persuaded into the shrimp & grits which had waaaay too much cheese for my liking, so should have just stuck with a plain order of gritty goodness. The biscuit was delicious and the coffee the best I've had in a restaurant in a very long time. I wish I had an errand to run in this 'hood EVERY morning, at least until I had a chance to try everything on the menu. I mean have you LOOKED at the pictures?!

Haven't had a good breakfast like that in a while!   ...And the wait wasn't all that bad.  The chalk board list looked like at least an hour wait.  But we were seated in 30!  Woot! Of all the beignets we tried, I liked the cheesy crawfish the most.  So much flavor inside, and I'm not even a fan of crawfish!  For sweet, I'll go with the original.  It was simple, fluffy yet moist, and crisp on the outside.  Goes perfect with their house jam. Took advantage of one of their specials of the day...the Hangtown Fry.  This fried oyster and bacon scramble really hit the spot!  And yes, the best part of this dish was the bacon!  The oysters were plump and also had a strong taste.  Would've been nice to have some crunch in their potato hash, but the flavor was just right.  I should've had their bisquit instead of toast, but oh well....next time.   And yes, there will be a next time!

I had had this place bookmarked for over a year-and-a-half.  I had come across some Yelp reviews and decided this place sounded like heaven on earth.  I was finally back in SFO last week and finally had a chance to go. And, I was disappointed. I went on a weekday morning, and, while it was certainly hopping, I was able to get a table right away.  The place is very small and the tables are so close together, you feel like you are eating with the people next to you.  (Everyone was very nice, though.) I ordered the Egg & Bacon Tartine.  I was enticed by the accompanying Tomato-Bacon Relish -- which seems to top a lot of their breakfast dishes.  But, it was much sweeter than I was expecting and not at all to my liking.  The eggs and bacon were fine, but pretty standard as far as breakfast fare goes.  I thought the grits were bland; I really needed to add salt and hot sauce to bring out their flavor.  My glass of OJ was from concentrate and dull.  (At least it was not served over ice.) Maybe I just did not order the right thing.  The guy at the table next to mine told me the Shrimp & Goat Cheese Omelette is amazing.  But, I was just not feeling it. The service was efficient, if not overly friendly.  But, the servers were running around so much to keep up with the crowd, they just did not have time for unnecessary conversation.  I don't think I've ever seen a place where the wait staff swarms in so quickly to clean a vacated table to turn it over for the next party So, glad I gave it a try.  But, sad my dreams of finding Cajun Nirvana in the Tenderloin did not come to pass.

Forget about the 7x7 "100 Things to Try Before You Die" list because I think I just died and went to heaven. Brenda's French Soul Food just took my soul away with their heavenly assortment of food that is just to die for. (Okay enough with the death phrases.) While I'm on vacation to take care of my two-year old daughter, we went down to San Francisco to take my wife out to lunch on her lunch break. This was a perfect opportunity to try out BFSF and see what everyone has been raving about in Yelp. As we got there we got an immediate parking directly across the restaurant and as we came in they were cleaning off a table and we were immediately seated. Wow no wait, no parking hassle, the Yelp gods must have been watching out for us. Everything was going good. The beverage, made it even better. Before they even brought the food out I was ready to give them a 5 stars just because of the Sweet Watermelon Tea. WOW, that should have been on the "100 Things to Try Before You Die" list. The best thing about it was that it was all you can drink and they just kept filling up my glass. Then we started off with the Beignet Flight, one of each kind since we wanted to try them all. I immediately tried the Crawfish Beignet since I got a Facebook text from Christine A to try the Crawfish. It was SCRUMPTIOUS to say the least and definitely my favorite of the four. For our main entrée we got the following: Me: Fried Shrimp Po-boy (7x7 suggestion) - Fried shrimp with chipotle rémoulade on toasted French roll. 7x7 hit this right on the mark. Délicieux!!! The batter used on the fried shrimp was something I've never tasted before (it could have been from the rémoulade), it was very good and I think it was what made it so good. My wife: Croque Monsieur - Baked ham and Gruyère with bechamel sauce on sliced sourdough. Now that was the best glorified grilled ham and cheese sandwich I ever tasted. It was simple but great, she loved it. Now what makes Brenda's French Soul Food the best joint I've reviewed so far is that the whole meal came out to just a little over $30. I felt like I just had the best gourmet meal in years and it came out to $30? Brenda's French Soul Food I will be a loyal customer "TILL DEATH DO US PART" (last death phrase I promise). TIP: If you get the Beignet Flight eat the Crawfish as an appetizer and save the Plain, Chocolate, and Granny Smith Apple for dessert. $8 for all four.

So overrated. From now on, nothing short of Foie Gras Eggs Benedict with Truffle Hollandaise accompanied by a bottle of Dom and fresh OJ would ever make me endure waiting for two hours in the Tenderloin constantly being approached by crackheads begging for money. At one point I flashed a sneer after being rudely side-busted by pushy agro woman withdrawing. I could literally feel her desire to punch me because I wouldn't give her a dollar. I almost walked over to KFC just to spite her. "You need money for food? Not crack? Well here's a burger then! ENJOY!" Bottom line- if you really want to try this place, learn from my mistake and get your food to go. Inside is smaller than the size of my living room and you might get stuck eating off a ledge against the wall. Unless you live in a cardboard box, I promise you would be much happier eating in the comfort of your own home. The worst part about the whole ordeal was the unimpressive food. I was severely let down with by Catfish Eggs Benedict. Their Cajun Hollandaise sauce was bland and had no kick to it. The biscuits were dry and flaky. The Andouille Omelet smothered in cheese could have been made by any novice at home. I sent back their watermelon tea that made me gag from all the sugar. I can't imagine returning. Ever.

Brenda's is a charming little place, where those of us who prefer our space will have to be prepared to sit in too-close-for-comfort proximity with other patrons. The city set a max occupancy of 40, but I counted only 25 seats in the place that seems ever-crowded, even on a Wednesday at 11am - as it were just four days ago. Service was great.. We were greeted by warm smiles and attentive people who move as quickly as they can, even with the server:guest ratio seeming unbalanced. My sweet watermelon tea (3.5) was good and only semi-sweet - just the way I like it. Their coffee (3.5) was rich, full-bodied, and aromatic. Our first dish was the Beignet Flight (3/5), a sampler of 4 different beignets: the Plain, the Chocolate, the Granny Smith Apple, and the Crawfish. The beignets were a little hard to chew, though the flavor was alright. My dining partner who loves donuts enjoyed the sweet beignets, while I couldn't eat more than a quarter. The crawfish one was the most memorable - extremely tasty though very fishy. Next came our entrees. My friend ordered the dish I had my eye on upon arriving: the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette (4/5) with hash. Unless I'm visiting a place where I've tried most things on the menu and know exactly which I like, I tend to avoid ordering the same dishes my dining partners do.. so I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine (2/5) with grits. My friend's omelette was so delicious I ate half of it, and left my rubbery tartine untouched after tasting a quarter of it. The potato hash were also very well-seasoned and softer than usual - something I prefer when I'm eating potatoes. The grits were fantastic - well-presented delicious mushiness.. but it's likely that if I return, I'll order the hash instead of the grits (because my heart is easily swayed by yummy potatoes) and avoid the Beignets as well as the Egg and Bacon Tartine.

Our table ordered (pics uploaded): - 2 Beignet Flights: Thanks to Yelp for the recommendation! - Eggs Benedict (Chalkboard Special): Molasses ham, creole hollandaise sauce, on one of Brenda's famous biscuits. - Hangtown Fry (Chalkboard Special): Oyster and bacon scramble. - Banana French Toast (Chalkboard Special): w/Ghiradelli chocolate chips, espresso caramel, whipped cream. - Croque Monsieu: Baked ham and Gruyre with bechamel sauce on sliced sourdough. We all sampled each other's plates, and the entire table agreed unanimously:  crawfish beignet was the best of the flight, and the best entree was the eggs benedict, hands down.  The creole hollandaise sauce on the benedict was incredibly flavorful, topping off eggs, molasses ham, and a perfectly made biscuit... absolutely delightful!!  We were all super skeptical about the crawfish beignet, but next time I come back, I'm tempted to just get that as my entree.  Sooo scrumptious!  Definitely a must have! My only complaint is that everything was super super rich tasting, with no sides or garnishes on our plates to balance out the richness.  A little bit of fresh fruit or some sort of creative pairing done by the restaurant would have been excellent.   Tip:  The menu is a little more "Soul Food" (southern food!) than it is "French."

Went here for brunch during SF marathon weekend.  Luckily the wait was minimal for me as my friends that live nearby went early to put their name down and stand in line.  It worked out well as we were seated 5 minutes after I arrived.   Since it was my first time here we decided on the Beignet flight.  (http://static1.px.yelp.c…).  The flight consists of their plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, and crawfish beignets.  My favorite beignet was the molten Ghiradelli chocolate.  Just something about melted chocolate in a pastry that is always the winner for me.   Since I had a marathon to run the next day I went with the healthiest sounding item on their menu which was their Housemade Granola Pancakes.  This consisted of two giant pancakes drizzled with vanilla bean cream and topped with powdered sugar, strawberries, bananas, pineapple, and cantaloupe.  It was pretty good and you can see the bits of granola in the pancake.  (http://static4.px.yelp.c…) Overall the food was excellent and service super friendly.  However, I felt like we were being rushed a little towards the end of our meal. But I don't blame them as there were more people waiting outside when we left then when I first arrived.

I rarely give out five stars, but in this case, it would be a shame for me not give Brenda's the highest rating possible (especially after having yet another one of their heavenly biscuits). I had family visiting from the East Coast over the weekend and wanted her to experience a very "San Francisco" breakfast.  It had to be somewhere really outstanding because 1) she likes breakfast and 2) I wanted her to sample some of the fine eats we have in the City. And to make things interesting, she's a vegetarian. Brenda's did not disappoint. The veggie omelet was awesome: fluffy and filled with tasty veggies. Grits were creamy and flavorful as ever. Biscuit melted with each bite, and the single pancake reminded me why I should never settle for fast food breakfast. I opted for the Benedict with fried catfish.  Oh yeah, it hit the spot and warrants me to return sooner than later.  It also looked so good I'm telling you that I almost convinced the cousin to try some. What really solidified it for me was later that night when she told our friends where we went and each of 'em answered with nodding heads and "Ohhhh." Mind you, these folks have eaten at some noteworthy places in the City and for them to be wowed says Brenda's has to be super extraordinary. Overall, if Brenda's can make the locals drool, imagine how mind blowing of an experience out-of-towners will have.

Brenda, Brenda, Brenda...I was SO excited to try your restaurant and unfortunately I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth. Partly due to the fact that your coffee was awful and partly because your servers treated us like poo. We waited for a good 45 minutes to get seated, which we fully expected. By that time it was around 11:30 and I was starving - I hadn't had anything all morning. Our server came to take our order and aside from telling her I wanted coffee, I wasn't ready. I asked her a few questions and then told her that I needed a few more minutes. I could sense her irritation and impatience with me. She came back with coffee a few minutes later and got my order. After she left we didn't hear from her for over 20 minutes. People who had arrived after us were being served before we were and she didn't ONCE check on us. We tried several times to make eye contact and she would breeze by us every time with not even a tiny glance in our direction. At this point we were both so frustrated that we wanted to get up and leave. It wasn't until I got up out of my seat to get help that they acknowledged us and this is how the conversation went: Server: "Your food will be up in a minute," with a tone of irritation. Me: "That's fine but we hate the coffee, can we get some tea? Nobody has checked on us for like 20 minutes." Server: "Oh, okay. You want tea?" Me: "Yes, we BOTH would like tea." The server came back and brought only one cup of tea. I tell her I asked for two and again, she looks disgruntled. I think they finally sensed that we were really upset and started paying us some attention because after that point, things seemed to go fine. We got our food shortly after and they checked on us a couple times. As far as the food goes, if it weren't for the Chocolate Beignet, there would be nothing noteworthy. I had an omelet with country potato's and a biscuit - nothing to write home about. I could get that same breakfast at a hotel diner and it would be with A LOT less 'tude. Update: To add injury to insult, my dining partner just got a lovely message from the part owner at Brenda's: "Just FYI, I'm the server who served you at Brenda's, and I'm also her partner. Try not to make assumptions about people you don't know.   Have a great day! Libby" That was it - no apology, no sorry for the horrible experience you had. Libby, you don't want a crap review? Provide better service. I hope you feel great now that you've gotten your jab in. You have a very mature approach to criticism.

2.5 stars rounded up. Is all the hype worth the trouble? I'll be getting to that... A common belief about brunch spots is the longer the line, the better the place. I feel that perhaps it's more a combination of how good a place is, how hyped up it is, and how big it is. On the size factor, Brenda's is about as big as my college dorm room, with a maximum capacity of 40 (I counted 11 parties total). Add to that a newcomer's curiosity toward the beignet (which I was taught on my first visit to properly pronounce: "ben-YAY") and you've got a line outside to the courthouses. Arrive any later than 10:15 am, and prepare to have at least 20 folks in front of you. Speaking of waiting outside, the Tendernob already presents enough vile sights and smells... does Brenda's really have to add to that a compost bin on the sidewalk overflowing with rotten french toast and eggshells? Don't know which was more disgusting--that or the pile of feces next to it. But please, though you are a SMALL place Brenda's, you clearly make a lot of waste--time for a larger bin! (Not looking awesome so far, I know.) Once you're finally seated, the servers pay close attention, most likely in efforts to get you in and out swiftly. Now the food here, in my opinion, deserves at least a solid 4. The New Orleans-style cooking offers something unique from everyday fare, and Brenda's story makes it all the more soulful and authentic. A must-order for me is the gumbo, a hearty concoction of okra, chicken and sausage that reminds me of the Portugese Bean Soup I grew up eating in Hawaii. Likewise, the beignets remind me of less fried version of malasadas (http://en.wikipedia.org/…). Again you've got something different with the beignet--the French version of a doughnut offers filled options (chocolate, cinnamon apples, crawfish) as well as the traditional plain topped with powdered sugar. Get the "flight" and you can try them all. They are interesting and good, but nothing to write home about. You've also got typical egg choices here, with lots of andouille sausage, tomatoes, and gruyere cheese. I recommend the egg & bacon tartine, the tasty combo served atop a toasty french roll--it's a fancypants version of the breakfast sandwich but way better. (Oh I wish I didn't have to get back to the bad stuff.) I blame our server yesterday, who may have had a good excuse for being so rude but really I think he was just being a prick. When it came time to figure out how to split our bill between the four of us, two people took out credit cards and the rest was cash. Eyeing our actions, our server passed by and commented, "you know we have a two card maximum." Well, no, we didn't see that written anywhere, but lucky for you that we only HAD two. We even clearly wrote on the bill how much was to go to which card. When he returned with the change, we looked at our receipts and saw that he had screwed up by switching the two credit card amounts. Knowing how busy they were but still hoping the error could be corrected, my friend VERY politely asked if the amounts could be voided and switched. To which our server replied in a sordid tone, "Look, when we're really busy like this, we don't have the time for this kind of thing. I'm sorry, but it would just take me way too long to do that." And that was the end of that. I get that they were busy, but you know what? SO ARE A LOT OF PLACES. And this was the first time in the city I'd ever been scolded for putting more than one type of payment on the same bill. Scolded AND made to believe it was the fault of my friends and me, when it was the server's. Bad move, buddy... a Yelper does not put up with that shit!! Before we were done, I had to get change to pay my friend who had been overcharged on his card back, so I flagged down Mr. Prick and asked flatly, "Are you too BUSY to break my twenty?" Good thing he wasn't, or I swear we would have left NO tip whatsover. I tend to get very upset over experiences of bad service like this, and it's a shame. In answer to my original question, "is this place worth it?", I'd reply: only if YOU'RE not too busy, and only if your SERVER isn't too busy to uh, serve you. Take from it what you will.

First, the verdict: It's over-rated ! Which is not to say it is bad ... at all !!! After waiting for a good 1 hour, a table was made available. I started with a small portion of the Chicken Gumbo which, I am happy to say, was very satisfying to the palate. I followed that up with grits which I must admit, I have never had before but now profess my love for. If this is how grits are made, I am a fan for this was really good! I ordered a stuffed  creole veggie omlette (of which I am not a vociferous fan due to the corns in it). The accompanying biscuits were the best I've ever had, and my vote would go to the preserves as the best partner-in-arms. The omlette was nice but not remarkable enough for me to remember anything about it except that it was huge and I had a tough time finishing it. The accompanying side of hash is not a candidate I'd vote for. I wish wish wish they had a shrimps on grits dish. It looked so delectable on The FoodNetwork. I decided to round out my brunch with some chocolate Beignets; which I promptly decide to pass on the next time around. Call me what you will, but I couldn't care less for the chocolate filled Beignets. Next time, I intend on trying the plain classic beignets as well as maybe try the crawfish (thanks Tamar D; I thought it was catfish) beignets which a  lot of other patrons seem to be raving about --- the proof of the beignets is in the eating.

After +1K reviews it really doesn't matter what I say, so I'll be brief. Yes, it's not cheap, and you won't find many options for people on a diet. My favorite is the Egg and Bacon Tartine dish, love the tomato-bacon relish. In my opinion, this gumbo (chicken, sausage and okra) is much better than Cajun Pacific's version in the Sunset, or Angeline's in Berkeley. But the beef cutlets in the Grillades and Grits dish are slightly tough. Remember to check out the daily specials hand written on a corner of the mirror wall. Something seldom mentioned by other reviews are the table condiments. The brown jar contains homemade mustard. Don't miss the delicious fruit preserves in the white jar (changes weekly) - really good flavor and not too sweet, goes wonderful with the biscuits. I usually choose to come on Sundays for brunch, before 10am, because street parking is free and plentiful. Never had to wait long.

Breakfast all day*, 4 kinds of beignets, and biscuits as delicious as they look in the photo.  These are among the many reasons to visit this new Creole breakfast and lunch restaurant in the Tenderloin. Open for only 7 weeks, Brenda's is already crowded at lunch time.  I would recommend going either early or late if you can - it's first come, first serve, and if it is full, you have to wait on the street.   We started with 2 glasses of the house-made watermelon iced tea.  This is a great drink - cloudy with fruit pulp and tea, and slightly sweetened, with a wedge of watermelon inside.  Free refills, too. Next came the flight of beignets.  If you love beignets, you MUST order this sampler.  We ate them in this order and they were all fantastic:  Plain, Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple, and Crawfish.  I can't even pick a favorite - it's more accurate to say they were all my favorite. My dining companion had the Croque Monsieur (which caused the women at the next table to ask what we were eating), and I had the day's special, the Hangtown Fry.  It was sooooo good - a bowl of buttery grits, a fluffy biscuit, and an omelette made with bacon, fried oysters, and eggs. Since we'd pretty much had our dessert for an appetizer, we just had cafe au lait after our meal.  Don't think that I wasn't thinking about that Granny Smith apple beignet - because I was.  I mean, I am. *Hours are 8am-3pm.

Our second attempt at Brenda's was a success! We arrived on Thursday at 8:45am and there was no wait. It was a peaceful scene, so different than when we tried to dine here on a Sunday at noon. The wait that day was 1-2 hours and we decided we just couldn't do it. I highly advise you to come on a morning during the weekday if you can. We stepped right in and realized why the weekend lines exist. This place is tiny! Don't come here with more than four people. My bf and I sat down and ordered right away. Watermelon Iced Tea - Free refills so drink away! It was refreshing and lightly sweet. I wish coffee shops had this tea option so I could have one everyday! Beignet Flight - Plain, Chocolate, Apple, and Crawfish: I like that they offer a sampler platter but I wasn't too impressive with any of them. They are supposed to be similiar to donuts but they just weren't greasy/fatty enough. I've never tried authentic beignets from New Orleans so I don't know if I just don't like how Brenda's makes them or I don't like them period. Hangtown Fry - Oysters and Bacon Scramble with Potato Hash and Biscuit: This was one of the blackboard specials. I knew coming in that I wanted something with oysters. SO glad this was offered today. The oysters were battered and fried than mixed into a scramble with bacon. The potato hash was great. The biscuit was EVEN BETTER. I think possibly the best biscuit I've ever had. It was flakey, super buttery and just golden. Top it with the homemade peach jam and you have a perfect 10. Grillades and Grits - Beef cutlets in gravy over grits with two eggs and biscuit: My bf ordered this one and I have to say it was just okay. The beef was like a weird meatloaf but the grits and eggs were good. I would definitely come back again as long as it's on a weekday morning. If I can wait at a coffee shop or browse a store nearby that would be a different story but there is really nothing around the TL. I have yet to find anything worthy of standing in line for 1-2 hours. I just can't do it! P.S. It is confirmed that Zazie should definitely be in the mix of the SF brunch battle!

Went here for dinner last night, just around 5PM.  Fortunately, they still had 3 tables open and we didn't need to wait.  I saw the chalkboard near the entrance where people could add their name to the waiting list.  We were very lucky and found street parking just across the street.  It's $3/hour, but free after 6PM.  Bring lots of quarters! The place is very cute on the inside, but cramped.  See the pictures of the rows of tables.  Service was excellent - many people stopped by to make sure the food was to our liking and to keep our drinks full.  My guy ordered the golden catfish with pecan pilaf special.  It seemed a bit pricey at $17, but it came with a large catfish fillet that was well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The pilaf was also delicious and contained celery pieces and crayfish pieces. I got 2 fried chicken thighs, a biscuit, and a side of collard greens.  It is a LOT of food for one girl to eat.  I was full, but kept stuffing myself, because the food was so yummy!  I'm not a big fan of collards, but these were so tender and savory, with pieces of smoky bacon, that I devoured the entire bowl.  The cream biscuit was so flaky and tender, wow, even Paula Deen would be impressed.  The biscuits are large, dense, and filling.  Keep this in mind when placing your order!  It comes with a side of pepper jelly that I couldn't stop eating.  Such a nice blend of sweetness and spiciness!  The chicken was fabulous too.  The crust was nice and crispy, with a little spicy seasoning, and the inside was juicy and cooked all the way through. Eh, I don't think I'd get the watermelon iced tea.  I tried a sip of the guy's, it tasted like sugar water to me.  He really enjoyed it, but I like my tea strong and with more potent flavors, like Snapple or home brewed tea that has been steeped a while in hot water. I'd probably ding them a star if we had to wait a long time.  I'd recommend going early and hungry!

I was impressed by the Yelp reviews and decided to try this place out for lunch. I was warned that the wait times were long, but I only waited about 35 minutes during lunch on a Friday. Not bad. The place is small and seating is a bit cozy, so it's best to arrive before the lunchtime rush hour. By 1pm, there was no wait. We had: - Gumbo cup, $3.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): Savory broth and generous portions of andouille sausage. A great starter. - Shrimp po-boy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): Based on reviews this was the house favorite. And Yelpers, you did not fail me. I love the crispy fried shrimp and the delicious sauce! I only wish I ordered it for myself. I ended up stealing my husband's leftovers. I had total food envy. - Jambalaya & side salad w/ vinaigrette dressing $10 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): I was a bit disappointed. The flavors were not infused throughout so, sadly, the rice was a bit flavorless. Thus, the flavor in this dish came primarily from the meat and peppers. I should've gotten a po-boy. - Watermelon iced tea: Refreshing and crisp. Our server kept our glasses full the entire time. It even has slivers of real watermelon in it. Love this! - Beignet flight, $8 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): If you can't decide on one beignet, why not have them all? Crawfish, chocolate, plain and apple beignets topped off our meal. Let me tell you, the apple beignet was a flaky, little piece of heaven! By far my favorite. The plain one was good, too, although it's prepared differently than the beignets in New Orleans. The crawfish beignet was overpowered by the spices sprinkled on top of the beignet, but the crawfish inside was delicious. The chocolate beignet was a bit too rich and sweet for my taste - but then again, I'm not a chocoholic so I'm probably not the best judge :) Tip: If you plan to order the flight, do so mid-way through your meal as it can take some time to prepare this dish. Total bill: $38. And service was friendly and efficient. Everything was well worth the wait. I'll be back!

Battling SUNDAY BRUNCH *GRIDLOCK* is not usually how I like to spend the first few hours after I drag my tired and slightly hungover behind out of bed.  But the illustrious and elusive Sam Z. had texted me about brunch, and she had previously mentioned "not that expensive" and "beignets" in the same breath, so I couldn't say no.  We waited about an hour to be seated (in the rain) and it did not disappoint.  Come with me on the magical journey that was Brenda's French Soul Food. We got the best seat in the house, in my opinion - the front window seat for three, where you could make the people waiting in line outside absolutely jealous with your food, while still checking out the scene in the room around you.  (Hey, dude outside in the rain, watch me as I eat this fluffy yet crispy beignet lightly topped with powdered sugar.  You're hungry, aren't you?  YES, YOU ARE.) First order of business - coffee.  The Chicory kind.  Dark and bold and bursting with flavor (sounds like a commercial, but I shit you not, it was that good).  A little cream and sugar and I was a happy camper.  Free refills.  I could sit here for hours just to drink coffee.  Really. Next up -  the beignet flight.  (That's right - FLIGHT.)  Holy crap these were delicious!  I am in love with the crawfish beignet, and the Ghirardelli chocolate-filled beignet...well, geez...who needs sex when you have something that amazing?   And then the main show - our brunch entrees.  I had the grillades and grits, served with eggs and a biscuit.  It's a big portion, and the meat was extremely tender and nice and spicy.  The grits were SO freaking good...which is great since my previous experience with grits was not that great.  I ended up taking about half of it home since the portion was enough for two meals.  Sam had the Creole Veggie Omelet with potato hash and biscuit, which was very flavorful, and our other friend had the shrimp omelet, with potato hash and biscuit - another solid selection. A bit of advice for first timers - don't be discouraged by the wait or the brusqueness of the List Nazi, as she is only doing her job!  Basically, if you have the fortitude to wait in line, you will have some wonderful, wonderful food.  Bon apetit!

Well, considering that my order came out wrong--with an ingredient I absolutely despise, I was discouraged from ordering my make-your-own omelet on the menu, and the coffee seemed weak, I think I'm being generous with my rating.  I was not impressed this time.  Too bad.  Best cream biscuits and jam in San Francisco! Still tried to enjoy the breakfast, but I don't know that I'll be back.

Brenda's is pretty damn good but the wait has gotten too long and the waiter sassed us.  I took Stormi here for a birthday brunch and gab session.  We waited for an hour but didn't mind since it's not like Dottie's where you actually have to wait in-line in front of a residential hotel full of exiting junkies.  We just ran over to Peet's on Van Ness and got our coffee-fix while we waited. We were seated politely ordered the beignets, egg benedict, and a shrimp and goat cheese omelet along with two glasses of orange juice.  The OJ was kind of crappy, I'd prefer to pay more for better.  The food was great except for the chocolate beignet (the chocolate wasn't very good) and the seafood beignet (the seafood tasted fishy).  The apple beignet was my favorite.  My shrimp and goat cheese omelet with fresh fruit rocked.  Stormi's eggs benedict was apparently delectable.  As I had my pen over my receipt to give a generous tip, Stormi asked the waiter if he could bus our Peets coffee cups too, to which he responded, "You want me to bus your garbage?" So, one star off and half off of his tip for the sass. (We waited in line for an hour and were polite AND cheery.  Have some respect!)  Four stars for the food.

The two most important words you will hear.  Incoming and Outgoing.  Let me start by saying this place is SMALL, and seats only 40.  I needed to use the restroom, which is WAY beyond the kitchen.  You actually have to PASS through the kitchen to use it, as if you worked there.  I was itching to flip an omelet as it was cooking, but I resisted.  As you pass through TO the restroom, Brenda will shout "INCOMING!", and it gets passed on to the rest of the staff.  (Be careful, it's VERY hot, and cramped, and the floor was slippery).  As you exit, she will yell .... you guessed it ... "OUTGOING!" Seating is very limited, and you will be lucky to get a table for your party of two.  We were not and sat at the counter along the side wall. but considering the extended wait, we decided to just suck it up and sit there. We started the the Ben-yay flight.  (I am going to call them that, since I can't spell it, or say it well.)  The flight had all four ben-yay's ... plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish.  Neither of us care for crawfish, so we passed on that.  I couldn't pick a favorite between the three.  They were all good. I had the Andouille Sausage Omelet, and it was good, but I wish it had more of the star ingredient.  Served with a mildly spicy sauce, it could have used more heat.  I didn't want to ruin it with the Crystal Hot Sauce on the table.  It was good, but I've had better.   The stars of the brunch were the ben-yays and the cream biscuits, with jam.  While Brenda's is very good, it's too much of a wait.

It s official, I have fallen in love! Unfortunately its with a woman, who I have never met, who's restaurant serves the most amazing down home southern food( that I unfortunately)  will only be able to visit seldom! Words cannot describe the amazing ness of Brenda's!! I was taken here as a breakfast birthday treat by my dearest, best yelper friend Daniel L. and there could not have been a better place to have celebrated it then here and with Daniel! I arrived around 8:30 Saturday morning and was immediately struck with an even longer line of eager eaters, than I had imagined. They have a little sign in sheet for you to sign in to wait to be seated, I signed in while I waited for my yelper partner Daniel L. to arrive. Upon waiting, the line increased as well as my appetite. Shortly Daniel arrived and we headed into this small, packed lively place! I felt as though I had stepped right into a small little whole in the wall joint, right in the heart of Louisiana- with the smell of some hearty southern cooked food in the air, the bluesy jazz music playing in the background ,for a moment I forgot I was in San Francisco. I had an idea of a few things I would like to have- after spending the last half hour drooling over there menu. So Daniel and I decided to order a few different items to share. 1st, we ordered there Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelets-With caramelized onions-topped with tomato-bacon relish-This was AMAZING!!! Eggs cooked to a fluffy perfection-with the Goat cheese melted to creamy melt in your mouth wonderfulness ,beautiful camelized onions all drizzled upon with some nice flavorful bacon relish!Oh and it came with hash browns fried to a golden perfection along side with a biscuit the size of my head. 2nd The Banana Foster French Toast- HEAVEN!!! With out a thought- hand s down The Best Damn French Toast I have ever had! How they created this piece of heaven, I'll never know and I don't care.Just imagine Thick slices of soft chewy French toast, drenched in an out of this world, make you want to smack your mama, caramelized sweet rum buttered sauce along with thick slices of bananas drenched in the amazing ness sauce- This about led me into a food coma! Like I said Heaven!! We ordered 2 different types of Beignets- Chocolate filled with molten Ghirardelli Chocolate and the Crawfish-spiced with cayenne.scallions and cheddar Chocolate Beignet was Ok- Texture of bread was little to dry and the chocolate was not present as I had hoped, though still decent. Crawfish Beignet was Fantastic! I was not big on ordering this one, though it completely blew my expectations-Beignet texture was soft and chewy with just the right amount of spices all equaling flavorful wonderfulness (Daniels favorite) This was literally the best breakfast I have had in god knows how long. Amazing food and despite the craziness, the service was great and on top!

Granted that i went to Brenda's a few months ago, I remember the experience like it was yesterday! Yes it was good, veryy good. I met up fellow yelper Marti L for lunch. I purposely skipped breakfast knowing that I was going to eat alot, I just didn't know what i was in for. From what i heard  the wait is usually very long  and they also don't take reservations. Considering how small it is, I can see why. Be sure to sign the waitlist as soon as you get there. It might be small but it has a homely feeling to it, the food is amazing.   Of course i browsed the menu ahead of time to see what was a must get, I saw the Beignets and was getting hungry reading the description of each one. To my luck I could indulge and be able to try every type of Beignet that Brenda's had to offer. http://media1.px.yelpcdn… From the left we have: plain: a traditional french donuts Apple:filled with Granny Smith Apples and cinnamon honey butter Chocolate: filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate Last but not least we have the Crawfish: which is a savory donut filled with crawfish, scallons and cheddar and covered with cayeene peper for a kick. My favorite would have to be the Plain and the Crawfish. Those to two stood out the most for me. The apple tasted like i was eating a mini apple pie and the Chocolate one was ok. Marti and I decide we would share these since we were still going to order other items. What i didn't know was that the flight made both Marti and me very full!! They are yummy but very rich! I also ordered the watermelon tea, which had a sweet taste to it and a subtle taste of watermelon which was quite yummy. The Andouille and Cheddar Omelette  was delicious, packed full of flavors from the sausage, cheddar, mushrooms, scallions. The biscuit was simply heavenly, with its crispy exterior to its soft and fluffy buttery taste inside.Overall I had a very good experience at Brenda's, our waitress was very nice and attentive. I shall return to try more.

I have a thing for super hot asian ladies. They always seem to end up with men who treat them poorly. That is just an observation. But these super hot asian ladies know where to go for brunch on a rainy Sunday morning in SF. It must be instinctive.  Because we waited for 45 minutes to get a table here. If you're with a super hot asian lady waiting for brunch, or one of their admirers, this is the place to be. I am crossing into dangerous territory right now.  The super hot asian ladies in the city are forming a union. It's called DUDES like John T who we hate.  The petition will be on the ballot measure in the next election. The food here is, well, SPECTACULAR. Best early morning meal (I refuse to use the word 'brunch' again) in the city. We shared the beignet combination which was AMAZING.3 gay guys and me sipping AMAZING coffee in the TL In the rain. They're great guys. One of them had to go to the COACH store to buy a bracelet for a friend. Typical. 5 stars.

Sara F's guide to surviving and enjoying your brunch at Brenda's. Step 1. Give yourself a two hour window to enjoy Brenda's. You will need it. Step 2. Walk/bicycle/scooter/bus here with your sweetie but don't drive. Parking can be limited. Step 3. Look out for the crowd of people on Polk St. This is where you are going. Walk towards crowd of people, find clipboard outside of the front door, put your name down, along with the number of people in your group. Step 4. Stay calm. There will be about 16 parties in front of you on that clipboard. This is normal. Do not be alarmed. I repeat, do not be alarmed. Step 5. Look at the menu and figure out what you are getting ahead of time. Make sure your order includes the homemade biscuits and beignets. Other than that, get whatever you want. Step 6. Walk up Polk St to Nob Hill. You will pass a few coffee shops along the way. Stop in and pick up some coffee. You will pass "Out of the Closet". Stop in and do some shopping. You will pass "Good Vibrations". Stop in and buy some toys. The wait will be at least an hour. You have time. Step 7. After enjoying some deliciously saucy shopping along Polk St, walk back to Brenda's, check the clipboard to see where you are at and wait a bit longer, depending on how you timed it. Step 8. They call your name, you are seated. Place your order and wait. Step 9. Enjoy your food while listening to Motown music. Make sure to sing along and have discussions about Nina Simone with your neighbor. Step 10. Leave Brenda's full, happy, satisfied and eager to try out your goodies from Good Vibrations.

I have seen Brenda's in the past and present. If you visited Brenda before 2011, you will have a big surprise. The restaurant is greatly improved. The new dining ambiance is more spacious and comfortable. The dining area has a high ceiling with skylines that brings in natural light during the day. The biggest pluses are that they have more tables, and the tables can be arrange for larger groups. Food speaks for itself. There are already a lot of good reviews that praise its food. I consider this place is a great cheap eat. I would recommend the Beignets, Grillades & Grits and Po'boys. My favorite is the crawfish beignet and the shrimp Po'boy.I honestly have not tried the other Po'boy, but they are next in my list. The crawfish beignet is a great mixture of sweet and salty. Shrimp Po.boy is a crunchy, fried shrimp in a roll that has a little hot kick on the sauce. Finally, I have a couple warnings. First, waiting can be bad, but food is worth it. Second, the smaller your group will lead to faster seating. Ciao, and happy eating.

If I were a total douche bag I would say: The food was delicious here, the service was awesome and the specials were amazing, but I got here at 9:45AM and had to wait an hour for a seat so Brenda's gets 2 freakin stars!   I am not a total douche bag so I will say: I heard Brenda's packs a massive crowd so I planned for a weekday breakfast instead, had to wait 20 minutes for a table but it was worth it....I guess that is what happens when you serve good food right? If I was a total douche bag I would say: The grits were properly seasoned and had flavor, ewww made me want to through up in my mouth because me being a low cal California foodie with zero tolerance for flavor prefer my grits to re-enact unseasoned malt o' meal! I am not a total douche bag so I will say: Best grits ever tasted at any breakfast spot outside of a soul food cookin home.  Buttered and salted just right, not overdone but not health conscious either.   If I were a total douche bag I would say: Brenda's is located in the Tendernob and it smells bad outside with overflowing garbage.  The food was amazing.  Everything we ordered was a solid 4 and above, especially the gumbo!  This is probably the best Creole food I have ever tasted outside of New Orleans, but its location is the pits so 2.5 stars! I am not a total douche bag so I will say: I can tell that this restaurant is located in the Tendernob by the address.  If I hated the Tendernob, I wouldn't come here.  The Gumbo was amazing.  I tasted the Fried Oyster Scramble with trepidation and fear, couldn't see how the fried oysters would stay crispy mixed with the scrambled egg but they did, they were delicious and creative.  Loved every single bite! If I were a total douche bag I would say: I had to wait two hours for a table!  Not worth the wait!  The time before I came here I waited an hour and 45 minutes on a weekday!  The food is good, but the wait isn't worth it.  Once when I came here at lunch there was even a wait.  Crazy!  The food was tasty, but not worth coming back for. I am not a total douche bag so I will say: I will wait repeatedly for this food.  Great place for savory and sweet brunchers alike with specials that appeal to both.  The servers are friendly and ready to describe and recommend dishes upon request.  There is a great selection of specials as well!   Bottom-line: Only a douche bag down rates a restaurant for having a wait, being located in an iffy spot, having small real estate or simply trying to be different amongst all the positive reviews.  If the food is delicious, the place is clean, the service is great, call it for what it is!   Best breakfast spot in San Francisco, hands down.

I'll take your chocolate chip banana bread french toast with caramel sauce and whipped cream and raise you the fluffy, sugar-dusted peach cobbler pancakes with vanilla creme fraiche, Miss Brenda. Sweet lord allmighty.

I was truly impressed by this fantastic restaurant!! I went for Sunday brunch and everything brought to the table was mind-blowingly delicious. I've been in this industry for  16 years, so I'm sort of a tough critic. But, the crew at Brenda's does it right with great speedy service and super cute ambiance...I can't wait to go back!

Dear Yelp review reading person, Please don't go here. We want Brenda and her awesome brunch to ourselves--from the yummy beignets, to the fresh & strong coffee. There's a Mel's Diner up the street which you will absolutely love. Thanks. Love, Matt

Wow, back in 2007 I was one of the first fifty yelpers to write a review for Brenda's. At that time, the tiny diner was one of the hottest businesses then. And with nearly 2,000 reviews, the diner still kicking ass. You want to talk about consistently superiority and still going strong, this is the place.   This morning I came here for my dinner after working a graveyard shift nearby. For most people, breakfast is the first meal of the day. But for the last eighteen months, the typical morning meal has been my dinner. Since the little diner is somewhat empty on a quiet Monday morning and being on my way home, why not? When empty, the Fantastic-4 love to eat here, especially the awesome breakfast and the popular beignets. My now ex-wife and kids would leave happy with sunshine smiles on their faces. Oh, I missed those days! (I'm actually crying. Give me a Kleenex, please) This morning, I had the Grillades and Grits. For $10.50, I get a pair of Beef cutlets smothered in thick gravy. I also get a scoop of buttery grits, scrambled eggs and a moist biscuit. My goodness, this is the perfect meal to end my day. Everything was cooked to perfection. My first time og eating Brenda's popular grits, I was so shocked on how tasty the grits were. Since Monday is my day off, I also added a cup of STRONG coffee for an additional $1.00. I still enjoyed coming here when the diner is empty. Do me a favor; Don't tell my kids that I ate here, PLEASE!

The back of the waitress' blank tank top wrote, "Please eat responsibly." What does that even mean? One can only guess a few things, but let's translate it into a few meaningful things. One, please come early. Being that Brenda's Soul Food is listed on SF's 7x7 list, arrive a bit early. Sign your name on that handy dandy white clipboard in the front, and be patient. This cozy eatery gets pretty darn crowded. Don't worry. The wait is worth it. Second, order the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy. Do not share. Maybe it's the selfish side of me speaking, but you must comply because this dish is absolutely amazing.  Not only is it the 7x7 entrée recommended dish, but all ingredients (especially the nice remoulade) blend together perfectly. The golden fried shrimp is fresh, meaty, & perfectly battered. No need to worry about biting into a hard piece of French bread, each bite is lightly crisp and amazingly soft. Tip: opt for the fries over the coleslaw. The oil they use to fry them is very distinct and quite addictive. Third, try the beignets. The original beignets were my ultimate favorite~ simple, lightly topped w/ powdered sugar, and the batter was so warm and moist. If you are curious about the other beignets, opt for the flight. With the flight option, you can have one of each~ original, crawfish, chocolate, and apple. Fourth, bring quarters for the parking meters (Monday through Saturday). Otherwise, you will help SF w/ their budget by paying a hefty parking ticket. Come prepared. Bottom line: There are ways to eat responsibly, just as the waitress' tank tops suggest. If you follow my four suggestions, you can reap the most out of your experience at Brenda's. It's well worth the wait.

Nice southern food, crawfish beignet was awesome so as hang town fry. Service was good but did a bad job when it came to togo the leftover food. They packed grit and beignet in the same box :(

I've been raving about the shrimp & grits to the bf for months. Today, he finally gave in & let me de-virginize him...with some Brenda's French Soul Food! Even though there was only one name ahead of us on the clipboard, the wait was still 25-30 minutes. We had scanned the menu & specials board while waiting outside, so we knew exactly what we wanted before we were even seated: * watermelon iced tea * beignet flight * shrimp & grits for him (although I ate most of it) * and the fried shrimp po'boy for me ( very generous portion of shrimp, yummy toasted roll, spicy remoulade.) Total: $38 (not including tip.) We walked out with smiles on our faces & bellies full of soul food that the bf commented was as good as the food he's had in New Orleans. Brenda, this won't be the last you see of me because your food is comfort in a bowl.

Ain't nothing tender bout the Tenderloin, except for Brenda's!  This is a cute little spot that serves up some good ole french soul food. I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine with the potatoes and it was really good.  The eggs were fluffy, the bacon was crispy, toast was crunchy but soft on the inside and the potatoes were lightly seasoned to perfection.  I also had the chance to save room for their awesome biscuit.  It's the dry crumbly kind that flakes off when you eat em. So so damn good! I took out one star because I got a $60 parking ticket that day.  Stupid meter maid.

Sat. was gorgeous, so we hopped on his motorcycle and took a ride to Brenda's for brunch.  Arrived around 1p and waited an hour.  Our waiter was super sweet and although it was crowded, he promptly took our order.   -Watermelon iced tea:  bits of watermelon added natural sweetness.  Incredibyly refreshing. -Crawfish beignets:  MUST ordert!  Toasty outside with soft ooeey gooey cheese and crawfish on the inside.  Dusted with a red creole/cajun seasoning.  Served 3 humungo ones. -Eggs benedict with fried catfish served with grits:  WOW!!  Grits were thick w/ right amount of butter.  Poached eggs were perfect on top of fried catfish and homemade biscuit.  Hollandaise sauce was in true GNO style, somewhat spicy with mustard.  My dish, but he loved it. -Oyster and bacon scramble served with potates and a biscuit:  MY FAVE dish of the meal.  WHOLE, HUGE, WONDERFUL oysters blanketed in the eggs.  Oh gosh, if you like oysters, you will love this.  Mmm, drooling, just thinking of it! I tried to order the sweet potato pancakes, but our waiter kindly suggested it might be too much food.  Will definitely try those next time. All in all, food was great, service was stupendous.  Wait can be long, so bring good company and time will fly.  If you're in the mood for some French southern food, GNO style, Brenda's is the spot!

How much did I eat at Brenda's? Well, my meal was 19 hours ago and I'm still too full to finish my breakfast this morning. Brenda doesn't mess around, and this is why I love her. Brenda's has been bookmarked "to try" pretty much since I opened my yelp account, and I finally had an excuse when a friend needed to wow an out of town visitor with some delicious brunch. AND...I got to cross another off of the Big Eat SF List! # 42: Fried-shrimp po'boy at Brenda's French Soul Food The fried shrimp po'boy is only on the weekday lunch menu, but ask an ye shall receive....they had no problem making it during the weekend brunch. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, the sauce was amazing, and the bread was soft and delicious. Among the other things I ate were: *chocolate beignets: SO GOOD!!! The only thing I would add would be some ice cream or whipped cream, but even without, they were perfect. *buttermilk pancakes: super thick and fluffy. The ones I tried were plain, but next time I may get the pancakes with fruit. The ones I saw at other tables looked like heaven. *potato hash: I love potatoes in all forms, but this was probably the best hash I've ever had. *biscuit: these biscuits put pillsbury to shame. I was kind of hoping we'd get a basket of biscuits when we sat down, but I'm glad we didn't b/c I would have just filled up on them alone. *watermelon iced tea: the only thing I didn't love, but I don't really like tea to begin with, so I'm not the best judge on that. My only regret about the meal (and in my entire life as a whole) is not ordering a side of the buttery toasted pecan sauce. The people at the table next to us had some and they were just eating it alone with spoons. I was insanely jealous. Brenda's is officially my new favorite brunch and I can't wait to come back!

One thing I love about this place is that it is an amazing restaurant located in a non-touristy area. Tourists probably would pass over this place due to the location (shady, run down, bums around the corner), but Foodies will flock here. My friend and I (two girls) walked up and down Polk 3x for our 2 hour wait for Brenda's. It's okay that its in the TL and walking here is a bit shady, but it is worth the walk! We ordered the crawfish beignets and eggs benedict. It was definitely worth the wait! I'm flying back to SF in one week... and its the restaurant I want for Sunday brunch!

This was on my list of restaurants I wanted to go to on my short trip to California and it was completely worth it. I went there for dinner only a couple of days after they announced they would be serving dinner, so we got seated immediately. I ordered a watermelon iced tea which was delicious (minus the pulp) and the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) with fries and two biscuits. THE BISCUIT WAS HEAVEN! I'm so glad I ordered two because I would have not shared my one with my friends. I wanted to order a dozen of these to go that's how amazing they were. If you only get one thing at Brenda's get a biscuit. The fried chicken was very flavorful and spicy. The meat was really juicy and tender. The fries complimented the meal well. All three of my friends enjoyed their food with only praise to the chef. I loved everything about my meal and was sad knowing when I left there would be no Brenda's where I loved. This place is a must!

Oh Brenda's, you can do me no wrong, if only you had a location in So-Cal =(. Being in town oh how I just craved me some Brenda's, fortunately for me the line wasn't too bad, about 25 minutes, fair enough for me ! Service is always great, as the waiters/waitresses are super friendly and very helpful, although they're in a bit of a time crunch helping other people, they really do go out of there way to ensure every customer is happy. Gumbo - Ugh, love this gumbo, with chicken, sausage, and okra as the main ingredients and them not being frugal on either of these, I'm in heaven. This is definitely what I've been craving for and no other place has compared besides maybe memphis in costa mesa, but it's still not the same. Flavors are ridiculous good, and it comes out piping hot the way I like it. Crawfish & Andouille Pot Pie - Wow, was this amazingly awesome ! I'm such a huge fan of pot pies and I was not disappointed, the flavors all went very well together and the pie itself was very flakey and moist. Made fresh and piping hot as you break into that crust. I'm not a huge fan of cheese, but it was oozing with it but delicious. They're definitely not shady on there ingredients, including the shrimp. So glad I was able to try this off of there board special. Sloppy Josephine - Brenda's take of a lighter, sassier version of the Joe made with turkey on toasted kaiser roll. My friend really liked this dish, it was flavorful yet still extremely moist being that it was made with turkey. The roll was soft and good, both went very well together. Definitely not shady on the side of fries and they're so good ! Overall experience is great, definitely always a stopper when I'm in town. My friend and I left here very happy & full ! I will be back once I'm in town again !

The BF and I ate sooooo much food while we were here!!!  We had heard a lot of great things about this place, and couldn't wait to check it out for ourselves! We ended up getting the following: - Beignet Flight: one of each of their beignets - Plain, Molten Ghirardelli Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple with Cinnamon Honey Butter, and Crawfish with Cayenne, Scallions and Cheddar. - Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo - Shrimp & Grits - Grillades & Grits You can get the beignet flight if you want to sample all 4. Or you can just order the crawfish beignet & be blown away!  IMO, the plain was too plain, the molten chocolate reminded me of a chocolate pastry and the apple beignet was no different than an apple turnover.  The crawfish beignet was, by far, our favorite - the savory beignets are where it's at!!!  It had so much flavor - you would seriously be doing yourself a disservice by NOT getting it! The chicken, sausage & okra gumbo was DELISH!  We only got a little cup of it to share because we wanted to have enough room for all the other food, but we seriously could have taken down a whole bowl of it!  It was so good! I LOVED the shrimp & grits!  It reminded me so much of the first time I ever had shrimp & grits in Richmond, Virginia!  I've never had shrimp & grits as good as the first time... UNTIL NOW!  Brenda's shrimp & grits is amazing!  The shrimp were plump and juicy, the cheddar grits were fluffy and flavorful, and the tomato-bacon gravy was spicy and oh so yummy! The BF didn't care for the grillades & grits.  He said the beef cutlets were dry and tasteless.  While the gravy was good, it didn't do much to save the beef.  The cheese biscuit was good!   All in all, we were stuffed by the time we walked out of Brenda's.  Be prepared to wait after you write your name on the chalkboard -  this is a popular spot in the 'loin!   We'll definitely be coming back to Brenda's the next time we're down in SF!

There was one thing on my to-do list when I went to SF and it wasn't to see the Golden Gate or grab a clam chowder bread bowl. No, it was to visit Brenda's French Soul Food! Even though I knew I was supposed to attend a very large homecooked brunch in less than an hour, I still begged my friend to drop me off so I could pick up some Crawfish Beignets to-go. Thank God he obliged because they were so effin good!! Luckily I called my order in ahead of time (10 minutes before I got there) cuz there was a huge line out the door and a ton more people inside. I only waited another 2 minutes inside to get my food. Bag of ridiculously hot beignets in hand, I quickly hopped back into the car and without hesitation chowed down on my first ever savory beignet. I only got hot fried dough covered in cajun seasoning in my first bite and already I was in awe at how great it tasted. There was a nice crunch to the outer shell of the beignets and the thick, doughy bread had a nice chewiness that mildly reminded me of the consistency found in mochi. I hit the motherload with my second bite- a rich and savory cheese sauce mixed with bits of crawfish and fresh chopped raw green onions with the heavenly dough. So gooooood. With a mind-blowing beignet like that, I can't help but wonder what the rest of their French Soul food menu is like... hopefully I won't have to wait another year until my next visit to SF so I can try out their other goodies.

If I worked here, I'm pretty sure I'd die of early onset heart disease in about 2 weeks. The absolute best brunch spot in San Francisco. All of Brenda's menu items are ridiculously decadent and scream a big "f*ck you" at your coronary health. Thank goodness, as this city needs help in combating all the healthy-eating hippy-sh*t establishments that are taking over. My personal favorite is the crawfish and cheese beignet. If I had kids, I'm pretty sure I'd trade 2 or 3 of them in for a couple of these things. They're that good. Too bad the place is tiny, so seating on a weekend takes FOREVER. Expect to wait a solid 45 minutes to an hour+ most days. Whatever, crowds and heart disease can't faze me. I'll be outside waiting.

Brenda, Will you Marry Me? No seriously, this woman is a genius! I'm so happy about this place I want to sing!!! The most authetic southern/cajun/french food I've had outside of the South. The biscuits melt in your mouth (I would recommend trying them covered in the cajun gravy YUM) and chicken and okra gumbo is heavenly. Each bite is like a hug :) I have very high standards for beignets, and they don't live up to Cafe Du Monde's, but they are very good regardless (need more powered sugar!) This was well worth my perilous trip through crack land (the tenderloin). And can't wait to go back! ---------------------------------- I went back.. and boy was I happy. So the line is always super long, and I normally don't have 30 minutes to wait at lunch time.. but if you do it's definitely worth it. The watermelon iced tea is AMAZING, really you must try it. To be completely honest I was not really feeling the grillades.. with that being said the eggs (they give you three) and the grits were sooo yum. I must must go back for Saturday/Sunday brunch. LOVE IT!

Brenda's has redeemed themselves in my book. Coming around 1pm on a Monday changed my experience. There was still a short waitlist but we were seated at a good table. I would suggest coming around 2pm as I noticed there were a plentiful of open tables. I had one of their daily specials, the Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast with Berry Compote. It was by far the best french toast I've ever had! The compote was a perfectly sweet topping with cooked blueberries atop 4 diagonally cut pieces of cream cheese stuffed french toast. They should add this onto their regular menu. Also ordered the Beignet Flight and was once again unable to finish all 4 with just one other friend. Read my first review for details on the different beignets.

Things I Could Have Accomplished While Waiting 3 Hours To Have Merely Average Brunch at Brenda's: Listen to Mariah Carey's new holiday CD "Merry Christmas II You" 5 times in a row on repeat (it would be like reenacting the interminable long wait I can only compare to being put on hold by Comcast and listening to holiday music) Temp as a copywriter for Ananda Fuara's cult of Sri Chinmoy's indoctrination brochures (the feverish following and blind devotion of San Franciscans to this place boggles the mind) Cook a completely Thanksgiving meal for me and 10 of my closest friends (it just might have tasted better than the brunch at Brenda's) Walk from the Presidio to Colma (to mourn the loss of a total of 4+ hours of my life gone, forever) Taken 3 Turbo Kickbox classes in a row (to burn off all the carb overloaded calories I consumed at Brenda's) Done a photoshoot with 9 drag queens, natural light and a wind machine (just because)

Played hooky from work on a Friday, and after a nice sleep in, I headed over to Brenda's for the first time! There was still a small line, but nothing crazy. My friend got us Phil's while we waited (amazing, yes). Brenda's is currently remodeling the space to make it much bigger - apparently it use to be really small, and only held a few tables. Now it's larger, and expanding even more - most likely to appease the SF brunch scene (and I am ok with that). On to the food.....so my table got a breakfast "starter" (I highly recommend one at any brunch) from the chalkboard special - Pumpkin Pancakes with vanilla cream cheese and maple syrup.  Not usually a pancake fan, but I would punch someone in the face for anything pumpkin and/or cream cheese related. So yes, we ordered them and they were fantastic. Enough food there to serve a truck driver. After that I got the make you own omelet - it came with a biscuit and grits, and then my friend got the egg+ bacon tartine, which came with a biscuit and the potatoes. Both were amazing and it seriously was enough food for a small army. Also the prices were just right! Each dish was $9 or less too. It was the best way to start a lazy Friday. I will definitely go back and risk the weekend crowd - the food and service was well worth it.

After all the Yelp love that Brenda's French Soul Food gets, I knew I had to come to brunch here. Does Brenda's live up to the hype?  Yes. I tried the Beignet Flight (apple cinnamon, plain, chocolate & crawfish - the Crawfish beignet can be best described as "interesting"... not sure if I'd ever order that again) and the gumbo... which was Yummy (especially with some hot sauce added to it).  But the star of Brenda's is the Jam on the table.  I spread it on the flaky biscuit, I put it on the plain beignet ... damn I bet that stuff could be spread on paper and that would be the Best Damn Paper Evah!  Brenda please let me know when you start to bottle this stuff because I want it on EVERYTHING. FYI: Don't plan on lingering at your table and enjoying a good Food Coma moment while you finish off your coffee after a meal because Brenda's is small and needs to turn tables... so you may be told to vacate the table as my friends and I were told to do after our brunch.

My friends and I came on a weekday at 9 AM and didn't have to wait in line! Yes!! We got seated right away. I had the Watermelon Iced Tea which was super fresh, delicious, and refreshing! I definitely recommend this! My friends and I also shared the Beignet Flight which was a sample of 4 different beignets: original, apple, chocolate, and crawfish. They were all fantastic and had a crunchy exterior with a soft and delicious interior. My favorite was the crawfish! It was the only savory one and it sounds kinda weird to have crawfish in a breakfast beignet but trust me, it was dang good! I also tried the Egg and Bacon Tartine which was not very impressive. I didn't particularly like this one too much. We ordered it with a side of grits which were okay... but I'm not too big of a grits fan in the first place. I also had the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette which was really good! We got it with a side of potatoes and a biscuit. Their biscuits are amazing! especially with their strawberry jam. mmm mmm MMM!! The Granola Pancakes were also delicious! There are actual bits of granola in the batter so it adds a nice texture to the pancake, and you feel healthy eating it at the same time. It came topped with powdered sugar, and fresh fruits such as cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, and bananas. YUM! Brenda's was overall reallyyyy good but Dottie's True Blue Cafe is still my favorite breakfast place!

I have wanted to come here for a long time.  Have posted it on Twitter, and Facebook, and tried to drag the Canadian when he was here (it was raining, and I had heard about the line, so we ditched that idea). After some wonderful news today, I dragged my mother here to celebrate since a certain doctor told me to fatten up.  Not going to happen, lady, but I'll splurge.  I had ogled the menu for some time, so I had an idea of what I wanted. What's good- the food.  While the eggs and bacon were nothing special, the grits were to die for.  And despite the fact that I hail from a state nowhere near the south, I grew up eating grits.  I know the difference between delectable grits and despicable grits.  The biscuit was also yummy, but the beignets were just what I needed today.  We got the apple ones and chocolate ones, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that you get THREE LARGE ones for the price.  Hello! What wasn't as good- some of the service.  For a place that serves comfort food, I expected Southern hospitality.  I only got it from one person...the other waitress didn't seem as warm.  I know you're busy, but seriously, try and work on the attitude.  It will go a long way in an establishment like that.   I'd definitely recommend it for a repeat visit...on a weekday.  I'm not a fan of lines unless I'm at Disneyland.

Is Brenda a real person? Does she work here? If she does, I wanna give her a hug. Thank you for turning a good day into a GREAT day! If the wait here wasn't so ridiculously long all the time due to a mass of famished patrons all trying to squeeze into a diner that seats only 30 at once, I'd come here every morning until I've tried everything on the menu. This place really does live up to the hype. I came here over the weekend only to encounter an 80 minute wait. My starving companions and I decided that we were too hungry and impatient and grabbed brunch at another spot a few blocks down. Determined to cross off another bookmark from my Yelp list today, I trekked on over with my foodie friend of the day after our adventures at Farmer's Market and lo' n' behold....NO LINE! "Hooray!!!" I eagerly shouted as we were promptly seated in less than 10 minutes. I took the liberty to study the online menu beforehand and wasted no time. "Grillades & grits please! Eggs cooked over medium and 2 glasses of sweet watermelon tea!" The iced tea came first and the only word I can use to sum it all up is: REFRESHING. Although I'm not too huge a fan of slurping up pulps of watermelon in my drinks, this was just the perfect treat on a summery day in the city. I was even more excited when our food finally arrived and I became paralyzed by the sight of our beef cutlets swimming in gravy blanketed over a mush of grits. I'm going to have dreams about this tonight... We discovered that mixing the gravy, grits, and raw egg yolk all together created a masterpiece to smother over our biscuits. The kick from the tabasco sauce in the gravy was balanced out perfectly by the grits and yolk. Each bite of this ooey gooey deliciousness struck me with a supernatural sensation that made me repeat "I'm so happy" over and over again. I can't wait to come back for more. If you don't want to wait over an hour to experience such jubilation, visit on a weekday around 1:30pm like we did. If you have no choice but to come out on the weekend and end up mingling with other hungry prospective diners on the sidewalk, you will not be sorry. The wait for Brenda's is totally worth it!

Came here for a Saturday morning brunch with fellow Yelpers Rebecca W (http://rward.yelp.com/), i.ro.ro o (http://io.yelp.com/) and KT Power and will be back faster than you can find an addict in the 'loin! From the watermelon sweet tea (unlike anything you've had before) to the crawfish (or the apple cinnamon or the chocolate or the plain) beignets (can you tell me got the sampler?!?) to the special of the day pancakes I had (bananas foster) I couldn't get enough. And topping it all off I didn't leave bloated or super stuffed. Just the right amount of portions for a pretty descent price. Note: there are only 7 some odd tables and counter seating so expect a long line and nowhere to wait inside... no big deal cause they bus you out as fast as you'll want to come back. Enjoy!

One of my favorite breakfast spots in the city. Early (by early, I mean right when they open between 8am-9am) weekday mornings are ideal to avoid the long lines, but it's still worth the wait if you go during peak hours especially anytime on the weekends. I love their watermelon iced tea - I can drink gallons of it - and their andouille sausage and cheddar omelette or shrimp and grits. I highly recommend opting for their biscuits too. Fluffy deliciousness slathered over with butter and jam. Mmmmmm....I will never get tired of eating here.

This place is the true hidden gem in the Civic Center.  Well, I doubt it's very hidden anymore, especially when you see the crowd waiting outside for a table.  Yes, the place is extremely cramped and small, but that won't affect my rave review.  Not at all!  Plus the service was excellent.  Our waitress was waiting on at least six different tables at once yet she was very attentive and did everything just right. Srsly, the food here is just amazing.  I first ordered the chocolate beignet to start.  Let me tell ya, I thought I was going to get just one but out comes three fat, molten-chocolate filled beignets.  They could have been my breakfast alone.  I was a happy camper already.  I then had the eggs benedict with creole holly sauce, home fries and fried catfish.  Absolument parfait.  That's all I gotta say.  I dare not go into describing their heavenly buttermilk biscuits in fear of wetting my pants. The place definitely attracts a very local and loyal crowd.  Most people seemed to know each other and everyone seemed very pleasant and warm.  This is the kinda place I'd want to eat at every weekend.  It's charming and filled with personality.  I can see why it has a strong loyal  following.

Let's get to it: yes, there is a wait at Brenda's. We were parked outside for no less than 90 minutes on a weekday morn. The procedure is thus: put your name on a list outside and then loiter. If a sketched out homeless man spewing drool and/or hatred from his mouth shuffles by, gently ignore him. Also, pack a few granola bars: the wait is long, and glancing at the posted menu will only stoke your hunger. When we FINALLY made it through the front door it was like winning a soul food lottery. My DC (Dining Companion, thanks Yvonne T for the acronym) already knew what she was getting. But I only look at the menu once I've sat down. (Because I'm the boss.) Maybe it's because I was dizzy with hunger, but I really couldn't figure out what to get. The hangtown fry (oysters, eggs, and bacon scramble) sounded like a disaster waiting to happen. I opted for a burger, slaw and a watermelon ice tea. I hate watermelon so getting the ice tea was wrongheaded and stupid, but the burger was easily one of the best I ever had. Super flavorful, perfectly cooked, my mouth is watering just recalling it. I was non-plussed by the slaw. I ate three bites. Would I linger for 1.5 hours to dine here again? Not really. The wait to wow ratio is a bit high for my liking, but Brenda's isn't bad, and I was impressed by what I ate. Maybe after their expansion is done (our brunch was punctuated with drilling noises and hammering), the line-ups and hype will settle down. Obligatory Title Cryptic: Sue Ellen Mischke actress has strength*. Menu Readability: They have a specials board and centre-aligned one page menu -- just as God intended. Need to mention: Going to the restroom is tough, you have to sneak through the kitchen. Don't do it. What this place teaches me about myself: My wait to wow ratio is about 1.5. Not sure what units that would be. Minutes per Newton? _________ *BRENDA'S Strong

We arrived at 10:20 on a Saturday morning, put my name on the clipboard for 4 people. Waited, waited, waited...we finally were seated at 11:40am. 1 hour and 20 mins? Sigh...breakfast suddenly turned into brunch. Since you have to feed the damn meters on Saturday, I suggest trying to park right in front and not pay the meter until the meter man/lady comes rolling by. Trust me, it'll save you a few dollars since you're going to be waiting for a while. The place has about 8 stools to sit against the wall, 1 3 person table, 4 4 person tables and 1 2 person tables. Of course, they move the tables around depending on the size of your party but I would suggest to go with no more than 4 people. Onto the food! WATERMELON ICED TEA This was mediocre. Everyone raved about it on Yelp but really guys, it's not THAT great. Unlimited refills though so yay for that. Note that watermelon is also a diuretic so limit your consumption... FLIGHT OF BEIGNETS Omg. Omg. Omg. Omg. Heaven on a plate. This came with 4 beignets (which are basically fried donuts filled with stuff): plain, apple, chocolate and CRAWFISH. YEAH, CRAWFISH. No joke! The plain one tasted, well, plain. Apple one tasted like an apple pie but in donut form, and I do believe the chocolate & crawfish ones were THE BEST. The chocolate was really hot (so becareful!) and it tasted of a mixture between nutella and good gooey milk chocolate. The crawfish one is covered in Cayenne pepper so this can get messy. The inside has bits of crawfish surrounded by gooey cheese. YUM. If you're not a donut fan, I would at least recommend to try the CRAWFISH BEIGNETS. SWEET POTATO PANCAKES (served with BUTTER PECAN SYRUP) This was a meal for 1, but we split this between 4 people and it was just perfect. I can't take much sweets for breakfast but this hit the spot. You could definitely taste the yams in the pancakes and the butter pecan syrup made it feel very homemade. There were pieces of pecans in there that was a much needed crunch for the soft spongey pancakes. This definitely reminds me of something Thanksgiving-ish. CATFISH EGGS BENEDICT This is served on their biscuits so everything somewhat crumbles together. I think I would have enjoyed this more had they served it on an english muffin. The catfish is fried nicely and the egg is poached just right, but the biscuit makes it all too mushy. The hash on the side came out to be more of potato chunks which were AMAZING. They definitely did this right. CROQUE MONSIEUR This definitely reminded me of PARIS!! Omg, YUM. For those who don't know what a croque monsieur is, it's pretty much two slices of sourdough bread, filled with ham and gruyere cheese, topped off with more gruyere cheese -- melted and baked to a crisp. Dab a bit of ketchup to each bite and it is absolute HEAVEN. This is served with a side of fries or cole slaw but who needs that when the sandwich is the main attraction. Mmm... HANGTOWN FRY (bacon&oyster scramble) Served with house potatoes. This was pretty tasty. Your ordinary scramble with huge chunks of oysters in them. I don't have much more to say for this. SHRIMP & GRITS I don't recall ever having grits before but the ones served here are way buttery. This dish is definitely uber heavy so have someone to share it with unless you want to be rolled out of Brendas. The grits is topped off with cheese so every bite you get a bit of a cheesey gumbo taste with a spoonful of grits. Despite the 1 hour and 20 min wait, and the disappointing catfish benedict, I would give this place 5 stars. Their food is filling and the service is just right. I'm definitely coming back for some more crawfish beignets and an order of their croque monsieur, maybe two. (Photos uploaded)

I hadn't heard anything about this restaurant... I just knew I was going to be in the area and decided to check what's hot.. Came across this restaurant, saw the pictures and great reviews so I figured this is where I would have lunch. I ordered the crawfish beignets and the shrimp po'boy. To drink I had the watermelon sweet tea. The good.. The watermelon sweet tea is outstanding. Such a great flavor. You can feel the watermelon pulp in your mouth as you drink. Makes me feel like Summer. I could drink that tea every single day, it is that good. The crawfish beignets were good, but the dough itself was a little too thick. The stuffing was a little lacking as well, it was 99% dough and 1% stuffing.  When I think of beignets, I think of Café Du Monde...they left me just a little disappointed. Overall, I would recommend them..because they are quite unique and the taste was good..just not what I was expecting. For one person, 3 are way too much. I took two of them to go.  So they are plenty if you are sharing with someone. The bad.. The shrimp po'boy.  While the bread was great..I didn't care for the remoulade or the shrimp. The flavor of the remoulade was just absent. The shrimp had a very light batter, but didn't stay on the shrimp. The shrimp, even with the batter had no flavor. I didn't even bother to finish the meal. The ugly... I had to suffer through my whole meal sitting next to two girls that had the highest most annoying valley girl pitched voices I have ever heard in Northern California. If I had to guess how many times the word 'like' was used..I would say over 100. One of them complained about her parents the whole time. Her dad apparently lost his job and she has been helping out with money. She was complaining about having to take care of her parents. You are a spoiled brat, and I hope one day you have children.. One of the girls working there, was cleaning the whole time..her shirt was so high it showed her middle and while she was bending over, she had a plumbers ass. Not what I want to see while eating. It won't break my heart if I never get a chance to eat here again.

Pray tell, what possesses normal, well-adjusted individuals to get up at the crack of dawn on a Saturday and stand in line at yet another hip breakfast place?  Why anyone would do that is beyond me. Nevertheless, my sister and I showed up at Brenda's at 7:52 am, 8 minutes before the restaurant was scheduled to open.  A few brunch enthusiasts had already been pacing patiently, waiting for the doors to open.  (Remember the old Mervyn's commercial?  "Open, open, open!"  Actually, does anyone even remember Mervyn's?  Ahh, who cares?)  It was strange that said individuals did not want to form a line.  I guess respecting the age old honor code of "I was here first" was a more mature thing to do. As the doors opened at 8 am sharp, we were immediately seated by the friendly hostess.  To give you a timeline, at 8:02 am half the tables remained unoccupied.  At 8:15 am the place was full.  By 8:30 am, the line was out the door.  The lesson here is simple: early bird gets the table. The place is very small (12 - 15 tables and a few counter seats), and the interior won't win any awards for clever decorations or individuality.  If you choose to use the facilities (I wouldn't), you might have to squeeze in between a couple of cooks and a hot stove.  I mean that literally.  Also, one of the walls is nothing but a giant mirror.  Is that really a good idea, a big mirror in a place where people come wearing their Sunday's worst to stuff their faces with pancakes and sausage? The waitress brought our coffees right away.  Boy, do they know how to make coffee.  If a cup of that strong, almost muddy, coffee doesn't wake you up . . . ask for a refill.  The coffee was really good. I ordered the andouille and cheddar omelet with a side of grits and a piece of wheat toast.  The omelet was huge, and had a unique Cajun piquant flavor to it.  Brenda did not skimp on sausage or cheese, either.  However, the omelet was not the story here.   The grits are the true reason why I gave Brenda's an enthusiastic 5-star rating, and why I cannot wait to go back there.  I love grits, and I order them whenever I can find them.  These were easily the best grits I've had on the West Coast, which is precisely what I told our friendly waitress.  I was already full when I finished the whole bowl of grits, and yet I was sad to see that the grits were gone.  If you've given up on the grits after your unfortunate experiences with instant grits and/or Denny's grits, I would encourage you to give Brenda's grits a try. My sister and I also split an order of granola pancakes.  They came with a dollop of vanilla cream and a generous serving of very fresh fruit.  The granola pancakes were not my thing.  They literally had pieces of granola embedded right into the dough, making the whole pancake hard and unappealing.  You would need a lot of milk to get that pancake to go down.  I had images of a dog licking peanut butter for no reason whatsoever.  I bet those pancakes are really filling though. As we walked back to our car, I kept thinking that if I had shown up later, I would have had to settle for a breakfast burrito at the adjacent Taco Bell.  In my opinion, no breakfast is worth a 45-minute wait.

It wasn't until yesterday that I realized that a life of a foodie/certified pig is very very difficult.  We arrived at 1:15 p.m. with loads of people ahead of us.  Going back to feed the meter twice at $.25 per 5 minutes (1 hr limit), being nearly turned away after a 2 hour "wait" (thanks to our drinking stint at the bar nearby), and finally....so much amazing food but only a limited tummy space to eat them----tough tough life! Cliffs notes: Service- 3 STARS Crawfish Beignet(5 STARS) $6.00 Cup of gumbo (4.5 STARS) $3.50 Catfish eggs benedict (5 STARS) --it was a special, can't remember $$ Grillades and grits (4 STARS) $10.50 Watermelon iced tea (5 STARS) $2.25 Crawfish Beignet was filled with so much flavor.  A donut stuffed with crawfish??? Wow!  BF had the catfish benedict and it was the best he's had.  Don't get me started on the Watermelon tea.  It was the perfect complement to such a flavorful meal as it was light, refreshing, and just enough sweetness. It was even more appreciated when she gave me a cup-to-go, which worked wonders after a night of drinking.  Unless I go New Orleans, I will never think of Soul Food the same way again.

GAWD AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Sure the food may remotely resemble French Soul Food, remotely, hun. My friends and I used to take random trips from Houston to New Orleans and stuff ourselves with all the greatest soul food, straight from the source. I feel at least armed with some experience. Let me tell you what Brenda's French Soul Food lacks. Customer service and pleasant attitude with a Southern hospitality charm. Without the right stuff, the place just does not exude soul food. It is like drinking chimay out of a wine glass, drinking champagne out of a water goblet, eating etouffe without the crawfish, eating beignet without the powder sugar, ... I mean Down Home with the Neely's and Paula's Home Cooking would lose its appeal if they were to talk with a Bostoninan or Yankee accent on their Food Network shows. They are Southern chefs and restaurant proprietors and known for their southern charm that draws in a loyal customer base. If slight resemblance to French soul food and decent prices are all Brenda's has, then I am sorry. It takes a lot to make me lose my appetite or even the irresistable craving for a certain retaurant. Brenda's waitstaff have sucessfully mounted beyond that high threshold. This restaurant may have duped everyone else, including the one hit wonders from the tourists. After a major customer service mishap, that thin thread has popped. My dollars are going elsewhere. I would much rather fly to New Orleans where people know how to run a soul food restaurant right. This place really needs to re-train their staff on what customer service means. I do not care how busy the business is and how stressed out the employees are, because there are plenty of people in that position day-in and day-out but manages to deal with customers in a respectful and logical way. DEAL. FAIL.

Not a huge fan of the location. Got off the Bart at Powell and the walk to Polk Street was pretty frightening even on an early Saturday afternoon. The wait was about 45 minutes for a late weekend lunch which was ok but the restaurant was crowded inside and outside. My boyfriend and I were on like page 4 of their waitlist chalkboard... We ordered craw fish beignets, the shrimp and grits, and hang fry. When the beignets first came out I was like eh...because they were smothered in paprika and they smelled kind of weird and I'm not a huge fan of donuts but after cutting into it and taking a bite it was SO good. It was cheesy and flavorful and you could taste the craw fish. Definitely a must try. But these beignets made me so full even though I only had one and a quarter. They are so rich and I can see why this is called soul food haha. I ordered the shrimp and grits because people raved about it but it was honestly just okay. I felt like it tasted kind of like wine which is strange. I was really full from the beignets so I asked for a box which I proceeded to lose at the apple store later on :( The hang fry was good too. My boyfriend really liked it. It was like a giant omelet filled with oysters and other goodies. The biscuit was warm, buttery, and delicious. I think personally I'm just not a fan of the texture of grits but overall it was good.

I've been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time now and finally had the chance today.  I got to the restaurant at 8:02 am exactly and all the tables were taken so we ended up sitting at the counter which was fine with us!  I  ordered the watermelon iced tea, the chalkboard special eggs benedict with grilled catfish and shared  the flight of beignets with my good friend's son whom I was baby sitting for the weekend. The watermelon iced tea is delicious and absolutely refreshing plus they have free refills which is great!  The beignet flight was well worth the $8.00 though my heart still adores the original flavored beignet I still enjoyed the chocolate filled one. The egg benedict with grilled catfish was delicious although I couldn't finish the hash browns after eating the beignets.  I will so be back.  This place is definitely a must try!

Had a late lunch at Brenda's yesterday.  The hushpuppies - delicious!!  Usually try to stay away from the fried stuff, but a must for me when visiting. My friend had the shrimp and grits, and crawfish beignets,  which she raved about all the way home.  It was her first visit and I am sure not her last. I had the creole veggie omelet with potatoes and biscuit - the eggs were cooked perfectly and taste superb.   Waitstaff friendly and attentive. Thank you for another lovely experience!!

The Visitor's Perspective: For New Yorkers, Brenda's is my "Clinton Street Baking Company" on the West Coast. For all the wonderful San Franciscans I had a chance to meet, Brenda's was an excellent experience. As I write this review, the crawfish beignet is permeating my senses just at the mere thought of one. I owe the experience to two fellow Yelpers (Kyle W. and Alex S.) who were adamant that I check this place out. It was well worth the 70-minute wait on a stormy Sunday afternoon.   The brunch menu was easy to to absorb, and the options were all very intriguing. My ignorance (as a Northeasterner) showed through as I ordered the crawfish beignets along with the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette with a sweet watermelon iced tea. The waitress was about to take the menus, but I quickly responded, "That's only for me!" Was I really supposed to know that an order of beignets comes in 3? My brunch companion chose the French Toast. The egg on the andouille/cheddar omelette was amazingly soft and fluffy. The piquant sauce was a perfect complement. The sausage and mushrooms were juicy and flavorful. At that point, the cheddar wasn't even necessary. The omelette also came with a biscuit and grits. As a personal preference, the grits were too watery and heavy for my liking, but it does taste good. The biscuit was simply perfect - not buttery, soft, and flaky. Can't ask for better! The French Toast (which was loaded with banana slices) with the pecan sauce was pleasantly light for the palate. The sweetness of the sauce was mild enough to consume the taste buds but not overwhelm them or drench the toast. The toast itself was very soft (please pardon excessive overuse of this adjective) and chewy. The beignets were a bit on the doughy side, but the crawfish/cayenne/scallion/cheddar filling was a winner. The fact that it came in a set of three made me full just by staring at them. You can easily clean your palate with the refreshing iced tea, which had a strong brewed taste and a distinguishable hint of watermelon. As I remember all the great tasting food along with the intimate atmosphere and vibrance, I will simply called this THE food experience during my San Francisco orientation. Thanks to those who showed me the light.

I saved Brenda's for a very special occasion, one of the top 3 hungover days of the year - New Years brunch. Nothing like a fried shrimp po boy at 10:30 in the morning to get your day started! The fact that it was even open for New Years brunch was impressive enough. The fact that we walked in at 11 and sat down at an open table was clearly god telling me, "Kelsey, 2010 will be your year." No wonder there is always a line! This restaurant is the size of a hamster cage! Everyone says it's tiny, but to give you an idea, this breakfast hot-spot only has about 8 tables (only 2 or 3 4-tops) and around 6 stools. What they lack in space, they certainly make up in portion sizes. If you want a meal that gives you that slight feeling of guilt at the end, you know, the "Oh my god, I can't believe I just ate ALL of that" feeling? Well, then Brenda's is the place for you!  We started with 3 plain BEIGNETS - light, warm, delicious (especially topped with whatever berry jam they had on the table!). And, for an exceptionally reasonable price, only $4! I could've been done with just eating those, but my stomach was saying "Kelsey, you need to start the new year off right, by stuffing me past capacity and getting rolled out of this restaurant." Game on, stomach. Moving on to the FRIED SHRIMP PO BOY (with a side of coleslaw instead of fries. See, I was trying to exercise some constraint!). It was just done right, exactly what I would expect - crispy shrimp, soft bread with a crunch, and a slightly spicy chipotle remoulade which really made this dish complete. They didn't do anything to make this po boy stand out from other (good) po boys I've had elsewhere, it wasn't "Brenda's take" on a po boy, it was just a solid, delicious dish. And, while I'm neither a fan of grits nor biscuits, my company's GRILLADES AND GRITS was also a solid, exactly-how-it-should-be-done dish. Solid food. Attentive, friendly service. Worth the trek downtown and the wait? No, not really, unless you are a huge fan of soul food and are craving it. Worth trying at least once? Absolutely.

Who knew this gem was but three blocks from my damn house?  Who knew that the wait would be longer than that of Dotties True Blue?  And who knew that a scramble with oysters and bacon would make me stumble stupid? Not I.  Seriously - it sounded so freakin' vile - that naturally, I had to order it.  Having braved the wait in the rain umbrella-less for roughly an hour, I considered ordering something a bit more "safe," like the benedict, but opted to be risky instead.  Imagine: Poultry product, Pork and Seafood goodness all in one dish!  That, coupled with the beignet flight, trough-sized coffee pours and cheesy gritz - I was on cloud nine.  Wait...scratch that, it was cloud eight: (they don't have a liquor license) - what goes with bacon and oysters better than a mimosa or four? I had to focus on my friend John intently, or risk being sucked-in to the ass crack of some woman sitting at the counter - but if that's the worst I have to complain about, I suppose I'm either not that great of a writer, or I have found myself an exceptional new breakfast joint...knee-deep in the tenderloin no less. Oh, and to the homeless, kinda handicapped man who loitered/ pestered me while I was awaiting entry:  I told you I had no cash.  How dare you ask me to go into Taco Bell with my credit card and get cash back for you!!  Maybe if you sold your pimped-up walker you can afford your own damned breakfast.  Just please pull your pants up if you do.  One ass crack is all I can deal with at 10am (especially without a cocktail)

WOW!! This place really lives up to the hype behind it. Although it's a little cramped and you may have to wait 10 or 15 minutes to get seated, the food more than makes up for it in spades. I ordered the crawfish beignets to start and they were flaky, perfectly spiced and just all around delicious. I wanted to go into the back and give Brenda a high five (extra points for the owner and namesake of the restaurant being the one who cooks all the food). After that I had the grillades and grits. The beef was braised in this delicious gravy that went perfect with the grits, both in the flavor and the texture department. I'm stoked to go back to this place and try everything on the menu. With their prices being as reasonable as they are (nothing over 10 dollars) and it being only a block away it shouldn't be to hard either.

Dudeeee...this place was realllllly good. From the outside, it doesn't look like it should be a restaurant...maybe because of the street it's on, but what do I know...I don't live in the city. When we walked in, the restaurant is super airy and clean! It felt refreshing just to be in it. We got seated quickly, and the waitress was decently nice. We ordered the watermelon iced tea - which was super summery and refreshing. Especially with the super greasy food. I ordered shrimp and grits. So good. Like, tonssss of cheese...the grits were nice and creamy. Shrimp were decent size. The flavor was awesome. We also got the crawfish beignets to share. Also reallllly good. Fresh, and nice and crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Would definitely go back when I'm craving some Southern goodness.

Milestone: Brenda's has the distinction of receiving my first five star review in San Francisco.  After four flawless meals, it's time to take off the rating gloves. I've been on weekdays and weekends and while it's fabulous to just walk right in, it's also worth the hour and 45 minute wait.  The hosts are always kind and courteous. Start with the beignets - always!  Order the moment you sit down, since they take a while to come out (and you'll want to give yourself a breather before your meal shows up). The chocolate is wonderful, but the apple beignets hold the deep fried key to my heart. The egg & bacon tartine is phenomenal, with juicy tomato relish and a wonderfully light omelet.  Actually, any of their egg dishes are fabulous.  But I have an especially soft spot for the sweet potato pancakes with that sinfully good pecan sauce.  When it shows up on the specials board, I can't resist.  French toast?  Yup, amazing! Brenda's is expanding their tiny space, which means it can be a bit noisy if the crew is working next door.  But besides this minor annoyance, Brenda's French Soul Food is fabulous in every way.

Went for brunch on a rainy saturday- had a 30 minute wait, which we were expecting (after reading the many reviews on yelp). I'm thinking Brenda should put up an awning or have a bench outside as it is way too small of a space to have people wait inside...and it can get very loud.  Hence- a minus one star.   Now onto the food- it was superb. Exactly what I would want in a brunch place.  Authentic, good quality, flavorful and creative food.  As a table, we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share and sample. We ordered  the beignet flight (love that you can order a flight of beignets.. perfect for my indecisiveness)-  the crawfish one was quite good - never had anything like it.  apple/spice one was gooey and good.. and my favorite was the one filled with semisweet chocolate. sinfully delicious.   Also ordered the pumpkin bread french toast (be warned- this isn't your normal french toast..it's like cake. and it is so good you feel bad eating it plus the pieces are HUGE- good thing this was being shared by 4 people).  Had the veggie creole omelette with grits-n-biscuit and the tartine with potatoes. Both were  well-prepared and rich (this isn't a place you go if you're on a diet).  My favorite was the cup of gumbo-- it was spicy, flavorful and okra-licious.    I also had to try to watermelon ice tea-- it was perfect.   I will go back for the gumbo and beignets for sure.

Brenda's is a tiny place sandwiched inauspiciously between a Taco Bell/KFC and a laundromat in the western cusp of the tenderloin. Who knew they have the best brunch in town? Well, lots of people, apparently, because we waited for an hour to get seated for brunch on Saturday.  It was cold and windy and my friend and I kept looking at each other and saying "this place can't be THAT good, can it?  This wait can't be worth it, can it?" Then we sat down and took our first bites of the gumbo we were sharing to start (gumbo for breakfast?  yeah I didn't think so either, but the waiter talked us into it.)  After one bite of just ONE of the menu items, we both looked at each other and nodded "Totally worth the wait!" We shared the gumbo, shared an order of apple cinnamon bignets, and each had an order of eggs benedict.  We could have shared one order of the bene too--after the gumbo and the bignets and just ONE of their poached eggs--served on their famous biscuts with an amazing smoked ham and smothered in a spicy benedict sauce--we were both stuffed.  But no matter, just box it up for dinner later!   Seriously, I would give Brenda's 7 stars for the food alone.  Then knock off one star for the fact that the place is too small and thus the wait can be really long at times. (Go on a weekday!).  And then another star knocked off for the fact that there was lipstick on my water glass (which was promptly taken care of) and we're still looking at 5 stars.

Hi there! Wait was long. Service was a bit slow (amount of time that took us to get a seat, order and get our food...about an 1.5-2hrs, entire meal was 3hrs) ...I was pretty much starving when I got my food. First came the oysters... my bf and I ordered a Casino Oyster & the Saint Charles. Both were absolutely delicious! The oysters were cooked perfectly and not dried out. The sauce and ingredients made it very tasty but you can still taste the yumminess of the oyster's original flavor. Well done! After we finished our oysters, it was about a good 15-20 minutes before we got out next items. The Onion soup Grantinee came out piping hot... I think I was sold by the thought of cheese in my soup...other than that I was never a big fan of onion soup. Like the many other times that I have tried onion soup...it was a bit too salty for my taste, lacked texture to the soup and wasn't really tasty unless you bit into the cheese that was melted on top of the soup. Also ordered the Crawfish Beignet, the filling was good the dough was also very good but a bit filling because it was just too much dough. But nonetheless good. We also shared the BFC, which was fried chicken with some fries. The fries was a bit disappointing, a bit dried and seems like it lacked freshness. It really was just something for the Fried Chicken pieces to sit on & soak up oil. The chicken was pretty good. Crispy outside, juicy and tender on the inside. The meat pretty much fell off the bones once you bite into it. Seasoning was simple, light and tasty. My bf got the watermelon-iced tea, didn't think it was anything special. I'd rather get lemonade. I thought it would have tasted better if it were a bit more chilled. Some sides that came with the pickled watermelon, that was good, I like pickled food and this one was sweet and salty. I like. Coleslaw-ish thing was good, had a light coleslaw taste and it didn't feel like I was eating cabbage with mayo. Over all good food, great price, Oysters were my favorite. Would want to come back and try the sample oyster dish and some of the other items. Note to self (and Yelpers): Come early, sign your self up on the chalk board...take a stride around the area and come back in an hour or so...They do not take reservations... and the place is small. Casual & cozy. Oh! Their brunch is supposed to be really good...definitely want to come back for brunch!

I wanted to love this place. Really. I've lived in the neighborhood for years and I'm getting a little bored of my regular haunts. Also, I really love N.O. style cooking. Perhaps I was there on an off day... We put our names on the list and waited outside about 15 minutes before we were called to be seated. I expected that. The place is small and they were busy for lunch. When our name was called, we approached the door, and the server crossed our names off the list. As we walked in, he told us the table wasn't actually ready yet and told us to go back outside. We waited another 10 minutes or so and a different server came out to call diners to the table. We explained we were next as the previous server crossed us off without seating us. She asked in an accusatory tone if we were actually there when he called us. Um. Yeah, we were there. Once seated, we were able to place our order right away. Since my dining companion and I hadn't seen each other we were busy chatting away. I realized that I finished my drink and we still didn't have any food. I also noticed that tables seated moments before us were starting to turn over. Plus, I was really, really hungry. The service: We had to ask about our food because there was such a long delay--then it was delivered immediately. Coincidence? Or was it just sitting under heat lamps waiting to be served? I had to ask for a glass of water twice.  My dining companion had to ask for her coffee twice (note this was after they brought mine). The server "forgot" they were out of crayfish and came back several minutes after our order was placed to inform us, so we need to make changes to our order. Tables turned over two and three times before we were finally ready to get out of there. Final Piece de resistance--the bill was calculated incorrectly. Gah. The food: I got the special Shrimp Pot Pie. It was topped with a cheddar biscuit that was amazing cheddary goodness. I couldn't wait until I could take my next spoonful of the pot pie innards. Talk about disappointing. The shrimp must have been older than God. It was tough as leathah. The sauce had a good flavor and considering I waited so long for my meal and was ready to gnaw on my own hand for nourishment, I gobbled it down. I ordered the chocolate beignets for dessert, expecting that they would be the restaurants saving grace. Again, with the tough as leathah. The chocolate innards were divine though. You can't go wrong with Ghirardelli. I also ordered food to go to bring home to the husband. He wanted the Sloppy Josephine, fries and the granny smith apple beignets. One bite in to his sandwich, and he flipped out about how great it tasted. I just had to have a bite, and you know what, he was right! Wait, what's that I hear? My husband freaking out about how awesome his beignet is? Yeah, he shared it with me and it was awesome. His beignets were cooked to perfection. It's almost like our meals came from two different restaurants. Because my in house food and my husband's to go food were polar opposites, I'm willing to give the place another try. Next time, I'll stick with the specialties, and avoid the "specials." -------- Oh, and I forgot about the towel. How could I possibly forget to write about the towel? I watched the server seat people while clutching the most vile looking piece of fabric I've seen in years. I thought maybe it was used to wipe off white boards or clean gas station bathrooms because it was so dirty looking. I mentioned to my friend that I hope he wasn't using it to wipe down tables. Moments latter, and in utter horror, I watched as he cleared a table and wiped it down with that horrid rag. We didn't touch the table during our meal, nor set our silverware on it. Criminy! The restaurant does a brisk business. You'd think they could stay well stocked with clean linens, but then it is in the Tenderloin. Gotta keep it real, I suppose.

The reviews of Brenda's says it all...you must go to try the breakfast and lunch...two visits.  Don't go if you are in a hurry, because you will have to wait outside so let it be a part of the experience. I posted a few photos of our wait outside and brunch. I'll go back to check out the lunch items and a few of the beignets too!

We got there around 9:30am (probably a record for us) so we were seated almost immediately. That was probably the high point of the meal. We had the Beignet selection (Chocolate, Apple, regular and Creole) along with the Shrimp and Grits. Having never eaten Beignets in New Orleans I don't have that to compare them too, but honestly it was like eating dense bread with a hint of apple/chocolate. Not impressed. The Grits were pretty good for the first few bites, but then you realize you like it because it's loaded with butter. The Shrimp and the sauce it was in was pretty damn good, but the dish as a whole was just way too rich due to the butter. Yes, French food is rich and they're not afraid to use butter. However, good French restaurants know how not to cross the line between flavor and a heart-attack.

3.5 stars. The wait was an hour long on a late Saturday morning.  I had come here to cross the fried shrimp po'boy off the Big Eats list.  It's not on the weekend brunch menu, but I was able to order it.  Bf got the croque monsieur and we shared an order of crayfish beignets. My favorite of the three were definitely the crayfish beignets.  I don't agree with the other reviewers that the filling was too salty; I thought it was just right and it was delicious.  There wasn't a lot of crayfish, but there was definitely a ton of flavor. I just wish they could've been more generous on the filling. The po'boy was definitely pretty annoying to eat.  The shrimp kept falling out and it was difficult to find how to hold it *just* right.  After I got the hang of it, it proved to be an OK sandwich.  It was small but filling especially after the beignets. Oddly enough, the bf thought the crayfish beignets were a little cheesy but enjoyed the croque monsieur.  I had one bite of the croque monsieur and I know I wouldn't have been able to finish even half of that.  *Too* cheesy. The watermelon iced tea is really good - not too sweet.  Bf said his coffee was bad. The restaurant is really small and cramped.  I was seated elbow to elbow with the lady who was giving me the stink eye during my wait outside for no reason.  Maybe because we were parked right in front of the restaurant and waited in the warm car and didn't pay the meter during the hour wait.

Favorites: Grillades and Grits, Oyster Po' boy, and Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea. We arrived around 10 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning and there was STILL a line. Guess that means something in terms of how good the food is. The space is a bit cramped but they seem to have the layout and the seating process down to a tee so the wait isn't very long most of the time. The Grillades and Grits is my favorite item on their menu. Two slices of round steak slow cooked in a  piquant gravy served on top of rich and creamy grits with over easy eggs and buttered sourdough toast to dip into the yolks... This meal will definitely tide you over throughout the entire day. Add a glass of sweet watermelon iced tea and you're good. The Oyster Po'boy is also delicious. The oysters are coated in cornmeal and fried to perfection then sandwiched between a French roll slathered with chipotle rémoulade. Heavenly and possibly the best Po'boy this side of Louisiana.

You definitely cannot go wrong with having brunch on a Sunday afternoon--especially at Brenda's French Soul Food. "Brenda", whoever this awesome lady is, sure taught me quite a bit about about Soul Food in just one brunch sitting: 1. Fried oyster and bacon in your eggs makes for one mean brunch dish! 2. Mr. Pillsbury dough boy does not make the best biscuits. So far, Brenda does! 3. Grits is not gruel deep fried in lard (hahahaha). It's actually more like a corn-based porridge which is suppose to be bland. Brenda makes even a bland dish like grits oh so delicious! "Brenda"...I just have one thing to say to you: Thank you for making my Sunday that much more awesome!

Came to Brenda's to try out #42 from the 7x7 Big Eat list - fried shrimp po boy... Patricia P was nice enough to wait outside for an hour before the rest of our party arrived. THANK YOU! We then probably had to wait for another  1/2 an hour totaling an entire wait of about 1.5 hours.  I started to get pretty ravenous by the time we were let inside and taken to our table. We all started off with the chocolate beignets, which were sooooo yummy and delightful.  I later heard there was a trio platter, which I would prefer getting next time.  One of my friends ordered the pancakes, which looked like the biggest, fluffiest, tastiest pancakes ever...Another one ordered the shrimp and goat cheese omelet, which also looked like it was to die for.  I ordered the fried shrimp po boy, which was awesome.  The sauce on it was delightful and they weren't cheap with their shrimp.  It was super hard to eat and messy, but delicious.  The fries were ok - I wished they would've been crispier.   I sat and contemplated between this item and the Egg and Bacon Tartine, which came with bacon, eggs, gruyere, and a tomato bacon relish on a toasted French roll with hash. OMG, I still want it. I can't wait to come back and order that so I can change my four star review to a five! I have a feeling this is more of a brunch place instead of a lunch place

I swear I almost lost fingers waiting for almost two hours in the bitter cold for Brenda's.  They were totally dead numb by the time we worked our way down two pages of list to our name and got inside this tiny little Tenderloin cafe. Once inside, they got a cup of steaming hot coffee in my hands, I placed my order (when you've got hours of wait time, you basically know what you want by the time you get in), and the food started to roll out, and I was fine.  Better than fine, actually.   The food is excellent.  Since by this point we were eating breakfast at 12:30, we decided to go all out.  We started with a beignet mixed plate.  I surprised myself by liking the savory, crawfish beignet best.  The sweet ones were the crowd pleasers though--particularly the chocolate.  I loved my main course; the catfish eggs benedict.  Instead of some flimsy english muffin, the benedict is served on one of their super fluffy, buttery biscuits.  My husband's Andouille omelet was excellent as well--good egg to stuffing ratio.  And the side hash and grits that came along with our food were perfectly done as well.   The only downside (besides the wait) was our waitress, who was efficient but crabby.  With the way they turn around tables their staff is making bank on tips.  I'd try and be a bit more perky for that much money.

Brenda's is awesome, maybe too awesome? By the time we left I felt like a stuffed pinata waiting to explode. The interior is a comfortable little dining hall that can seat about 40-50 people. Luckily there's a clipboard outside for wait list signups. Fortunately we got the last table and not the somewhat cramp looking counter. I liked the very casual feel of this place as well as our friendly waitress. The menu is very enticing. It's a good selection of sweet or savory dishes, mostly the latter, this is a soul food restaurant after all. I immediately knew that we were getting the Beignet Flight. The Beignet Flight is is a sampling of all their beignets. The beignets come on a rectangular plate with four different flavors: crawfish, chocolate, apple, and plain. I was relieved to discover that none of them were bad. I think that the crawfish beignet had the most surprisingly good flavor while the others were predictable, although still really really good. These beignets are comparable to the ones in Louisiana except for the original spin of different fillings. If I came again I'd probably just get the Beignet Flight again. I like them all. For breakfast my friends ordered the Grillades and Grits while I had the Andouille Sausage and Cheddar Omelette. All of our dishes looked great. They also have a delicious homemade strawberry jam for your biscuit. I could seriously eat the jam by itself. My friends also got the watermelon ice tea, they said it was good. What's funny is that they give a dish of butter on your plate. This is totally unnecessary because the food is f*&$ing filling. If you don't already get full off of the beignets or starters, the biscuit alone will fill you up. The grits are incredibly creamy and buttery. My omelette was great but very rich. I was very pleased with everything but I advise coming on a very very empty stomach and not over doing the starters unless you plan on taking stuff to go. Brenda's does not skimp on anything. I tried eating my leftovers later in the day and I couldn't even finish it in one sitting! hahaha. ____ I can't find any fault with Brenda's. I'll be definitely coming back. It felt like I was transported back to Louisiana. Be sure to wear stretchy pants.

4.5 stars.  Fried catfish eggs benedict.  The catfish was perfectly seasoned and the spicy hollandaise was lighter than I expected.  The egg was a little overcooked but still good.  It makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I also tried the granola pancake.  It was delicious but incredibly dense so eating a whole order might be difficult. The place is very small so since you will definitely hear what everyone around you is saying, you might want to wait on sharing your deepest, darkest secrets.  They open at 8am for brunch which was great since I was up early but no one else seemed to be.

After only one visit this place has shot to the top of my favorite brunch places in SF. I had high expectations since I had read some great reviews about this place and was expecting a long wait, trust me folks the wait is worth it. The food here is simply divine and I highly recommend starting with the Beignet sampler, they are so good and perfect way to start your experience. I didn't go with any of their specials, probably a mistake on my part but instead I ordered a custom omelette... now I know that sounds boring but my God I wish my homemade omelettes turned out so good. In recent times I've been turning into a bit of a coffee snob and this place gets top marks in that category. I need to ask them next time what coffee they brew. I'll be back for sure. I'm actually bummed that as I write this they're closed for the day since I'd love to swing by right now. Oh well, I'll have to wait till tomorrow morning...

I went in with sky-high expectations - I had been wanting to try this place since it was Hot on Yelp.  And almost a year later, I finally sucked it up for the 30 minute wait for a counter seat for 2.   It was great, but not amazing.  Still a solid four stars. The place is teensy.  But the portions definitely aren't - they will pack a artery-cloggin, caloric punch.  We had the plain beignets, to start which I didn't find all too impressive - a little chewy, and not at all like the ones in New Orleans.  Will have to try the apple ones next time that everyone is raving about. For my main, I had the eggs benedict which came on biscuits instead of english muffins.  Now THAT'S the way you gotta do it!  Had it with a grits on the side which were this rich, creamy mass of butter and goodness.  I only made it through half my plate, so  I recommend sharing a savory dish and perhaps the french toast - yum!

I was totally psyched to try Brenda's after a friend's enthusiastic recommendation and after reading all the gushing reviews posted here.  After waiting an hour and a half to get in and another forty five minutes for our food, I was sitting in my own damp puddle of anticipation (I mean drool, not the other thing.  Although since I'd had two cups of coffee and was reluctant to squeeze by Brenda and crew to get to the bathroom, the other thing wouldn't have been outside the realm of possibility).   So why was I, after fifteen minutes of voracious eating, leaving so deeply disillusioned? My corned been hash (special) was totally not what I expected.  The corned beef wasn't the squarish bits of meat you usually find in hash but rather sandwich-like slices torn into bite sized pieces.  The chunks of potato were too large and way too numerous.  And the whole thing was very spicy, unlike any hash I've had before.  I ordered the eggs scrambled and instead of preparing them with curds, they were in an overcooked folded sheet, something like a really bad omelette. The beignets that I've read so much about were tough and dry- a chore to eat.     I did like my biscuit.  So much so that I spent the rest of the day and the one after shouting BIZ-KIT! at Boyfriend, hoping he'd get the message and magically teleport one to my tv table.  Boyfriend liked his gumbo and catfish po-boy (also special) but agreed with me 'bout the beignets. I'm going to give it another try because I trust the Yelpers who loved Brenda's.  And I really love BIZ-KITS!

I wondered why we waited outside for over an hour getting heckled by an aggressive homeless dude.  4 girls, middle of the TL.  (At least it was nice out...?) Then I understood as soon as I bit into the crawfish beignet.  As I sunk my teeth into this fresh, warm morsel and tried cheesy grits for the first time with the bacon tartine, I knew I had found the southern Fat Kid Heaven. Relatively speaking, I think I would rate Farmerbrown's Little Skillet a bit higher as far as texture of food (bacon was not very crispy...maybe that's the style?) and safer as far as not getting accosted by a homeless person (a server actually had to call the cops on him for harassing customers!), but damn, those beignets.  NOM!

Saturday Brunch and Auntie wanted to come here. YAY!! I have been meaning to try this place forever!! Got there at 10:30 and didn't get seated 'til 11:30. $3/hr for street parking is a pain in the butt!! Walked in and realized how SMALL the place is!! (Hence the horrendous wait.) We got seated at the bar seating. Ordered the beignet flight for myself since I wanted to be a piggie. My mom, sis, and aunt had an order of the Crawfish ones. I heard so many good things about the Crawfish beignets and overall I was disppointed :( TOO SALTY. There was a LOT of breading on all the beignets which made them heavy and not light and fluffy (like a doughnut). My fave one was the Chocolate one. Molten chocolate heaven! Mom also ordered the Gumbo- it has a great smoky flavor. Entrees ordered were the shrimp and grits, hangtown fry, and the catfish eggs benedict. Cat fish benedict was yumm. Catfish was flavorful. Eggs perfectly poached. LOVED the hollandaise sauce. The biscuit underneath was a nice touch- though it made the dish super heavy. The potatoes were ok. I like a more crispier potato rather than mushy. Hangtown hash was good. Lots of fried oysters and bacon inside. Shrimp and grits was my fave. LOTS of cheese, bacon, and shrimp inside! Heartattack!! :D Overall, it was a pretty decent Brunch place. The wait for this place made my expectations higher thus I am giving it 3 stars. A OK!! Try it out if you are near City Hall!!

Enthusiastic local: Are you guys visiting? How did you find this place? Me: My friends are visiting but I recently moved up to the Bay Area. And I found this on Yelp! :) So when my college friend came last weekend for a work conference and staying at the Fairmont Hotel, apparently my brilliant suggestion was to walk to the nicer part of Nob Hill to the Tenderloin for brunch. Walking down Larkin St, I couldn't find the place between Eddy and Turk until we went into a liquor store for directions. "It's a block from here on POLK ST where there a long line" OH. So the long line for us actually went on from 12:50pm to 1:40pm (they close at 3 on weekends). Delicious! My friend and I got the Hangtown fried eggs with oysters with side of potatoes and biscuit for $10! That's right...plenty of oysters for $10. Also good call was the watermelon house tea with free refills. :) Too bad I was already full but I've heard the gumbo and beignet are excellent too. Definitely will be a next time!

This place is dangerous...dangerously GOOD (SO CORNY BUT TRUE)...and you have to be careful because on you go Brenda, any other breakfast place will just seem like some soggy hash browns from McDonalds on a gloomy Sunday morning. And trust me...just try the Crawfish Beignets...they speak for themselves as to how good they are. I swear you will dream beignets for 2 nights and on the 3rd...you will come back to Brenda. The only negative is the wait as it is such a popular place (but the seating is limited).

One of my new favorite brunch spots.  For sheezy. I showed up early on a Saturday (like realll early), so I only had to wait about 5 mintues.  I have heard the wait can be long sometimes - but I would have glady had waited.  So worth it. I had the Eggs Benedict, which came on a biscuit rather than an english muffin. Yum.  The spicy cajun hollandaise was also deliciousoso.   The staff were all cute, happy and friendly and I could even see Brenda herself cooking in the back.   EVERTYHING looked amazing and I am definitely coming back.  I'm already thinking about when...

Brenda's.... What can I say?  Faves and I have been trying to go out here for a while now but never really made the effort to go there.  I don't know why but I'm glad we finally did! Located around the corner from Bambuddah lounge, lil spot next to the KFC that was a lil hard to find.  We got there at about 7:50am and there were 2 pairs of people ahead of us. Upon being seated, I ordered the watermelon iced tea and man that was on it! What makes it even better is that there are FREE refills too! We ordered the undecided portion of their Beignets which included the following: plain, granny apple smith, chocolate and crawfish.  All of them had their own unique flavor and textures but I ultimately loved the Crawfish Beignet!  A lil spice to it with the creaminess and delicate flavor of the crawfish was unbelievable.   For our breakfast plates: I ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelet and faves ordered a Shrimp Po'Boy, don't ask me why. hahahaaaa  My breakfast plate also came with a bowl of grits and a biscuit.   I honestly can't describe how wonderful and fulfilling my breakfast was.  The grits were definitely a hit.  After having theirs, I will no longer go to that one spot in Oakland (Jack London Square area), I can't even remember that place's name.  Anyways, my omelet was nice and creamy due to the goat cheese filling that included a generous portion of shrimps.  The biscuit was surprisingly good and had that "melt in your mouth" texture.  I'm pretty sure it a good amount of butter in it but hey, there is nothing wrong with that!  The only thing I wouldn't praise about is the amount of sautéed onions they put inside the omelet, pass on that!  My faves had only a few bites of her Po'boy as she couldn't finish it.  The sandwich itself was huge and the amount of fries they give was nuts! I will definitely come back to this place, so far this is my 2nd favorite breakfast/brunch spot underneath Brown Sugar Kitchen.

After a long wait, we finally managed to visit Brenda's new space for dinner. We'd only ever had the amazing brunch before. We left loving the food and not loving the service. We were seated pretty quickly as it was later in the evening (after 8) and there was a very short line. Yay! Once we were seated, we ordered pretty quickly. And waited. And waited. And waited. To be fair, there was a very large party of 10 who were waiting for their food and the kitchen is still relatively small. I didn't mind waiting as much as the complete inattention by our waitress. She didn't come over and say "hey I know it's been a while, this large party is still waiting for their food." Nothing. Our appetizers were pretty simple, and one was just a cup of soup, which presumably is pre-made, right?  Still, waiting a half hour for appetizers is pretty bad, no matter who is in front of you, especially when you're very hungry. So on to the food. We had hush puppies and gumbo to start and both were nice. Hush puppies were light and not greasy, but the gumbo could've had a little more punch to it, a bit of salt and some hot sauce fixed that. The main courses were fantastic. I had meat loaf which was moist and tender and had a nice crusty top on it, along with mashed potatoes and nicely cooked green beans. Hubby had amazing fried chicken. Really good. Both a tiny bit sweet and a bit hot, it was really nice. I didn't try the collards since I don't care for them, but hubby liked them too. So just take care of the inattentive service (which has not been the case when it was more crowded in the former, smaller space at brunch!) and you've got a winner here.

Taco Bell never had such a long mob outside their door!  Too bad it's all for Brenda's!   We did the expected 40+ minutes wait on a Saturday afternoon, but the pace of the turnover wasn't too awful.  Seemingly a wait staff kinda peeps out enough times to assure yourself "Oh, I think we're getting closer!!!"  It also felt oddly nice to have so many other people waiting outside repeating "Man, I'm so hungry!  I can taste those beignets already!" Well, we did end up getting the beignet flight and quite honestly just stick with the crawfish beignet.  While the others are great, they sure aint anything special.  The crawfish filling though is creamy, cheesy, and all things delicious!  Definitely wish they sold these right ouf of my own kitchen. We each got a Po' Boy -- mine being the oyster, and friend got the shrimp variety.  I am not a fan of oysters unless they're cooked.  Something about it looking like a boogerish private part kinda turns me off.  But if you coat it in cornmeal and fry it up, yeah give me some of that.  It came out very well seasoned with a great crunchy consistency.  The oyster wasn't fried off beyond all moisture so it wasn't like eating potato skins.  The cole slaw it came with was crunchy and a nice accompaniment with all the fried goodness... not to mayo-ey nor vinegar-ey (gosh, I love saying those words!) And another surprise hit -- the coffee!  Smooth and never ending!  One that didn't really need my usual 2 heeps of sugar.  The waitstaff, being the attentive folks they are, kept refilling every liquid vessel we had on the table.  Watermelon iced tea was also very refreshing... except it was really straight up watermelon juice.  I still aint complaining! Cute set up they have here and love that it is so cozy and charming.  It could really dbl its profits in a better neighborhood or a bigger location, but I bet it would decrease the likability of the restaurant.  Planning on making it a favorite of the city.  Only con... $0.25/6 min on all surrounding meters!

Could I have a new favorite brunch spot? ...probably not, but Brenda's is near the top of the list. I've been meaning to try it for ages and made an attempt a couple of weekends ago. Sadly, they were closed for a week (!!), but I finally went last weekend. My friend and I arrived at a little past 10 on a Saturday morning which I would consider a decent time to get to brunch - hopefully, getting there before the hangover crowd. We were indifferent to a table or the counter, and we waited for 30-40 minutes. The place is pretty small, so I wouldn't advise coming with a group larger than four. It's a painful wait since Polk St felt like a wind tunnel, but there also aren't many places close by to grab a coffee to keep your hands warm. When my name was called, it was like winning the lottery. We decided to get the traditional beignets to begin, and I ordered the grillades and grits (while my friend got the fried catfish po' boy). I'm not a sweets person but I enjoy beignets every now and then; I thought the beignets were good, but my opinion of beignets may be ruined by my memory of the most amazing beignets in New Orleans...which may just be my memory playing tricks on me. But the real winner was my main:  grillades, I learned, are beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy. These grillades came with grits, choice of bread (biscuit) and eggs (scrambled). The beef cutlets were so tender that I could eat them with just a fork (probably even a spoon), and it was the right balance of rich and spicy which was also perfectly offset by the creamy (but not too rich) grits. And the biscuit? Oh yeah, flaky and moist. The restaurant is a bit cramped (oh well). Prices are good - none of this exorbitantly priced breakfast stuff. Parking in the neighborhood is tough - there's lots of it, but we were only able to find meters with 1 hr parking limits in the area. Come with lots of quarters since a quarter only gets you six minutes, and quarters are a bit tough to come by in the neighborhood.

I've heard as much about the wait to eat here as I've heard about the food. Somehow I thought the rain would hinder people from going outside and more importantly, waiting for a table at this cozy (aka small) brunch spot... but alas, I was wrong. I think our total wait time approximated an hour to 1.5 hours but in the end it was well worth the wait. We sat at the counter to the right. The one with the large mirror with the specials of the day written in the bottom left corner. It was weird to stare at yourself or attempt not to at the beginning of our meal but I soon got used to it. We started off with the beignet sampler and ate in this sequence, as suggested by my friend: plain, cinnamon apple, ghiradelli chocolate and lastly, cajun crawfish. We paced ourselves but after the second beignet, I was losing steam and could only eat half of the chocolate and cajun beignets. My favorites are the cajun and apple. Overall, I would have preferred if the inside was a bit more doughy and soft but the filling for each was flavorful and warm. Wished they provided more filling and had less dough. Also, they should use Nutella for a filling.. heaven! We orded the ham and spinach benedict and the egg was cooked to perfection. I would recommend ordering it with only spinach. The ham was maple ham and the balance of savory and the maple sweetness didn't add up. We asked for the holandaise sauce on the side so I couldn't vouch for the taste but the potato hash was hearty and flavorful. I still prefer my standard home potatoes and not in hash form. Our last dish was the banana foster french toast and it was amazing!!! I highly recommend ordering this special if you have a sweet tooth or appreciate french toast as much as I do. The combination of banana, vanilla bean crean and french toast and maple syrup was perfection. At this point, I was completely stuffed but managed to eat a slice and a half before admitting defeat. Remember, the portions are meant for sharing!

Had an incredible yummy breakfast here today and I'm still licking my chops from the craw fish beignets (3 HUGE pieces for $6... wow-ieee), shrimp/goat cheese omelet, and tomato/bacon tartine. Portions were gi-normous and very fairly priced considering the amount and quality of the food. Service was also friendly and fast. Food is on the *heavy* side, though, so definitely go with an appetite. Brenda's is a small French/Creole spot in the middle of SF with easy parking (metered), but be prepared to wait for a table if you get there past 10:30... I heartily recommend and will be back when I have another beignet craving... now if they only served breakfast cocktails. ;)

I love this place, just like the way I love Zazie. It's so tiny but so cute. I counted, it can only fit 30 people in it, maximum. The weekend brunch line can be ridiculous, but the food is absolutely delicious. Must Trys by fellow yelpers: Watermelon iced tea: you just HAVE TO get it. I know it sounds skeptical, but it's so refreshing and unique. Beignet: get the sampler plate that way you get to taste all of the flavors. I have to say, the crawfish one didn't get me as much as the spiced apple one. Donuts are just not my thing, although they are really good that I am actually willing to finish them. Try them at least once. They are very nice in the afternoon with a cup of coffee. Must Trys by MY standard: -Shrimp and goat cheese omelette. Great combination. Oh yeah. -Fried oyster and bacon omelette- AMAZING!! I thought it sounded disgusting, but I craved for some oysters that afternoon. The oysters are fried to perfection, which means, super crunchy. But the oysters are HUGE and juicy...mmmmm.....and I'm still not very convinced by the oyster+bacon combination, but it was the best omelette I've ever had in my life. Things that changed my life (well, concepts that I've had for all my life): -Grits: I literally PUKED when I tried the grits for the first time in my life when I was a kindergartener, I hated it so much even though it was a sweet grit. But OMG, the grits here just blew my mind. It's soooooo buttery, and JUST SO GOOD! -Biscuit: to me, biscuit=dried piece of stone with funky flavor, usually served with some disgusting gravy. Here, the crust is so crunchy yet soft(i sometimes don't make sense), the interior is so buttery and flaky and soft that almost melts in your mouth. Best with the homemade strawberry jam there. I will just keep coming back and try different food. I wish it could be a little farther so I don't suffer so much for the fear of gaining weight.

OK. Here is what we did 1. Sampler plate of the beignets (I would recommend just getting one of the plain ones each, they really are the best despite the tempting flavors) 2. Watermelon Iced tea  (bottomless!!!) 3. Fried Shrimp or Fried Oyster Po-boy ( so f'ing fantastic) We got it with shrimp but Oyster is great too. 4. I got the special- Oyster, bacon scramble with cheddar grits and a biscuit. soooo...lots of food, good to go mid day during the week to avoid lines...but I hear they are expanding. The girls who work there were great. Very sweet and ready to help and explain.

Brunch: 4 Stars Lunch: 3 Stars Food: Crawfish Beignets: - excellent!  this is a must eat!   - the dough was crispy on the outside however warm and soft on the inside - they are each packed with plenty of crawfish meat, and if u ever had boiling crab, u must know that each crawfish contains a tiny dime sized amounts of meat - it is also filled with warm, gooey, cheesy, green-oniony blast of cajun flavor - topped with cajun seasoning - this is VERY salty, i would recommend scraping most of it off Lunch special: Chicken and Andouille Jumbalaya w/ salad - everything in this dish was SALTY! even the salad!   - other than that, there was nothing too remarkable about the other seasonings in the dish - i would NOT recommend ever getting this Brunch: Andouille Sausage and Cheddar Omelete - delicious omelet - comes with mushrooms - it was a very hearty brunch, and they certainly don't skimp on the sausage - juicy, and flavorful all the way through - potato hash - excellently fried - crispy and soft - piping hot, full of butter, and very tasty! - GET THE BISCUIT - NOT THE TOAST! the biscuit was EXCELLENT - so fresh and buttery.   its flaky when u bite in but soft and steaming in the center, probably one of the best biscuits i have ever tried - big hearty portions of everything - highly recommend brunch dishes similar to this Watermelon Iced Tea: - tastes like exactly what it sounds like, it was refreshingly cold when i went during brunch time, however when I went during lunch time, it was lukewarm... - would recommend trying at least once Service: - granted that they are always busy, service was terrible each time.  they do not come by to refill the tea or water, even when the food is salty and 3 glasses are completely empty - they ignore you and pretend you don't exist when you try to flag them down, i dont think the staff can handle pressure very well .. - we recieved 1 set of dirty dining ware - had to take clean ware from the neighboring table - this place is certainly NOT GOOD FOR GROUPS LARGER THAN 3 people Summary: overall, this is a place with good food but sub-par service, i would certainly come back here again to introduce people to this new orleans style food - go to brunch - get the crawfish beignets - go in small groups

I am so stoked that there is a innovative and fresh new place to try out in my shitty neighborhood! This is totally a place that you can find by the dozen in yuppified pac hieghts or noe valley AND its time that us folks in the TL get some of that love too!! I was really very excited to eat here. The restaurant is adorable and the food looks and smells great. However...it wasnt all that I hyped it up to be. We ordered the plan beignets...pretty good but Ive had better! Next time we are totally getting the "flight" of beignets (one of each kind) to make it more fun. For my brunch, I got the croque monsier sandwich with french fries (im not counting calories today!) and I asked if they could make it a croque madam (basically they just fry an egg and place it on top). The watiress didnt even know what that was and then said no. The sandwiches are already made...wtf is that supposed to mean? I oredered it anyway...against my better judgement. My bf ordered the veggie omelete that was packed full of spinach, onions, and corn. It was okay. The actual egg part of the omelette was excellent, but the fillings left something to be desired for. The potatoes were good...but not hashbrowns. The biscuit took longer to reach the table than the rest of our food, and though it was flaky and very soft inside, it may have been a little TOO soft inside. Almost like they didnt cook it all the way through. I ordered the house special watermelon iced tea...BIG MISTAKE. It was totally gross. I think alot of other diners seemed to enjoy it but I thought it was gross. I didnt taste like watermelon to me! The actual sandwich was gooey and pretty much flavorless. Every bite that contained ham was great...any bite that was ham-less was almost unedible. The french fries that came with my sandwich were oversalted but perfectly cooked. I felt so guilty about the meal I was eating so I only ate half of it. Next time, I am sticking to the daily specials. Hopefully those are not premade!

Good food, good service.  What more can you ask for? Be sure to put your name on the list outside as soon as you get here.  I got there today at 11:45 on a Wednesday morning and there were already 3 groups ahead of me and a packed dining room.  Luckily there's a cafe nearby to get some handwarming drinks while we wait.  I think in the end it only took 10-15 minutes.  Turnover is pretty good. Food was pretty NO authentic and very tasty. Portions are large.  If you are planning to indulge in a lunch option but want to have room for beignets, you might want to think about sharing.  I had the oyster poboy, which didn't look that big but I had a hard time finishing.  Then of course I couldn't skip the beignets (3 for $4) and now fast forward to me 4 hours later with a full stomach still. Bike Parking: designated bike rack right in front on Polk St.

YUMMYYYY Came here with Heidi C and friends but I have a different account than hers, go firgure. haha So, I'll structure this review just like hers hehe. The hour wait wasn't so bad, as long as you have good company to chat it up with. The more annoying part of it is having to worry about your freakin meter expiring before you step foot into Bbbrenda's. WATERMELON ICE TEA - 10 It was tasty, sweet, and came with unlimited refills. Sweeeet. FLIGHT OF BEIGNETS - 10 Yes. OMG is right. this might as well be my main course. I love me some donuts but these are even better. PLAIN - oooo sugarry goodness. APPLE - tastes kinda like a Baked Apple Pie from McD. CHOCOLATE - just like a toasted chocolate croissant. CRAWFISH - speechless, even had to take some to go. SWEET POTATO PANCAKES (served with BUTTER PECAN SYRUP) - 10 Awesomeness packed into a pancake. We were getting a tad low on the syrup so I had to ask for some more to drench my pancake in. CATFISH EGGS BENEDICT - 8 I always love me an eggs benedict. That said, I usually prefer them on an English muffin. Regardless, the eggs were almost perfect. One was a tad overcooked but oh well. The catfish was nice and tasty. It's just a shame the biscuit it came on crumbled apart. CROQUE MONSIEUR - 8 It's like a twice baked grilled cheese sandwich. Nice. HANGTOWN FRY - 6 Hmm, oyster and bacon scramble. I was skeptical at first but I dove right in. I was never a big fan of oysters so I could only take it in portions. SHRIMP & GRITS - 9 This is the dish I will order next time. More like a spicy shrimp and grit jambalaya. It's the perfect amount of spicy and keeps you coming back for me. I'll be back for more!!!!

An hour and thirty-five minutes wait is well worth it! Trust me considering the one thing I hate the most is waiting...! Chef-Owner, Brenda Buenviaje, is a Filipina who grew up in New Orleans who knows how to cook food for the soul.  I didn't need anymore persuasion when I heard the word: "beignets."  I was sold. Today was my lucky day.  Met my friend/roommate, Si-Eun, this afternoon at Brenda's and we waited, and waited, and waited to be seated.  A whole page of costumers on the wait list before us ("Celeste -- 2"), but I have to be honest that time passed by really quickly.  The place is small, really tiny, but people ate fast, I guess.  Lots of them carrying a white plastic "Thank You (X5)" bags on their way out...leftovers!  There's great, big portions and delicious tasting food that's inexpensive... what more can anyone ask for, right?  Neighborhood isn't too great, but I'm there for the food and service and both were impeccable :-)! To start, we had the coffee with chicory and a beignet sampler (crawfish (with cayenne, scallions and cheddar ), apple (with cinnamon honey butter), chocolate (molten Ghirardelli chocolate) and plain).  My favorite is the crawfish beignet, I couldn't get enough of it -- my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it.  I got the Eggs Benedict with Fried Catfish and hash.  The biscuit is to-die-for!  Si-Eun ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette with caramelized onions, topped with tomato-bacon relish and grits.  Everything was just perfect, all the different flavors was instant orgasm for my mouth! Yes, it was THAT good :-)! Would definitely come back again, and again, and again...!

There is nothing more I love more than having a kick ass breakfast on a foggy morning in SF.  This Sunday was no exception.  I have always driven by Brenda's when going up Polk to other eating establishments or bars of course but never was ready to have a brunch at Brenda's so this Sunday I was ready. The wait I was prepared for it is to warn you long as HELL....really it is. It's so long that people literally start to stare into the windows willing someone in there to finish up their meal and LEAVE.  Alas they never move as quickly as we want them to you know!  I have to say I took some joy in watching people get pissed while waiting.  Like yelling and questioning the waitstaff was going to get them in.  If anything I think the waitstaff made them wait more.  But finally our name was called and I walked into Brenda's for the first time. It is tiny only can fit about 35 people comfortably, but the waitstaff is very friendly and the service is efficient.  Waiting an hour and twenty minutes I knew what I was going to order and so I did.  Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelet with Grits and a bisicutt.  Also we ordered the Granny Apple Beignets.  My meal was so delicious I was overwhelmed by the flavors I was tasting.  The amount of shrimp and goat cheese was perfect!  I loved the grits which if you have never had you must get them here because they make them just like I have had when down south----everything was so yummy!! Now onto dessert during brunch - my fave!  The beignets were so good - perfect amount of sugar and very doughy!  We were so full we took them to go and they were still great hours later! I can't wait to come back because they had sweet potato pancakes that I MUST try!!!  The coffee is great too btw...I felt like I was in New Orleans and not foggy SF!  I will be back and please believe the hype about this little nook...it's worth the long wait due to the southern goodness you will unlock once inside!

Sigh - Brenda's to me = heaven. It's strange that the city has such a small selection of restaurants serving grits and I rely usually on Brenda's for my grits fix (2 times in one week!). Yes, the wait is pretty ridiculous but don't be overwhelmed by the list of names as most tend to drop off and give up pretty quickly! The first two times I went were on weekdays with small ~20 minute waits, but this last weekend I had to bring my out of town friend here with me (major brunch fan) and we braved the line despite 15 names listed before ours and a time crunch to boot. Nevertheless, 45 minutes later we were seated thanks to probably half of the names before us disappearing. Yes, patience is a virtue. My favorites and ordering staples: Catfish Poboy, Shrimp Poboy, Hangtown Fry with Oysters, Crawfish Beignets, Watermelon Ice Tea. Not impressed: French Toast with Cream Cheese (have never been a fan of french toast though!), Corned Beef Hash. Mediocres: Catfish Eggs Benedict, Shrimp and Goat cheese omelet. Key Sides: GRITS!!! (Freaking amazing, they must put crack in it because I can't stop eating it and start fantasizing about eating it again after walking just a block after leaving), biscuits. Seriously, the wait is crazy but it's there for a reason. You gotta try it!

Yummy food & OK service.  Will definitely come back, but not my favorite SF breakfast place! Beignet flight lived up to everything I had hoped!  The chocolate one is the best!  The flight is a meal in itself.  If you order this as an appetizer, then you are going to waste your entree, because you will have no room! Eggs Benedict with biscuit, fried chicken, and creole hollandaise is AWESOME! CHECK IT OUT! :)

Oh Brenda...Brenda...Brenda...you've been in my bookmarks, for restaurants to try for many, many, months now and I finally made it down to the TL to stand in line on Sunday and brave the 1 hour wait, to finally get a taste of what you're cooking.  And I have to say I was slightly disappointed. Granny apple beignets:  Beignets are supposed to be light and fluffy.  The dough was too thick/heavy and chewy; apples were overpowered by all of that cinnamon inside!  Tone the cinnamon down Brenda.  Tone it down. Chicken, okra, sausage gumbo:  The roux was a little too dark (i.e. hinging on a slightly burnt flavor), the chicken looked weird, but the overall flavor was pretty decent. What killed it was the ounce of oil literally sitting on top of the gumbo.  Ladel the oil off when the pot of gumbo is finished cooking folks.  It's not that hard.  My mom would just die if she knew you were serving gumbo to people like that! Catfish po-boy:  The remoulade sauce was yummy, the bread was a good combo of soft and crispy, the catfish fresh, but why did you have to ruin a perfectly good po-boy with all that butter on the bread?? Grits:  Tasty, but way too creamy and rich!  I'm pretty sure the grits were made with lots of butter already and ours came out with another 1/4 an inch of oil/butter sitting on top.  Yikes. House potatoes:  Great flavor.  Too salty. Biscuit:  Very tasty and soft especially with the house-made strawberry jam, but once again way too rich and buttery. So if you read through my breakdown of the dishes I tried here, you'll see a distinct pattern.  Way too rich, buttery, and salty all around.  I feel like the owners of this place are not really from the South/Louisiana and are just playing into common stereotypes held by folks on the West Coast about what southern food is all about (i.e fatty, greasy, salty, artery clogging, etc.).  And from the popularity of this place, I'd say that the stereotypes are winning. Anyways, it's 10 hours after my meal and I'm still feeling  a little icky about brunch earlier today.  Even though the prices were really reasonable, for health reasons, chances are I won't be coming back here anytime soon....although the french toast and eggs benedict did look tasty....

5 whole stars! Best brunch place in my book. There's no doubt Breanda's is worth the wait, shine or rain. My first visit here was on Monday after Christmas. I still had to wait for 45 minutes to get a 1' x 1' counter space in front of the mirror (note: since it was around the holiday time it was probably busier than regular Mondays). I was suffering from a hangover and was starving (seems like a repeated theme in my reviews...anyways), so I ordered a cup of gambo along with the day's special oyster scrambled eggs. The gambo was served promptly. It was thick, generous with lots of sausage and other goodies, and soothed my hangover & starved soul. It wasn't the best gambo i've had (not quite as good as the homemade gambo made by my ex's grandma in Louisiana) but better than most I've had at restaurants. Then there came the scrambled eggs with deep-fried oysters, served with buttery grits and fluffly biscuit, each of which deserved a praise. The scrambled eggs were the most creative and flavorful egg dish I've had in...in my life? The combination of the textures - the crunchy batter, fluffy egg, and soft and plump oyster....the mixing of flavors...delightful. I didn't mean to look weird but I am sure I had an orgasmic smiley face with my eyes closed.   Then I took a bite of the biscuit (with butter melting on it). I was sitting there eating by myself, but a loud cry of "OMG" came out of my mouth because it was so incredibly good, and I was not prepared for it being so good.  So rich yet airy, so intensely memorable yet delicate. A girl who was sitting next to me and eating also by herself suggested me to try the homemade strawberry jam. Oh this jam was as good as my grandma's homemade jam (brings me back some 20+ years). And grits....I had to talk to myself again..."Oh wow..."  The waitress caught my awe and winked at me.   So I went back a few days later - almost froze my toes off waiting for the table (stupid me wore open-toe shoes to look cute in January - not recommended). But again, it was worth the wait. My brunch companion loved it, too, and literally cleaned up the plate and gave me a very happy, satisfied nod & smile. What a happy place! I'm definitely going back, just not with open-toed shoes during the winter time.

Tried coming here a couple of times but the lines always seem so long so one day we decided to come early in the morning to see if we could beat the crowd.  Got there about 8:45am on a Saturday morning but there was already a line forming and the restaurant was already bustling.   Since they have lines all the time, I was having really high expectations for this place and boy, did they deliver.  We had the Andoiulle and Cheddar Omelette and the Egg and Bacon Tartine.  Both were excellent and really large portions.  We wanted to try the beignets too but when we were ordering we saw the breakfast items as being really large portions so we restrained but I doubt we'll be able to resist next time and let me tell you, there will definitely be many next times....   The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their chickory coffee.  I'll give them the fact that it made the experience here more authentic for that "Soul Food" flavor but not a big fan of it...

Went to Brenda's Soul Food for brunch on a rainy Saturday.  It was perfect - soul/comfort food on a crappy weather day. There was a wait but, the lines move quickly.  About 4 parties ahead of us but, we were squeezed in about 10-12 minutes after signing in (if there is a wait, you have to sign in on a clipboard that's hanging outside the door - kinda ghetto but, it works).   My friend and I shared the: - crawfish, with cayenne, scallions and cheddar beignets - granny smith apply, with cinnamon honey butter beignets - a  creole veggie omelette - a gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelette; and - grits and the best damn buttermilk biscuit and I've ever had in my entire life.  Better than KFC biscuits (y'all know KFC has dang good coleslaw and biscuits, don't wrinkle your nose in disdain).   Oh Lord have mercy!!!  SO.  FREAKIN'. GOOD.  A freakin' ORGASM IN MY MOUTH.  I usually reserve that phrase for desserts but, yeah - the food was that good.  The crappy weather probably added an additional "comfort" factor.  Oh - and that watermelon tea is yuuuummmm.  Free refills, baby.  Perfect on a summer day, and just as good on a stormy day. Our waitress was awesome - down to earth and no-nonsense.   FYI: If you go on Saturday, make sure you are get in/are on the wait list before 2:30pm-ish, because the restaurant closes at 3pm.

I've been yearning to eat at Brenda's and finally had a chance.  We signed in on their sign in sheet by the door at about 11:30AM.  We waited about 10-15 mins.  Not too bad a wait.  I had ordered the special which was the corned beef hash with carmelized onions, eggs and biscuit, a cup of gumbo and watermelon tea.  The corn beef has kinda of a rosemary taste to it.  The gumbo was delicious but a little oily.  The watermelon tea was fantastic and you get free refills. I really wanted to try the beignets, but was too full. The service was great .  Parking is not a  problem, but be sure to bring a lot of change for the meter cuz it might take awhile to get a table and to wait for the entree .

I see they're expanding next door. This could mean I may have more time to eat here if the lines are shorter. The old place was pretty cramped so hopefully this will also go the way of the long wait. So far I've tried the beignets, mmmmm yummy but still not worth the wait or the hype. I will try the Gumbo and Catfish benedict per others recommendations and report back here

Blonde Hostess is very RUDE!!! Slammed the door on us, crossed our name without calling our name. We were waiting right in front and we did not hear our name called. The people waiting with us also agreed that they did not hear our name called. The hostess then said we had to write our name on the list again. Horrible first experience! Management should carefully watch how their employees treat their customers, most especially the blonde host who needs GOOD service training. I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life!

This place is shit....I was wondering how long I could say that and keep a straight face.  (mmm about  4 nanoseconds) Yeah, yeah, yeah, ... we've all heard how ridiculously good this place is... uhm, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ... we've all heard how ridiculously long the wait to get sat...uhm, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ... we've all heard how ridiculously small it is inside...uhm, it is. Just go...because, well, you've heard about Brenda's, you've read about Brenda's, and you may have even seen the people waiting outside Brenda's (which makes the Taco Bell/KFC* place look like the happenist place in town).  So do your other senses a favor and taste and touch at Brenda's too.  Just make sure you have as good of company as I did to make two hours seem like two minutes. If you're really on the fence about going here, well my friend, you just aren't the lover of brunch that I am, and therefore, will be the asshole that will whine the entire time about waiting.  Do yourself, and the others in your party, a favor and skip Brenda's and meet them later.   *I have an ever-morphing verbal rant on this subject...

Bring a friend. Bring an appetite. Bring (a lot of) calories to spare. You will have to wait, but it's not as bad as the line would suggest. At least not the two times I've been. Each occasion we were fifth or sixth on the list and were seated within 30min. They get you in, feed you, and get you out in impressive fashion. Now about that feed. There is so much good stuff on the menu this is where I highly, highly encourage you to bring someone so you can try a little of everything. What should not be missed: Breakfast: Beignet sampler (plain, ghirardelli chocolate, apple and cinnamon honey butter and crawfish with chedder). All delicious, though your waistline might not want the whole thing. Take a bite. Smile. Move on to the next one. Shrimp and goat cheese omelet. Dive right into a mound of gooey sweet flavor, and savor the bits of caramelized onions and tomato bacon relish that further bring this amazing dish to life. House. Granola. Pancakes. Three words that usually have me ordering whatever they are offering, and in this case, it's one fantastic dish. Huge, huge pancakes with a vanilla bean cream and loaded with fruit. Epically delicious. Don't miss the peach jam on the side, a perfect complement to any of the above. Lunch: Sloppy Josephine v. Vegan Josephine. Do not choose one or the other. Get both (bring. a. friend!!!). One comes with turkey, the other with tofu, and each is soaking in a succulent tomato sauce. Slapped into a kaiser roll with no other toppings to muddle up the simple perfection, this is sandwich euphoria.

I'm always up for some down home creole cooking so I'd been looking forward to Brenda's for some time. Must say, the place did not disappoint. Sure I was slightly tipsy from my afternoon buzz (I'm not an alcoholic it was Saturday) but nonetheless our lunch was delicious. First off, you have got to order the chicken, sausage and okra gumbo. One, how many places serve a good gumbo. Two..I don't have a two, but One should have been enough. Oh right, two, also worth ordering is the grillades and grits and the pork po'boy. The catch is that the wait can be long but suck it up and go. It's something different and you just gotta come to terms with the fact that sometimes you gotta wait for a good thing.

Maybe it's not my type of food? Maybe I didn't order the right thing? I just didn't feel like it was worth the 30+ minute wait. Had the following: - Watermelon Iced Tea ($2.25): it's unique and refreshing. Get it. - Beignets Flight ($8): one of each type of all the freshly-made stuffed deep fried doughnut they offer: plain, crawfish, Granny Smith Apple, chocolate. Eat the more savory one first, the crawfish, then go for the apple and chocolate. Try the flight if you've never been there. The crawfish was the only standout for me. - Fried Shrimp Po-boy ($9.50): my stomach was greased up by the beignets so I was not feelin' this entree. A monster sandwich with deep fried battered shrimp with thousand island sauce on toasted French roll. I could only eat 1/3 of this sandwich and unfortunately it did not impress. - Grits: get it. If there is a next time, I'd go for the brunch menu instead of lunch and have more grits.

Yessss!!! After reading all the rave reviews about this place I finally got to try it yesterday.  5 stars happily granted. Here's what I ate: Started with the beignet (French donut) sampler:  Plain, Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple, and Crawfish.  Yes, CRAWFISH!  And just like everyone said, crawfish was the best.  But really, they were all pretty good, even the plain one.  The dough is fluffy and pefectly "plain" to make whatever else is flavoring the donut stand out all that much more.  For my main (keep in mind it's breakfast), I had the special:  Bananas Foster French Toast.  Oh yes I did!  Peep the pic cuz it speaks for itself.  I have a major sweet tooth and the French toast was definitely sweet enough to pass for dessert, but I got a side of bacon to make it a perfectly AWESOME breakfast.  And following another Yelp tip, I washed it all down with their Sweet Watermelon iced tea.  O yeah! Okay, I have a confession.  Call me a pig, I don't care.  Sooo.....there was a hair (or two) in my chocolate beignet..........and I still ate it.  Well, most of it.  But it was THAT GOOD!  And yes, I'm still giving out 5 stars cuz I was that impressed!!  And the guy there was appropriately apologetic about it and seemed genuinely embarrassed.  So hey, no harm no foul.  And they even tossed in a brand new one to take home.  So Brenda's, enjoy another great rating, buy some hair nets, and I can't wait to go back!!

Sorry guys... I didn't get it what's the hype about this place.  We stayed just next door @ Embassy Suite and found this place while browsing on my yelp application on iPhone (what's hot close by).  I guess I was eager to try it out seeing the lines outside plus the rating for this place.. so we all decide to go on the last meal of the trip on a brunch there.  Happy ending? Nah... The line was a huge wait, I didn't know there's a name list else I would put the name there and just go back to the room to sleep... I found out after we checked out.  Darn it.  =P  So I put on my name and went back to my car in the hotel garage and browse around on my laptop.  I went back to check after 45 min, it was just few more in front of us so I waited.  Listen people, they won't seat u until everyone in your party has arrived.   I didn't see the fine print on the paper until very end so I starting to call my friends.  Parking in this area is also hard so please come sooner, put your name down and go back to your car..don't feed the meter until they call your name.   We finally got seated at the bar along the wall, service wasn't not very fast b/c it was really really busy.. so we go ahead and order the beignet sample to start while looking over the menu.  I also order the coffee hopping it's a real strong French coffee like what the real New Orleans style.. beignets weren't good at all.. it wasn't what I expected.. although we all agree the cajun crawfish ones was the best among them. Coffee? It was a water down version..shouldn't have order it.. I ask them if it's strong and they told me yes. To make the story shorter.. here's what we had. - Gumbo: nah.. had better ones - Beignets: Go for the crawfish ones.. others don't even bother - Coffee: What a joke.. - Fried Oyster Po-boy: I just ate the Fried Oyster.. it's okay. - Catfish Po-boy: I ate a piece of catfish.. okay.. - Grillades and Grits: YUCK.. sorry.. the meats were very dry.. - Another Omelette w/ Oyster in it: that one I like.. at least it take more flavorful and special. Conclusion? Huge disappointment..... minus one more star..

HOLY BISCUITS this place is delicious. the boyfriend took me here for my birthday breakfast &, i must say, it was probably the best breakfast i have ever had.  we chilled outside Kentucky Fried Crap for about 30 minutes while we waited for our table. it was mid-morning on a friday & i actually expected the wait to be longer. we were seated at a four-top & promptly began salivating over the menu. we ordered the watermelon tea (I DIE!) & were still deciding when we were nicely asked by one of the staff if we wouldn't mind moving to a smaller table to allow room for a bigger party. we obliged because, honestly, i would eat on the sidewalk in front if they would still serve me. hell, i would even WAIT to eat on the sidewalk for this frickin food. we went big & ordered the flight of beignets. (it's my birfday & i'll be gluttonous if i want to). they were all wonderful but the crawfish definitely came out on top, so original & full of flavor! while the boyfriend enjoyed his andouille omelette, i pondered whether or not my shrimp & goat cheese omelette had stem cells & could successfully reproduce daily to serve my need for its perfection. i sadly concluded that this was not possible & devoured my meal. amy winehouse: crack = me: omelette. oh & the biscuits- delectable. & THE GRITS- i want to bathe in them. i felt about 3 months pregnant when we left but food babies are the only babies i will be having in my tummy for a long while, thank you very much. if the rumors are true, brenda will be expanding into the laundromat next door. i guess this would solve some customers' issue with the wait/space situation. i will come back no matter what because, to me, brenda's french soul food is the epitome of OM NOM NOM NOMMM!!!

I used to eat this weekly for lunch.  Then I realized I was turning into a ball of fat.  Best biscuits in SF! Haven't been back in sometime, though; dishes can get repetitive if you eat there often.  Not worth the wait though, if you're coming for brunch on a weekend.  Get it to go (doesn't taste that much better dining in) or go on a week day.

BF and I came on a Saturday morning, around 11 and to no surprise there was a line. We put our name on the waiting list and were asked immediately if we mind sitting on the counter seats. Since if was just us both, of course we don't mind! So we were seated right then and there while everyone else waited for table seats, (they all had a bigger party). http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This place is tiny. The tables and chairs are very close together. The lady sitting next to me was so close that her utensils were on my napkin and we both can't help but graze each others arm with every movement. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Plain Beignet: Self explanatory, just straight up plain and dry. I've had better plain doughnuts that comes in a plastic wrap. Chocolate Beignet: Filled with dark, rich Ghirardelli chocolate. Not too bad, but a bit too rich for us. It's probably great for dark chocolate lovers who appreciate the slight bitter taste. Granny Smith Apple Beignet: What a generous amount of cinnamon apples! It's not too sweet and the apples were cooked until soft but still with a little crunch to it. This is our favorite amongst the four beignets. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Crawfish Beignet: It's loaded with cheese, but not much crawfish. Sprinkled with lots of cayenne powder on top. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Eggs and Bacon Tartine: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… A layer of tomato relish, Gruyere cheese, scrambled eggs, and two strips of bacon served on top of a toasted French roll with choice of grits or potato hash. Andouille and Cheddar Omelette: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Sausage, mushrooms, onions topped with tomato sauce (I asked for NO cheese) served with grits or potato hash and a choice of toast or biscuit. Sweet Watermelon Tea: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This is their house specialty drink. We noticed almost every table had one and our waitress recommended it also, so we got it. It didn't have much watermelon flavor only because there were only three or four strips of watermelon rind in it, but I definitely tasted the basil. They should call it Basil Tea (w/ watermelon garnish). However, it was quite refreshing. The portions of the egg dishes were overwhelming, but we both managed to force ourselves to finish it. Neither one was bad, but nothing really stood out. I wish they hadn't over cook the potato hash though, because I would have given them an extra star just for some good breakfast potatoes. Inexpensive, fast and friendly joint. I'll probably come back to try their lunch menu (maybe Fried Shrimp Po-Boy), but I will not come again for breakfast.

Being from the south, I've been on a search for good southern food in the Bay Area.  I heard about Brenda's and thought I'd give it a try. Design The design is simple and pleasant - but small and very cramped. A couple of tables really need to be taken out.  It's impossible to read the specials - white letters on a mirror?  The reflected glare made that impossible.  The background music was really good. Service Southern hospitality was never given a thought at this place!  While the waiters were not rude, they were pretty incompetent.  Service was incredibly slow.  We ordered the iced tea.  It arrived after our gumbo (after waiting 30 minuntes) and having to ask for it again! Food This is were I really had high hopes - especially given the rave reviews on here.  First up was a cup of the gumbo.  It had a good flavor, but nothing special.  I then had the "Grillades and Grits".  It comes with two eggs, any style.  I ordered "over medium".  What arrived was "over easy", if that; some of the egg whites were still runny (yuck).  The grits were tasty, but they had formed a skin by the time the plate was served (ugh).  The sauce for the grillade was very tasty, but note to the chef...take the bay leaves out before serving.  I almost choked a couple of times.  The only really good item was the biscuit.  my partner liked his oyster po'boy...and really wanted to try the beignets.  He decided to forego them, because we had waited so long for everything else. I don't think I'd come back...super-slow service can pose a parking ticket risk!

I'm pretty sure I have already reviewed Brenda's but here goes another one. I now live in Southern California and haven't even been here in 6 months but I still crave your shrimp & grits and those beautiful crawfish beignets. Everyday, seriously. Every time I meet someone that is going to Sf or even says San Francisco- I always insist that they find you and try your amazing comfort food; even if that means waiting outside for over an hour in the freezing rain for their table. It is worth it. So worth it.

We waited almost an hour for a table for two, but it was worth it.  (There were also a couple big parties ahead of us.)  I had the Vegan Josephine with fries and pickle chips with a watermelon iced tea.  Delicious!  Although, I kinda regret not ordering breakfast instead...just because I would have liked to try the grits! The place is cozy and clean and the staff is quick and friendly.  I am very partial to the colors red, black and white.  They turn tables over fairly quickly, but they aren't pushy. And, the most important part that needs no other explanation: biscuits.

Ummmmm...no offense but I HATE this place.  I've always wanted to try their food because it had such good ratings on yelp, but when i went with my friends for breakfast it was completely horrible experience. This is a hole in the wall.  It's so tight that there's no way to manuveur.  The tables were sticky.  GROSS.  And when the waitress finally decided to take our tables' order she totally disregared me and started to walk away.  I'm like hello?!  Are you a f****** stupid??!?!?  I gave her the nastiest look ever.  And it all kept going downhill from there.  I ordered the biscuts and gravy that came with two very dried biscuts and a small cut of gravy.  I've had better, in a shitty town called Chico, 185 miles from San Francisco.  The potatoes are just like at any other restaurant, really nothing special.  I finished my water and they left my glass empty.   Will I be returning?  Definitely not.  I'd rather try some other soul food place with better service and better food. Thinking about this place still frustrates and angers me. How hard is it to see that there are four f****** people at the table and not 3?  No wonder you are a waitress.  So incompetent.

Mon dieu! Je veux tout les beignets! Patience is a virtue - and also a requirement if you want to eat here.  Your patience will be rewarded well after one bite of a crawfish beignet, spoon of gumbo, or sip of watermelon iced tea. The restaurant is small, hence the wait. The service is as friendly as can be, even considering the grouches that walk through the door. The neighborhoood?  Let's not talk about that... My goal in life is to try everything on the menu - I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted because I wanted EVERYTHING!  Last time I went, I had the Croque Monsieur and the BF had the Egg & Bacon Tartine. We shared a cup of gumbo and a beignet flight.  Everything was excellent. The crawfish beignet is to die for, followed closely by the chocolate beignet. Go and practice your patience, you won't be disappointed!

Today my feelings for French Soul Food switched from "like" to "like-like...a lot!!!" This is the best restaurant meal I have had in a while and I literally licked the plates clean (sorry for disgracing you, family).   "Danielle, party of 3" ordered a Flight of Beignets, a Fried Shrimp Po'Boy, the Banana Bread Pudding French Toast with Bourbon Pecan Sauce*, and the Braised Shortribs over Cheesy Grits with a Sunny-Side-Up Egg*. Sounds drool worthy, right?  INDEED!  *Sadly the last 2 dishes were daily specials so I can't guarantee that they'll be there when you go, but there are similar items on the regular menu. The beignets were nice and hot and the fillings were of high quality.  I've had fluffier beignets that I liked better, but these were really tasty.  The sampler is definitely the way to go - chocolate, plain, apple cinnamon, crawfish.  We split each beignet into 3 bites and were more than satisfied. Brenda's Po'Boy is awesome!  Delicious remuloude, nicely fried shrimp, and well-seasoned french fries earned praise from all at the table. Banana bread pudding was also a big hit.  I couldn't really taste the banana, but the bourbon pecan sauce was phenomenal.  I dragged my last bite of toast all over the plate (three times) to get every last sticky drop! The braised short ribs over cheesy grits really impressed me.  The dish was packed with flavor and surprisingly light.  I loved the braised short ribs: super tender and off the bones.  I know this dish wasn't good for me figure-wise, but it was totally worth it.  Wash it down with a watermelon sweet tea and you will be a happy camper. The veterans know that: *Pairs get seated MUCH faster since they can sit at the bar.  "Danielle, party of 3" waited over an hour on a Monday for a table. *They do take-out with a $0.25/dish take-out charge. *The place is really tiny; prepare to make some new friends. *Nothing on the menu costs more than $10 (as far as I could tell)!  Sweet deal!

Dear Brenda, As Mariah Carey would say, "oh baby baby we belong tooogether!!!" Hear me out Brenda before you scoff at this idea.  First, we're both Louisiana transplants that live in San Francisco.  Second, we both went to LSU.  Third you love cooking Louisiana food, and you WITHOUT a doubt cook the BEST Louisiana food in San Francisco and probably in California (best I've had so far at least). Taking that first bite of red beans INSTANTLY brought me back to cafeteria days in elementary school and college days at the Chimes (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…)  I knew it was love at first smell of flatulence.   The roux on the gumbo was ditch water dark and THICK.  Just the way we all love it.  Definitely much better than Farmer Brown's. Your biscuits....OMG.  I brought these home as leftovers....and didn't even warm them up.  I ate it cold.  Honestly, Al Copeland should be rolling in his grave, because you make them better than Popeye's. I love a creative woman.  Your crawfish beignets are something new and definitely different.  Kudos to you for having good crawfish in the beignets.  Wasn't expecting decent crawfish tails in there. Finally, kudos for serving Community Coffee.  That red bag of Community Coffee was a sight for sore eyes.  There's a reason why Starbucks was never able to have a real presence in south Louisiana. Brenda, i'm sprunnnnnnng.  You keep cooking and I will keep doing the dishes. 504 love 4 life, Kyle P.S.  Marry me Brenda

Can't deny what the 1,000+ reviews are saying and I agree.  Brenda's is a sweet find.  Happened to arrive during a no wait moment with a four top table free and clear.   The restaurant's decor is quaint and cozy with minimal yet smart decorations that make the place feel comforting.  We ordered up more comfort:  Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette w/ potatoe hash; and Grillades and Grits of beef cutlets braised in Creole spicy gravy served with grits and eggs w/ their fabulous biscuit (totally amazing!)  Oops, not to mention the beignets.  We ordered the plain as an appetizer, delicious.  Not as good as Cafe du Monde though. The tank of watermelon iced tea on the counter looked tempting, however we were stuffed beyond measure.  Service was efficient and friendly.  By the time we were done, there were waves of people waiting and filling the emptying tables and counter top (squeeze on in).   A joyous find and satisfying treat.

If you could only have one meal a day, Brenda's wouldn't be a bad one to have. I ate at Brenda's yesterday with a bunch of out-of-towners and we had a lot of food. A flight of beignets, shrimp and grits, french toast, andouille omelette, sweet potato pancakes, and watermelon sweet tea. Amazing. - The beignets, including the crawfish, are really more like a flavored pastry than what I was expecting, something like a hot pocket. Nonetheless delicious. - The french toast and the sweet potato pancakes were rich and sweet, as expected. The pancakes, however, get points for having an unexpected richness in texture, and a savory quality to them that made them stand out a bit. - Surprisingly the star of the andouille omelette plate was the buttermilk biscuit. Flaky on the outside, decadently rich and moist on the inside. I've never had anything like it. The potatoes were a big soggy and heavy, and the omelette, despite the hype, I've had better. The eggs were dry and overcooked, and the filling was a little sparse. - Shrimp and grits? My god. Just looking at that dish made my heart skip a beat. Just imagine a shrimp pizza with cream sauce, and scooping the entire top layer of the pizza off and pouring it into a bowl. Yes, it's that rich. - Watermelon sweet tea. A must have. Rich enough so you can feel the watermelon pulp when you sip it, but not overwhelmingly sweet either. Refills without having to ask for them? Excellent. I'd come back again, but only before it opens. We came on a Monday morning, and by the time we left, it looked like the wait  had grown from about half an hour to maybe an hour. It was worth it for a first time visit, but again? I say plan ahead and get there as early as possible.

I was soooo excited when I find out a new restaurant was opening up in my hood.  I was even more excited when I found out that the restaurant served creole / soul food.  I wanted to try Brenda's ASAP. I went to Brenda's last Saturday for brunch and gave up on it after seeing that at least 15 people were waiting to be seated.   I went back today for lunch.  There were a few good things about this establishment such as; 1. Tenderloin is full of Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, and Indian restaurants.  But I don't know any good non Asian place. 2. Their biscuit is really REALLY good.  They are brown on the outside and moist and flaky inside.  I loved the biscuit and I'll give them 5 stars! But I didn't like: 1. They were out of crawfish.  (the waiter told me they run out right before I came...) I'm kind of person who think about food pretty much all the time.  I usually check the menu of the restaurant I am going before I go. So, I decided last Saturday I was having crawfish at Brenda's.  I was very disappointed to find out that they were out... 2. I ordered  Grillades and Grits  $ 9.75 and the beef and sauce were cold...  and it tasted nothing special. Bottom line, If they let me, I may order 12 biscuits to go.  I'll not wait in the line to eat there though...

I can't wait to go back to Brenda's! Had brunch here a few days ago and I swear to you I am still thinking about that magnificent meal several days later. I tried the flight of beignets as an appetizer and although all of them were tasty, the crawfish beignet with a dusting of cayenne pepper on top was, by far, the best on the plate. I'll have about six of those the next time I visit you, Brenda. Is it all right if I call you Brenda? I figure we should get to know each other on a first name basis so that it's a little less awkward when I bring you home to meet Mother. I decided to be adventurous and try one of Brenda's specials as my entree. That turned out to be an excellent decision. My eyes lit up when I saw the bowl of cheddar grits with sauteed shrimp and bacon / tomato relish placed before me. I've had grits before. I've had shrimp before. But I have never had anything quite like this. What a flavor sensation. The perfect amount of cheddar, shrimp and grits cooked to perfection and what's this? Bacon??? Are you kidding me? This dish could stand on its own without the bacon / tomato relish but that extra touch made this savory meal truly outstanding. Who tipped you off about my love of bacon, Brenda? To wash down this glorious brunch, I tried a watermelon iced tea simply because it received so many rave reviews and recommendations from fellow Yelpers (thank you all).  When (not if) you go to Brenda's, you have GOT to try this iced tea. Not too sweet, with a very light and refreshing taste, this would be my go-to drink on a sweltering summer day. Be advised that Brenda runs her business out of a small cafe so you may be waiting awhile for a table. Let me tell you it is well worth the wait. Not only is the food excellent, the service is as well. Brenda is back there herself cooking up the meals and I found her staff to be friendly, attentive and professional in spite of the non-stop flow of hungry patrons. Great people, delicious food, and...... I know for a fact that I heard Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles coming out of those stereo speakers. Nice touch, Brenda. Keep up the great work. See you soon. Sincerely, Your #1 Fan (not stalking you) ( yes I am) (just kidding) (no, I'm not), Rory

Now, I born and raised in NOLA, and while I can't say I'm a connoisseur of good New Orleans cooking seein' that my momma didn't cook too much cajun food (bein' that she's from Taiwan), I can recognize good cookin' when I taste it. And Brenda's is good cookin'. Skip the Beignet Flight and just get the Crawfish one if you're feeling savory and the Apple one if you're feeling sweet. The Chocolate one over does it (unless you REALLY love chocolate); and the Plain one, well, that's self-explanatory. Don't get me wrong, I normally love plain beignets - those are the only types I've ever had - but they just couldn't get it right. Not the fluffy, chewy pillow of steaming goodness you find at Cafe Du Monde or Morning Call, but a flat, tough, bored piece of flattened fried dough with so little powdered sugar on it your daddy would cry if he saw it. Other than that, you can't go wrong with the grillades and grits. The biscuits are about as good as they get. The specials are also always enticing. Overall, the menu doesn't disappoint with it's offerings and creativity, but the staples definitely stand out.  In fact, a perfect meal might be 2 crawfish beignets, 2 biscuits, and an apple beignet with a cup of cafe au lait to top it off. Who needs vegetables, anyway. The secret to eating quick - make it a date and keep the party size to 2. You might sit at the bar (which faces a giant mirror, so you might even find out if your date has narcissistic tendencies), but hey, at least you won't have to wait an hour to get in.

Oh, My, Goodness. If I had to spend 2000 calories anywhere, Brenda's is among the top on my list. I've tried a bunch of soul food places in SF - Bluejay's, Nickies, Farmer Brown, Cajun Pacific...but none of them can touch Brenda's. - The Crawfish Beignets kick serious ass - oozing with hot melted cheese, green onions & crawfish in every bite. Get these instead of the plain beignets, which were just okay. - The Gumbo was bar none the best I've had in SF. The large size is a meal in inself so get a cup if you want to try other items - The Oysters in our Po' Boy were crisp, plump & fresh - We also shared an order of the Shrimp & Cheese Grits, a giant bowl of super cheesy grits topped with mounds of bacon bits & plenty-o-shrimp - I've also had the Egg & Bacon Tartine, which is egg-cellent - The Watermelon Ice Tea was okay, a little murky for my taste. Good coffee though. The only downer is, of course, walking out of here vowing never to eat again while fighting the impending cholestrol-headache that I seem to be prone to...so I'll have to put Brenda's on a quarterly rotation and allow my arteries to clear up before going back~

I've had this place bookmarked for 5 million years and I FINALLY tried it! It was everything I thought it would be & more :) Vincent K., Terence S., & I had the... -Crawfish beignet: SO GOOD!!! I could probably eat a couple of these and call it a completely satisfying meal. Can't really describe it... you just have to try it for yourself! -Gulf shrimp & goat cheese omelette: This was just ok. I like breakfast/brunch foods regardless, but compared to the beignet, this was just average. The hash was on the mushy side -- I like my potatoes more well-roasted/fried. Biscuits are always good! -Catfish po'boy: Yum! Such a good sammy, love the sauce. -Some omelette w/ oysters? I have horrible memory. Grits are great! A little goes a long way. -Sweet watermelon tea: MMM SO REFRESHING!!! TIP: Come early,     come late,          but there will always be a wait!

This past weekend was the weekend of brunch and we started out here.  Waiting in line, like everyone else.  But as others have said before me, it was worth it.  Our servers were super accommodating, so any post-wait grumpiness I felt towards them immediately dissipated when they sat us down and took my coffee order. There were 4 of us and between us we tried the following dishes.  Here's our feelings: Okra gumbo-- Tasted like a super rich beef barley-type soup.  Okra was crunchy, not slimy.  Excellent soup and the cup was huge-- if we had ordered a bowl, I might have been able to take a bath in it. Apple-cinnamon beignets-- The beignets were big, warm and sweet without being cloying.  The apple filling was fresh tasting and so much more sophisticated than that of normal apple pie-type desserts.  Super yum. *Special* Fried catfish benedict-- First of all, the benedicts here come on an absolutely amazing, flaky biscuit, which is a stroke of genius.  The catfish was lightly fried and the cajun hollandaise was out of this world.  A really excellent dish.  And the side of cheesy grits was spot-on as well. *Special* Shrimp and grits-- Also an outstanding dish.  They were very generous with the shrimp (at least 6-8) and the grits are covered in spicy, cheesy, bacony goodness.  And the portion was huge (we savored the second half the next day). Egg and Bacon tartine-- A solid breakfast but not quite as sophisticated as some of the other dishes.  Basically its a half of a hero roll topped generously with bacon, scrambled eggs and gruyere cheese.  I feel like I wasn't expecting that when I read "tartine."  But its very possible that I don't know what a tartine is.  Still, delicious, but more like a basic bacon and eggs-type meal. *Special* Bacon and oyster scramble-- Maybe the only "miss" of the bunch /brunch.  You really have to like oysters if you order this dish.  I think we kind of forgot how much oysters taste like ocean.  So if you want a scramble that tastes like the ocean, you will probably like this special but we weren't crazy about it.  That might have been our bad with ordering, though.  In any event, the oysters aren't subtle if  you are inclined to think that. All in all, a really A+ meal.  Next time I just might have to line up before it opens!

Brenda's is a nice surprise in the neighborhood.  I love the decor.  Great red color, mirrors to make the tiny place look bigger, and a fabulous clock (which I would steal if I could). Fabulous Apple Beneigts and the Crawfish ones too.  I have never liked crawfish, but if it is being served to me like it was at Brenda's, bring it on.   The Gumbo was wonderfully flavored and the Sloppy Josephine was, well, to die for.  I couldn't stop shoving it in my face.  I wish they were open on the weekends so I could go for brunch. Also, the waitress is very easy on the eyes...which is always a plus.

This place is amazing! I was pleasantly surprised to find such a cool and delicious breakfast/lunch joint in the TL. After a night out Brenda's soul food was just what my body needed. The menu is full of comfort food and made it difficult to settle on just one meal. After much debate I finally ordered the bacon and egg tartine. Fantastic! i ate the whole thing and then some... We finished off breakfast with the chocolate beignet, a decadent ball of dough that should be illegal. One order gets you three of the chocolate filled doughy goodness...yum! My only complaint is that the service was a little slow, at least 20-30mins past between when our order was taken and when we got our food. Nonetheless it was definitely worth the wait and I would definitely go back here again!

Might as well add to the thousands of reviews on here, since I drive all the way from Modesto with at least a small part of my motivation being to eat here. I would recommend the breakfast or brunch over the dinner. The only thing I have had here I was not blown away by was the fried chicken. Not that it is not good, just not as life-changing as say the Jambalaya. Don't go Sunday morning unless you feel like waiting FOREVER.

I think this would have been a four star review, for if it had not been the amount of diarrhea (I can never spell that word) I experienced after eating a really great meal. Standing in the cold, I waited in an area where it seemed most of the inhabitants were disenfranchised and had no clue what day it was. They didn't really seem to care about anything except where and when their next meal was. Even the trash didn't know where it was going when a mini tornado whipped it into a frenzy. Welcome my friend, to the tenderloin at 9 am in the morning. Before it came out as liquid feces, I had the eggs florentine, half a gigantic biscuit, and an extremely sweet butter pecan topped french toast. Heavy, but oh so delicious. I don't know if it was worth the stomach cramps though.

WORTH THE WAIT. And, the wait isn't even that long if you go at the right time. I love this place. First of all, I love soul food. Second of all, this place rocks my socks off. I love the atmosphere, very casual. Of course, I came here for the crab beignets that are on the 7x7 List. Well, I decided to order the beignet flight because I thought, might as well try all the beignets. Annnnd, I can see why the crab beignet is the favorite one. It is amazingly delicious and flavorful. So so so good! There were also the normal beignet (tastes like a cake-y doughtnut), a chocolate beignet (meh) and an apple pie filling beignet (meh again, but I'm biased because I don't like apple pie). The savory one beat out the sweet ones, by far. I also had the watermelon iced tea--which is refillable! I didn't know that, and when the waitress kept coming over to refill, I was just so happy. I liked the ice tea! I would definitely come back to try the other dishes. Everything here looks soooo good. And, the serving sizes are beyond large.

the 45 min wait in the freezing cold is so worth it for a mouth full of their fluffy beignets, this i can attest to. However, the po-boy was a let down. The roll and ingredients were fresh but the chipotle rémoulade over powered the tasty fried shrimp. It tasted more like a table spoon of  really bland mayo instead of chipotle. Hoping this was a fluke. but hey i got my beignets! woot woot!

Mmm mmm mmmmmm! Crawfish Beignets. Bananas Foster French Toast. Hangtown Fry. Watermelon Iced Tea. Yuuuup, this meal was pretty amazing. Lemme start off by saying my visit was on a late Monday morning and there was NO WAIT. Already my experience at Brenda's was off to a great start! I thought I would have a hard time ordering (I'm so indecisive, especially about food) but my eyes zeroed in on the Hangtown Fry. Crispy Oysters, bacon & scallion scramble? With potatoes AND a cream biscuit!? Hell yes! I also knew our order would be incomplete without the famous Crawfish Beignets so my party ordered one to share. The Beignets were light, savory & spicy! But I totally dug it, the filling was delish and totally new to me. I've never had anything quite like it before. My boyfriend ordered the Bananas Fosters French Toast which I got to sneak a couple of bites from. YUM! The bananas were fresh and the whipped cream was definitely homemade, sooo good. And my Hangtown Fry was wonderful. I was very surprised with the amount of "crispy" oysters in it, there must have been about 8 of them! The only *minor* complaint I have is with the potatoes. The portion was big, but the flavor wasn't quite there. Maybe it's because I like my potatoes a bit crispy and this hash wasn't at all? Whatever the reason, the potato hash didn't impress. Like everyone else says, the Watermelon Iced Tea is refreshing & as I can imagine, would go great with almost anything on the menu. Service was good & I loved the quaint atmosphere of Brenda's. Already looking forward to my next visit! I can't wait, the rest of the menu looked downright scrumptious.

I have found a new favorite brunch spot in SF. The chef, Brenda Buenviaje (awesome last name, I must say :) did a wonderful job bringing the flavors of Louisiana to the city of San Francisco. My usual overindulgent dining companions and I ordered: 1) Gumbo: A perfect balance of okra, sausage and rice. 2) Beignet Flight: Melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. They were out of the savory Crawfish beignets, so we had chocolate, plain and apple. I love having dessert for brunch. 3) Andouille Sausage and Chedder Omlette: The sausage is the star of this dish with its perfect spice and flavor. 4) Egg and Bacon Tartine: A simple open-faced sandwich topped with a salsa of roasted tomatoes that brought the perfect sweetness to contrast with the saltiness of the bacon. 5) Grillades and Grits: The grits were creamy and delicious, like a melted form of cornbread. Mmm. Some valuable pieces of advice for visitors: - Come early. Brunch is only served until 3pm and by 2:30, they began turning people away. Don't cut it too close to closing, or you'll miss out. - Good things are worth waiting for. It's a very small place, so a wait is inevitable. Be patient and you will be rewarded. Also, we just found out they're going to start opening for Sunday brunch this month so watch out for that!

The goat cheese and shrimp omelet is spectacular. I know it sounds like a horrible food abortion, but trust me. The andoille omelet is also amazing. There is like an inch of delicious grease underneath from all the sausage and cheddar (in the good way)! Their lunch options are great as well. I'm not a huge fan of the beignets, but I am a huge pastry snob. I lost 100 pounds a few years ago, so for me to eat something crappy AND filled with carbs, it had better make me see the face of the Virgin Mary and/or simulate a sexual experience in my mouth.

The wait can be sooooooooo long but oh so worth it! If you go with a group of 6 the wait can be about 2 hours or at least that's how long we waited (outside in the rain). Our waitress was so nice! The food reminds me of when I lived in NOLA. We ordered a few things to share as a table. The first treat was the flight of beignets and they were SO good! My fav was the crawfish beignet and the chocolate filled beignet. I was secretly hoping that everyone else at the table hated the beignets so that I could have them all to myself. ;-) The pancake we shared was so fluffy and yummy. The oyster po boy was ok and the fries were amazing! I ordered the egg and bacon tartine which was good. The grits are amazing!! My friend gave me a piece of his biscuit and OMG that was so good too! Top if off with a cafe au lait. I highly recommend coming to Brenda's for brunch just be prepared for a possible long wait.

This place is a definite "must eat at..." while in San Francisco. Our breakfast started off with the Beignets Sampler. Subjectively speaking, my favorite was the crawfish. The doughnut was cooked perfectly -- flaky and steamy. The crawfish was cheesy and delicious! The chocolate was pretty good, too. My wife had their Tartine w/ hash. I personally would have went with the grits, as I'm not too big of a fan of big chunks of potatoes. The roll was soft yet crunchy and buttery, the bacon - crispy, and the relish was nice and tart. A perfect compliment to this already delectable dish. I had their Grillades w/ Eggs over easy and Biscuits. All I can say is... "MMMMMmmmmm!" Great food and awesome service! What more can I ask for?

Crispy Black-Eyed Peas. These were okay, kind of reminded me of those crispy wasabi peas. I didn't really like the crisp they had. Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea. So good! My fave drink ever! I love how it's the perfect mix of watermelon juice and iced tea, yum! Hushpuppies. Fried Cornbread with Chipotle Remoulade. This was pretty good, they were fried with scallions so they were extra fragrant. Not to mention the fact that I love cornbread! However, I do think the hushpuppies at Angeline's are better because of their honey butter. Shrimp and Grits. Sauteed Shrimp, Cheddar Grits and Spicy Tomato-Bacon Gravy. This was pretty good, not as nommy as it was last time. So maybe it was an off day but I guess it could also be because I had less time to enjoy it since I was rushing to get to the Billy Elliot performance.

Good, good brunch which deserves three and a half stars. Had a satisfying brunch after running the Run SF Marathon this morning. The following was ordered: * Andouille and cheddar omelette with sausage, cheddar, mushrooms, scallion atop their special sauce. It was served with potatoes and toast. Very hearty! * Beignet Flight which consisted of: ** the traditional beignet topped w/ powdered sugar (I ate it with some jam that was placed at the table as a condiment) ** one that was filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate. It was very rich and yummy, but I think it would have been yummier with nutella. I ate this together with the ** beignet with crawfish, scallions, and cheddar dusted with cayenne pepper. This was my favorite! It was spicy hot. Coupled with the sweet chocolate beignet, the combination was a match made in heaven. ** The fourth beignet was filled with Granny Smith apples and cinnamon honey butter. This specialty plate costs $8.00. Completely worth it! Their watermelon iced tea is delicious as well. My glass was kept well-filled. Their customer service is all that and a bag of chips. We came minutes just before they opened since we finished the race early. At that time, the place was already quickly filling up. By the time we left, the wait outside looked horrendous! Definitely come early for brunch if you don't want to wait a long time. I've been wanting to come here for the longest time and I'm glad that I finally did. It was well worth it!

We must have lucked out since from reading the reviews, there's always a wait here.  We were able to be seated immediately.   Given it was our first time here, we had to try the beignets so we ordered the flight of four: plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish.  I thought the plain and crawfish ones were OK.  I don't have a huge sweet tooth but the apple and chocolate were tasty.  The chocolate makes a great dessert after the fact considering the size of the entrees. We ordered the grits and shrimp and a veggie omelette.  The grits and shrimp was an extremely tasty, heart-attacking inducing concoction of grits, cheese, and sauteed shrimp that was well worth the hit on my arteries.  The omelette was pretty standard but the biscuit that came w/ it was butterily delicious.

I heart Brenda's. My wonderful bf and I had a date night here, well, around 5:30ish today (saturday). We literally live 3 mins from this place and we were lucky once we got in, although packed, we were the next 2 seater. drink of choice: Sweet Watermelon House Tea (incredible, kind of like watermelon agua fresca) It being our first time here, we needed to try a lot of dishes. starters: -Crawfish Beignet (heavenly, fluffy dough, hot savory deliciousness inside) -Garlic Shrimp Gratin (shrimps were good, but not the focal point, the piquillo pepper & goat cheese fondue was finger lickin delicious with toast) - Cup of Chicken, Sausage & Okra Gumbo (very good, not as amazing as Eric's from Fat Alley) entrees: -Cornmeal-fried Oyster Po'boy (huge portion! very flavorful, coleslaw on the side was just right) -Catfish des Allemands (crawfish éouffé was good, pilaf was a great choice for this, the catfish could maybe used a pinch of salt, but has large tender flakes) -One piece of BFC (perfectly fried with a beautifully crisp skin, juicy meat) dessert (yes, we pushed through to eat more) -Beignet flight (best hot is plain, best room temp is the chocolate. apple one is eh.) -Bread Pudding (special of night, hot, chocolatey, plump raisins) Service was great, servers super helpful and friendly. A++

Came here on Friday for lunch. Waited for about 10 minutes when we arrived at 12:10PM. The place is small and packed, but this place is MMMMMM! watermelon house ice tea = super refreshing! Beignets Flight - Plain, apple, chocolate, and CRAYFISH.. I recommend sharing this appetizer. I loved the plain, the chocolate is as good as any fresh chocolate filled buttery goodness, such as a croissant or a crepe, crayfish was fantastic! crispy outside, cheesy, seafood spicy goo on the inside. and apple, i only had a small bite because i'm ALLERGIC TO APPLES, but from what I had, mm. croque monsieur = i love crispy bread crust with slightly grilled cheese, savory ham and this is all that in one. my friend had the french toast and it was awesome. coleslaw is fresh and not soaked in mayo and the sausages are a MUST. mos def will return to try others like po'boy sandwich or banana foster french toast or any of the other breakfast delights! thumbs up: all, and all under $10! thumbs down: eh the neighborhood, but whatevers.

First things first, let me get the bad news out of the way.  I was walking up Polk Street this morning on my way to eat some comforting louisiana soul food, excited to say the least...and HUNGRY!  Upon my arrival I was greeted by a very abrasive, not so friendly waitress who was clearly stressed out, perhaps overworked.  That just killed my good mood and my appetite, almost. LUCKILY, things turned around for me and my hungry belly.  The waitress and I worked through our differences and I focused on what I was going to eat while she took her time seating me.  Anyhow, the service isn't wait I came there for, the food was and it was AMAZING! The grits we so creamy, some of the best I've tasted, the biscuits look just like they do in the picture.  I also had the creole omelette and it was infused with flavor and fluffyness.  OH, and you must try the chocolate beignets, mmmmm good!! Caution, it is very small in  there and very drafty/  If it weren't for that and the service, I would have given it 5 stars.

SOUL FOOD TO DIE FOR, GO TO HEAVEN, AND THEN COME BACK TO EARTH!!!! A treasure in the tenderloin neighborhood. a dime in the dozen. and a dimond in the rough. This place has become my happy sensation when i think of the food i've experienced. I came here for the first time last week on Easter Sunday and found me a great spot to eat. We read the reviews before coming here of recommendations of what to order, the wait but the worth of it. what really got my support was the chef/owner is PINAY who is down for the french soul food cooking (absolutely loving it!) we rushed ourselves here only to find about fifteen people waiting infront of us (outside) and a list (where we were at the very bottom). i didn't mind the wait, the only thing that bothered me was starring at everyone inside eating. if your wondering about the price, super affordable with the portions you get and the taste to go along with it. First thoughts - those people inside need to hurry up and get out so i can get in. every person walking out has left overs! We waited about 40 minutes. walked in, since we were outside starring at the menu and specials, we knew right away what to order... helps keep the people shuffling in and out of this place. we ordered alot of food because we wanted to try everything. We knew first off we were going to get some Gumbo. It's funny, my mom has made gumbo before but she's from the Philippines so I always call it "filipino gumbo" and never really thought anyone else would make gumba. but at Brenda's, their Chicken Sausage Gumbo was so delicious. see our order below: 1. Watermelon Ice Tea (so good) 2. Bowl of Chicken Sausage and Okra Gumbo (yum to the tenth power) 3. Crawfish with cayenne scallions and cheddar beignets 4. side order of a pancake (huge) 5. Grillades and Grits (with 2 eggs and a biscuit (very hearty and tasty) 6. Cornbeef Hash with 2 eggs and a biscuit (yummy, has a pinch of spiciness) second thoughts - have i died and gone to heaven? why did i order this... i should have ordered much more because i want to try everything. i wish they told me the dishes can be spicy... duh... it is soul food, there should be spice. ALL TOO GOOD. i can go on and on forever about the watermelon icetea, bumbo, and biscuits. i plan to dip in weekly during the weekdays to get me some good breakfast and i think my order will be the watermelon icetea, gumbo, and a biscuit. oh the biscuits, are you kidding me... it's that good! First timers, quit being lazy, get yourself up and head over here. Yes, wait in line but the better... the more your hungry, the more you can eat. enjoy because you definately will be leaving SOULFUL from this joint. third thoughts - full. why are all our leftovers look like we just walked out of a grocerry store because we have bags full of leftovers. Until the next review...

Come to Brenda's and be prepared to get your grub on. Expect big portions of hearty French and Creole fare in a tiny cafe. Expect to rub elbows with your neighbor. Launching right into the food.. do try the flight of beignets, a dish of New Orleans' style donuts, a warm comfort food perfect on a foggy day in SF. The crawfish beignet was definitely the star of the dish, a melt in your mouth experience of savory crawfish, scallions, and creole spices. Who would've known that savory flavors work well in a donut? The apple cinnamon, chocolate, and plain beignets were delightful as well. The flavors are what you'd expect. My only issue - i think the beignets could use more filling. For breakfast: I had the creole veggie omelet with corn maque choux (spicy corn), tomato, onion, peppers, spinach, and cheese. The omelet was tasty, although not much elaboration is needed. The biscuit was buttery and moist, and larger than the size of my fist! (Do try them with the fresh fruit jam!) The grits were really what caught me by surprise.. an amalgam of porridge, cheese, and butter. I'll admit it, it was probably the most unhealthy bowl of grits I've ever eaten.. but also oh so yummy. For lunch (on a different day that is): I ordered the catfish po'boy sandwich, a concoction of a french roll lined with lettuce, chipotle sauce, tomato, and the fried catfish. All I can say was that it was a simple sandwich that satisfied my craving for some carbs and some fried food. I haven't tried enough po'boy sandwiches to tell how Brenda's compare. But delicious it was! It's true that the wait can be discouraging, but I really do think that people should try the food there, at least once! If you're really bothered by the wait time, just arrive early. Get to Brenda's door before 10am, especially on weekends. A bonus: the waitresses are very friendly, and they show their appreciation for your business. Like I said, go get your grub on!

I couldn't pass up Brenda's French Soul Food on this recent trip to SF, because of the 1000+ reviews. 1000! And their homepage has a picture of biscuits! http://www.frenchsoulfoo…. I had to see for myself what all the hubbub was about, Bub. It was a Monday morning, around 9:30, so we just parked around the corner and walked right in. There were only a couple of tables seated. Maximum occupancy showed 40, but I think that probably includes the staff. There's a counter along the wall that seats about 8 on stools, a couple of tables in the middle for fours and some along the other wall. I ordered the french toast ($7) and a side of potato hash. DK had the andouille and cheddar omelette ($10), which came with potato hash and a biscuit on the side. My french toast consisted of 6 halves, and was good french toast. Nothing to write home about. The omelette was awesome though, as was the biscuit. I probably could've just eaten that biscuit and been done for the day. It was crispy goodness on the outside, browned to perfection and warm and buttery on the inside. We ordered the flight of beignets ($7), which consisted of four: plain, chocolate, crawfish and apple. I was not impressed by these, as the outer shell was tough on all of them and hard to cut through. The chocolate is deadly rich and sweet, the plain was very plain, the apple was like an apple pie and the crawfish was the tastiest except my mouth was on fire after a bite. I like the beignets at Just For You waaaaay better. I also had a glass of the sweet watermelon iced tea and it was good, and not too sweet, but I could probably make it at home. I would not come here if there was a wait. It's really not all that I expected it to be. But I do like coming to the Tenderloin and seeing all the interesting people there.

Brenda's serves some pretty great southern hospitality home cooked food. The flavors are great, the restaurant is cozy, they have some amazing biscuits, some okay beignets, but some rocking bacon eggs and spicy sausages. The omlettes are pretty great as well as the croque monsieur but all in all this place seems a bit more like an over hyped diner. Don't get me wrong, diners don't mean don't go there, but above the dismally numerous combinations you can do with some bacon, eggs, potatoes, biscuits, veggies, and herbs - the only thing that sets Brenda's apart are availability of some grits and beignets. Oh and there's no line at the diners, I can't say the same for Brenda's. =/

I literally waited MONTHS in anticipation to come here.  Everytime I attempted to though, plans would fail.  Perhaps the long build up ultimately doomed this place in my eyes as my expectations and yearning rose.   Came here at 8am on a Sunday morning and there wasn't a line.  SCORE.  I was hungover so Brenda's would naturally seem to be the perfect cure.  Unfortunately, got sat at the counter, which was super small and uncomfortable.  Small pittance to pay for some southern comfort breakfast.   So on I ordered, starting with a cup of Chicken, Sausage, and Okra Gumbo and the Housemade Granola Pancakes while my friend got the Beignet Flight and some special dish.  The Gumbo was delicious.  I'm usually not the biggest fan of gumbo cause places over-season it and it just kinda hurts to eat.  But this was perfect, and with a dash of hot sauce just popped.  The proteins were tender and the okra tasted fresh.  The pancakes were another story.  I LOVE me some granola pancakes.  The key to good ones though is they have to be moist.  These were not.  It was like eating granola without milk along with a dry dry pancake.  Liberal dousings of syrup and vanilla sauce were needed to make it palatable, along with washings of milk.  Once again, dry foods had come to bite me in the ass.   As for the beignets.  I have mixed feelings on them.  The crawfish was my favorite, but on a plate of dough-y sweet treats, it was an odd inclusion, though understandable.  I just wish it had more crawfish in it.  The plain was my next favorite as it went perfectly with the jar of strawberry preserves that they leave for everybody.  The apple and chocolate ones were whatever to me.  They just tasted like very fluffy and VERY sweet donuts.  Tasty sure, but I could go to a donut shop and accomplish the same thing.   I wish I could say that I loved the meal, but I just felt underwhlemed and didn't find myself saying I want more of this at the end.  Since the pancakes were the biggest and main part of the meal, they really made or broke it.  And they broke it.  Maybe I'll give it another shot one day, but not right now, cause she ain't gon tie me down.

Brenda...Brenda...Brenda...Come to LA please... ;) Me and my friends came at around 11ish and we were seated about 30-40 minutes after we wrote our name down. Parking was not hard to find, but pricey...$3/hour...wowzaa...well anyways, here's our overall experience. The waiter/hostess was nice enough to exchange our dollars to coins for parking (metered, street parking) The writing our names down on a chalkboard "door" line-system was cute and different.. Two out of the three waitresses who were working were extremely nice and helpful... The other one was the one who exchanged our dollars for coins, she definitely looked serious & focused...... hahah I love the high ceiling and the nakedness of the concrete wall with the mural on it. FOOD: We ordered: Crawfish Beignets - The cayenne pepper on top really balances the inside (cheesy crawfish) Hangtown Fry - This oyster-bacon scramble was really good and tasty! Cornmeal Fried Catfish Po'Boy - Our waitress recommended the oyster but since we already ordered the oyster scrambled, we decided to get the crawfish, and no regrets! The crawfish was gooooooodd... Even the bread just by itself was extremely tasty... :D Bananas Foster French Toast - It was one of the Specials on the Board, and it was soft and sweet but not too sweet (well at least for me) and the cream was just airy and light... Our three-party table paid about $15/person which I thought was extremely worth it. Four thumbs up! WE WILL FOR SURE COME BACK AGAIN...!

Brenda's is seriously amazing.   Everything I had here was delicious, and the best part was that we didn't have to wait at all.   It definitely helped that we went on a Wednesday at 11am...if you're planning on going over the weekend, heed the Yelp warning and expect a long wait.  Don't be discouraged though, the wait is soooo worth it! Start off with the Watermelon Sweet Tea, it's so refreshing and the watermelon flavor is really intense.  The real must-haves here though are the Beignets... specifically the Crawfish Beignets.  OMG who knew crawfish could taste so good?  I was initially skeptical about the savory style doughnut but trust me, these babies are the BEST out of all the beignets available.  The Apple and Chocolate Beignets are pretty tasty too... We got the Beignet sampler platter, and even split between three people it was a good amount of food...I was actually kind of full after the Beignets.  This didn't stop me from ordering another dish, the Fried Oyster and Bacon Scramble which came with a buttery Biscuit or toast, and Grits or Potato Hash.  I had the biscuit and grits, both were filled with buttery goodness...make sure to ask for the house made strawberrty jam for you Biscuit or toast though, so good. The egg scramble was delicious, and don't worry, they don't play games here and they are not stingy with the oysters.  There were at least 5 big ones in my eggs and a ton of bacon. My dining partners tried the Goat Cheese Omelette and the Peach Cobbler Pancakes (SO GOOD).  I don't usually like ordering pancakes at restaurants because I'm always afraid that they might not be enough food... that is so not the case with these pancakes.  The two HUGE pancakes are filled with chunks of peaches and come with a delicious creme fraiche spread for the top.  SRSLY amazing. Everything here was so good and very reasonably priced.  For three people with Beignets + 3 dishes + 3 sweet teas, it was only $47 before tip/tax.  So... come here, come early, leave happy.

I know that all my friends adore this place, but frankly I am just not a big fan.  The food is mediocre.  The gumbo was too salty.  The fried oyster po boy was very oily and I was not feeling the sauce.  The crawfish beignets I had were good, but it is not anything that would make me want to come again and again.   Of course after reading tons of reviews on this place, I also ordered their watermelon iced tea.  I really do not see what the big deal was.  The reviews made it seem as if it was an elixir straight from the gods.  It just tasted like boring iced tea with a hint of watermelon.  I still find a glass of pure watermelon juice more refreshing.  Given the wait, its just not worth it IMHO.  Since Brenda's has a cult following, I'm sure my review would not change anything.

Finally ate here today!  Even though it was cold and rainy in SF, G and I hoped that perhaps the wait won't be so long this morning when we got to Brenda's around 10:20ish.  We waited for about 15 minutes and were seated at the counter.  Had to have their two specials today: pumpkin pie pancakes, the shrimp grits with cheddar and bacon-tomato relish.  We also had a flight of beignets. All the portions were a bit on the heavy side.  Since we were undecided, we got the flight of beignets--plain, granny smith apples with cinnamon honey butter, chocolate, and the crawfish with scallions and cheddar.  Each beignet was huge.  I chanced it and ate a piece of the crawfish beignet. The plain was alright, the granny smith was nice, and the chocolate was splendid.  I think a bite of each would've sufficed my craving for the beignet, but each portion was definitely good for 2-3 people to share.  THe entire flight would've satisfied 5 people. The pumpkin pie pancakes with the vanilla cream cheese spread was delicious.  I have to say, however, that the star of today's dishes was the flavorful TOMATO in the tomato-bacon relish that is used on the shrimp grits.  The grits were mad cheesy.  I really enjoyed this dish. G and I also had the refreshing watermelon sweat tea (not too sweet, which was cool).   Brunch ended up being a bit more pricey than I had anticipated, even if we didn't order the flight of beignets.  They can definitely scale back on prices and portion sizes and I would have been just as satisfied. =8)

Trying to get seated here was a very interesting series of events. For a party of 5 (hehe "party of five") the wait was a whomping TWO HOURS. But I guess that's okay since you can spend those two hours exploring the beautiful city of San Francisco! However, if you're a local then um yea, bring a book or something. I think I'm more in love with the idea of French Soul food rather than the actual taste. Yes, the crawfish beignet is the epitome of innovative fusion between two different food genres but they weren't anywhere near the greatest thing that I have ever eaten. Why? Not enough crawfish Brenda, not enough crawfish. Prices are actually pretty cheap; my gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelet was under $10 and pretty freaking delicious. You get to pick two sides so I went with grits and biscuit. Grits are grits but that biscuit was so crumbly and buttermilky, lizzy like. Even with the 2 hour wait and over-hyped crawfish beignets, Brenda still deserves 4 stars. Why? Because she serves fancy down to earth food for a reasonable price. Plus that goat cheese shrimp omelet was pretty bomb. Anyways, ya'll should try the crawfish beignets anyway just in case of the possibility that I came on a bad day.

Sinfully delicious food, in a cardic arrest inducing way. When you feel like throwing caution and sensible eating habits to the wind, this is the place to go. The sweet beignets are super yummy - I enjoy the cinnamon apple over the chocolate, but they are both winners. The gumbo is especially excellent - these folks know how to make an authentic roux. Their watermelon sweet tea spawns an addiction befitting The Loin. The portions are generous so come hungry or share. Seating is crowded and it's usually pretty noisy inside - so not the best ambiance. But hey, it's all about the food. If you go on the weekend, pull up some concrete and prepare to wait (at least an hour if you go during prime time brunch hours.) On the plus side, parking is ample on the weekend and prices are very reasonable.

Two things get a restaurant a great rating from me - amazing food, amazing service.  I don't care how ridiculously to die for your food is, if the service is not good the food almost turns to ash in my mouth!   I was the out-of-towner who came with the in-towner.  We knew the wait was going to be for at least an hour and a half, and I was told it would be well worth it.  The wait was almost 2 hours.  First of all, they really need to alter/streamline that chalkboard sign in system.  It's all willy-nilly and the host seems to get mixed up on where he ended and where the next name begins.  We definitely got overlooked which made our wait time about 20 mins longer.   Ok - so with that said, starving, 2 hours later, you FINALLY sit.  You smile, read the menu that looks amazing, smell the food around you - and at this point, everyone typically forgets how long they just waited.   The food comes - shrimp and grits for my sister, which was amazing, and I got a fried oyster scramble.  It was all delicious to be sure.  Watermelon tea is definitely the drink to get.   But my God, our server.  We just waited 2 hours to eat this food and eventually tip you, and she comes and worsens the experience!  Probably she had a bad day, who knows.  She was short and borderline rude.  So instead of giving this place a 5, I'm giving it a 3.

It's really busy on a Sunday at 9.30am - to me that's a good sign, even if it's slightly annoying when you're a hungry pregnant woman. It's worth the wait though - we loved the food, service was quick and attentive and the place is super cute. We didn't try the beignet, which was probably a mistake, but hey...it's just a reason to go back! My husband tried the pulled pork benedict (in error, he actually asked for the pork belly but the waitress misheard him and when the pulled pork showed up he went with it) and thoroughly enjoyed it, along with his mimosa. I had the french toast with butter pecan sauce - no amount of sugar is enough for me at the moment - it was delicious! We followed a tip from some fellow patrons and having put our name down we headed to Philz around the corner for a great coffee while waiting.

I can never quite make it to brunch on Saturday.  I am just a Sunday brunch kinda gal.  I distinctly remember that Brenda's used to be closed on Sundays (blasphemy!).  However, I noticed on their website that they are open on Sunday now.  You rock, Brenda! While standing out on the sidewalk, we drooled over the specials listed on the chalkboard.  Surprisingly, the wait was only about five minutes for two people.  I have heard this isn't always the case so we must have been extra lucky that day.   The beignets were definitely going down.  In order to get a taste for them all, we ordered the beignet flight. It's hard to go wrong with beignets but Brenda's are UNIQUE and TASTY...four different pillows of deliciousness.  My absolute favorite was the savory crawfish beignet packed with crawfish, cheddar & scallions with a generous dusting of cayenne.  It was my first experience ever with crawfish and I can't wait to try more.  My brunch date enjoyed the Ghirardelli chocolate best which is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth.   After asking for a recommendation from our friendly server, I had the andouille & cheddar omelet w/potato hash and a cream biscuit which was just as amazing as it sounds. He had the french toast w/warm, buttery toasted pecan sauce which he raved about.  I was too full to steal a bite off his plate like I normally would.  After the beignets, we both agreed that we were already kind of full.  We rallied enough to eat about half of our entrees anyway. For next time, the plan is to get the beignets (A MUST HAVE!) and share an entrée.  As far as prices go, it's actually quite reasonable.  Our meal with two drinks, two entrees & a beignet flight ran about $42 including a generous tip. And believe me folks...it's worth every penny.

Beignet sampler - FCUKING delish and a delightful treat Cup of gumbo - YUM cup of chicken etouffe - can i say yum yum in a cup? braised beef - not my favorite dish. Though hearty the beef was really t ough shrimp and grits - OMG heaven watermelon ice tea - refreshing so so refreshing I am now addicted to beignets and am in need of some rehab. The sampler is HUGE (ha thats what she said giggity) and pretty much shared amongst 5 ppl. We just cut them to share. The gumbo was good but can I just say the etouffe was just scrumpcious. The shrinp and grits stole the show though because I seriously could not believe that such a simple dish could provide such happiness in a dish. The braised beef was a hearty plate that had grits, biscuit, 2 sunny side eggs, and gravy. The meat was not tender at all and pretty hard to chew. I was so glad that the watermelon ice tea was there to wash all that yummy goodness down though. MAN I am craving some brenda's right about now. D'OH! I forgot to mention the service. The place is always busy so service can be crazy, but our server was pretty cool at letting us know that we ordered just a bit too much food HAHAHHHAAHA!!! She did seem annoyed though I guess overwhelmed?

This is the BEST brunch place in SF.   Yes, you have to put your name on a list.  And yes, you're probably going to wait about an hour.   And yes you're waiting outside of the KFC in the 'loin.   But once you're inside.  Ahhh, heaven.  Amazing southern-inspired food that us west coasters rarely have the luxury of finding.   Homemade biscuits that melt in your mouth?  Check.  Fried catfish eggs benedict with creole hollandaise?  Check.  Flight of beignets  including apple and chocolate? Check. Do not leave without getting the beignet flight.  Seriously. The only bummer at Brenda's is if you need to use the restroom.  You practically have to crawl across the griddle to get there.  But... that's SF cute and cozy.

I went on a weekday and even though many people were waiting, we got sitted really quickly. The indoor decoration is a plus! one side looks more urban and the other more country sided. I orded a cheese and suausage omlette which was really tasty but a litttle too much cheese for my taste. It was my first time there, so my date and I ordered the beignets with each favors. We ate the crawfish first and it was SO good! its like perfect amount of spicy and sweet and crispy! crawfish is definitely the best! Chocolate one wasnt too bad. but I didnt really like the sweet tomato one. My date ordered a veggie tofu burger which I think it tasted just okay. Overall the other food wasnt suprisingly tasty but the crawfish beignets will make me want to go back again and again!

I seem to recall hearing that cows have four stomachs. On Saturday I was wishing I was a cow because I seriously wanted to try half of the brunch menu. Reluctantly I settled on one entree--more on that later. First, the GF and I split an order of crawfish beignets. WARNING: these suckers are big, and there's three of them. They're almost a meal just by themselves. Just FYI. Oh, and they were fantastic. For the entree my GF had the fried chicken benedict and she loved it. I had the special pork belly with cheese grits, and....holy crap. Words do not suffice. I would've been speaking in tongues if I could've stopped shoveling food in my face long enough to make a sound. Simply deliciousl So why, you may ask, am I not giving them five stars? Is it the service? Nope, service was very nice (20 minute wait after arriving a little after 12 noon--I'm fine with that). Much to my dismay, the Cajun Bloody Mary or whatever they called it was a total disappointment. If you're like me and you like your Bloody Marys strong and spicy, these are not them. Instead, it was surprisingly bland, both in terms of spice and alcohol content. Maybe it was a bad batch, but I was expecting something to blow my socks off and unfortunately my socks remained on. Still, I highly recommend this spot. Go hungry and leave happy.

Brenda's is a must if you want to have a unique, flavorful meal with a French/Creole feel. There is always a wait, but its worth every minute. The staff is polite and will give you a cup of coffee while you wait. My friend and I split the beignets sampler plate. We got four large beignets; plain, chocolate, apple and crawfish. Next time I am just going to get the crawfish beignets. They were so savory and covered in a great blend of cajun spices. For my entree I got the goat cheese and shrimp omelet. The goat cheese was creamy and the caramelized onions were sweet and balanced the cheese well. I got the potatoes, instead of the grits and the potatoes were a classic hash. I also got the biscuit and it was large and buttery. I took most of my entree home, but I would've ordered all of that food again, but maybe next time I will just get one beignet. :)

Saw the high ratings on yelp and decided to eat here for breakfast, luckily there was no line. My friend and I order beignet fight-- we ate 2/4 and was full already. I would recommend the oyster, it taste the best. For entree we order Grillades  and grits-- first time trying grits, if you're not a big fan of oatmeal I wouldn't recommend this.  However my friend order bacon and omelette and it was delicious. the watermelon sweet ice tea taste exactly like the name itself, watermelon and ice tea, but I would prefer water instead. Overall, the food was good and service was good :)

Still amazing but now I want to talk to the woman herself. Brenda actually thanked me for this review and that makes me feel all warm and tingly inside. I love that a restaurant owner even cares THAT much. I've eaten the food that this woman cooks with her very hands and it is the most tasty shit i've ever had in my life. i continually bring peeps here b/c they must know what love tastes like. Thank you Brenda for being awesome and for knowing that the best places don't need to be grandiose! I'm so glad I don't live in the city other wise I would be a fat cow.

Brenda's is an instant classic for me. The Hometown Fry, a dish of oyster, bacon and egg scrambled, gave me the jitters man.  It was that good! I had the hash option with my dish, which was griddle fried red potatoes. The hash was good, but the grits option was just as tasty. The grits had the right balance of fat and salt, giving this usually bland dish the right touch. The biscuit that came with the Hometown Fry deserves its own paragraph.  It's the best damn biscuit I've ever had so far. It was light, fluffy and the perfectly baked golden crust reminds me of a scrumptious egg tart shell.  I suggest that you smother that bad boy with some of Brenda's delicous jam. Oh... Like I was done. I also split a Shrimp Po-boy with my buddy. Another delicous sandwich, consisting of fried shrimp, shredded lettuce and sauce. Although, the fries that came with the Po-boy was standard, my stomach couldn't accommodate anymore food, so I passed on some of the fries. Brenda's is a small restaurant, so I suggest you keep party sizes no larger than 4 people. The servers are nice and they keep your glasses of water and Sweet Watermelon Tea filled. Although, I did have to wait about 10 minutes to get seated and another 15 minutes for the food to arrive, I thought the food was worth the wait. Mmm so much soul... makes me wanna sing out like James Brown... "Oww, I feel good!"

I had a spectacular breakfast here. The waitress was so sweet and attentive. I ordered the hangtown fry and my husband got the fried oyster po boy. Everything was great, but since I love side dishes my favorites were as follows: -crawfish beignet -watermelon iced tea -buttery grits -biscuit with homemade strawberry jam. Although the wait for a table can be discouraging, when you have food like this it doesn't really matter that you waited a long time for a seat or that you are squished up at the counter next to a stranger. It's all worth it and everyone leaves with a fat belly and big smile.

Brenda's was the talk of the town at work, so I finally caved in and gave it a try the other day.  And boy, was I ever glad I did.  I found me a new place to dine! Parking was a bit a pain in the butt, but was able to find one after searching for a few minutes. Brenda's is a very small restaurant to dine in and I was expecting to wait for a table.  They have you write your name and number in your party on the chalkboard, which I thought was pretty unique.  When we were writing our names down, we actually got seated right away. So many good choices to choose from and I just wanted to sample everything off the menu.  But I went with my gut instinct and gave the Beignet Flight a try and I was glad that i did.  The Beignet Flight was a sampler plate of all their Beignets.  It had a crawfish, chocolate, plain and a apple one.  Overall, I have to say my favorite was the crawfish and chocolate.   My bf had the Andouille Sausage and Cheddar Omelette with a biscuit.  I was able to sample a bite of it and it was pretty darn good. Defintely will be back to try more of their food items.

This discovery was DEFINITELY worthy of an update.  While Brenda's doesn't serve alcohol (read: no mimosas for this lush).....  they let you bring champagne and offer half glasses of OJ to accommodate said fantastic breakfast beverage!!!   That's what I'm talking about! *clink*  Cheers!!!!!!

Brenda you have done the impossible. You have made me a breakfast person. You have literally made me eagerly await morning. My tastebuds go into complete submission and the only way I could drool more is if I had a balll gag. Seriously, there have been plenty of times my eyes and stomach are screaming no and my mouth just can't help itself. And being the fickle vixen you and your staff are seeing the blackboard outside makes this one of the highlights of my day. The sweet potato pancakes and peach cobbler pancakes with the vanilla sauce-dessert as a meal. Molasses pork chops with sweet potato hash--delightful and just as good with scarmbled eggs as its is with sunny side up eggs. Your potatoes remind me of Thanksgiving stuffing but I don't have to wait until November anymore! The eggs benedict and chicken with goat cheese omlette--a little rich for me but I am not a quitter and slowly but surely I ate it all. But no you don't stop there.... Lunch is also wonderful. Chicken ettoufee, jambalaya, catfish po' boys--all delicious and gobbled right up. Thank you for feeding me so many times. You and all your staff have given me one more reason to not to go grocery shopping.

I was really excited to eat here when I first heard about this place.  Be prepared to wait for at least half an hour if you're coming in for brunch, even if it's a Monday. Oh, and make sure you have plenty of meter money ready. I tried the Beignet Flight as an appetizer.  The crawfish one was the best, too bad there was only one of them. I feel like thats the only thing worth going back for. The chocolate and apple beignet was to sweet for me while the plain beignet could just easily be forgotten. I ordered an omelet as my appetizer and had the watermelon iced tea, nothing spectacular in my opinion. This place didn't awe me, but it's worth a try.  By the way, the are expanding and have on going construction so it can be bit noisy in there.

My parents are from Louisiana, and given that most of the good Southern soul food restaurants in San Francisco have closed, I am always a bit skeptical of establishments purporting to serve America's first indigenous food cuisine (well, post European-settlement). So, based on some buzz I heard from friends and yelp and decided to check out the hype. Let's see how it does on the KW checklist 1. Outward Appearance, in a divy location - check 2. Long wait for a table - check 3. Intimate (read small) ambiance - check 4. Good Service - check 5. Great food - check Yes, it's a 5 for 5 on the list of a great dinning experience. Located in a real neighborhood of SF, not an uber-hyped gentrified part of San Francisco, it is worth the trip and the wait for a table. Yes, the wait - I waited an hour with a group of friends outside in a light drizzle to get a table for brunch. Was it worth it? The savory beignets were pretty good, but the crawfish beignet was outstanding - as good as I remember from N'Orleans. My main entree was the Hangtown Fry - never have Oysters, a small (just right) amount of Bacon and Eggs tasted so good.  And now that I see from Yelp that you can get biscuits to go, I know how to supplement my fried chicken fixes. I ran into a colleague who runs a major SF City Department while I was waiting and let's just say good word has spread through City Hall about this place.  Go now before it gets totally hijacked by hipsters and friends of Gavin! Ok, I had to knock it down one star because I went on New Year's Day to go for my traditional Collard Greens and Black Eyed Peas meal and the list for seating was closed at 2 pm.  Oh well, it did force me to cook my first-ever New Years Day meal.

Where yat? Probably in line for breakfast. And I'll happily wait there over and over and over. The chicory coffee is just like DuMonde, and is so thick you could stand a spoon up in it. My ratatouille omelet was excellent, and I can't wait to go back to sample the beignets. (Note: an order of beignets is 3, not 1. Silly me) Be warned, you take your life in your hands going to the bathroom through the cramped, grease drenched kitchen. That is, if it doesn't get to your arteries first. When you can't afford to get to NOLA, Brenda's is a nice slice of Big Easy heaven.

Judging by how popular it was, I don't think Brenda's needs another 5 star review, but I had such a wonderful dinner last night that I just can't help myself! As a vegetarian I was a little worried that there wouldn't be much for me to eat but that fear was unfounded, as I found so much delicious food that I stuffed my face so much and don't think I need to eat for another month. The mac and cheese and yams were particularly delicious. I rarely eat fish and am so glad I chose last night to eat the crawfish beignets because I am still drooling thinking about them. Excellent service, excellent food. Thanks Brenda's!!

Let's break this down. Service: Okay - they bring you food. Nothing special here. I'm pretty sure one of the waitresses was offended when I mistakenly interrupted her. Sorry, just wanted to get a watermelon iced tea. Atmosphere: Small, cute, and well small. So it's nicely decorated inside and they have an interesting little chalk board to write your name down and hate the people in front of you. They have a nice celling too, I saw that DIY on HGTV. It's worth noting this is not the best part of town. Nor is parking great. Damn the good food here (see next section) Food: well this is pretty much why you wanted to read this far right? Everything I had here, from the Shrimp & Cheese Grits (MUST GET THESE) to the Beignet flights or the Po' Boy Sandwiches...was amazing. Melt in your mouth amazing. Oh Brenda, oh Brenda...you make me fat. Well your delicious food and my poor life choices.

This place was totally worth the one hour wait, seriously.  I was a bit ambitious and got the apple beignets, which were delicious, and the andouille cheddar omelet with grits and a biscuit, which definitely did not disappoint.  My friend and I even made conversation with the party next to us.  Seeing them salivate over their food only shows that you can't fake pleasure like that.   I'm sad I didn't get a chance to try the gumbo but that's what next time's for right?  My friend had the grillades which taste like Filipino caldereta, perhaps a take on the chef's part Filipino roots?  In any case, the food is insanely good.  Go there.  Just do it.

There are so many good things to say about Brenda's. 1. the coffee - they use this special chicory infused coffee from Louisiana that's so delicious I was gulping it down. And I'm not a regular coffee drinker - I really only have coffee at brunch once or twice a month. It's really, really delicious with lots of sugar and cream (from a super cute little long spouted creamer) 2. the crawfish beignets are amazing. spicy but only while you're eating them. you know, a flavorful heat, not the kind of spice that flavors the rest of your meal and makes you blow on hot things for too long because you don't want them to hurt. 3. the biscuits. so fluffy you'll want to make a bed out of them and eat yourself to sleep. the apple spice house jam is the jam yo. 4. the egg and bacon tartine was really awesome. highly buttered slice of french bread, grilled, topped with two slices of bacon, probably four eggs scrambled (maybe only three but it was a lot of delicious scrambled egg!), topped with melted gruyere and a bacon tomato relish that had a flavor I've never experienced before. tomato relish is a brilliant idea on its own but then you add crumbled bacon and you're on the road to culinary heaven.   5. the andouille saugage omellete had this amazing sauce that was worth the price of admission (did I really just type that? sigh, I've been reading too many yelp reviews).  I only had a bite of this because it was my man's dish and I was happily working on my own dish but it was a tasty delicious bite.  He said it was good but the eggs benedict with cajun hollandaise and molasses ham that he'd had previously was outta this world and came on one of their biscuits. We were there around 10ish on a chilly Sunday, were only two and only had to wait about 10 minutes.  And, our bill was only about $30 after tip.  Totally worth the wait (if there is one) and the trip to the Tenderloin.

The Good: The idea of New Orleans style Creole cooking Watermelon Ice Tea- sweet, the way Southern ice tea is supposed to be, fresh watermelon juice gave a nice refreshing touch Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette- I think this is one of those 'you either love it or hate it' dishes with the shrimp and goat cheese mix...I'm a fan of goat cheese so this definitely appealed to me.. Banana Foster French Toast- perfectly cooked french toast topped with fresh caramelized banana's, yum Andoille Sausage and Cheddar Omelette- good! Bisquits- flaky and moist Southern style bisquits!! The Bad: Possibly a heart-attack waiting to happen, not that I've ever let that deter me... 1/+ hour wait on weekend, not cool :| and The Ugly: To the Marina yuppies/yuppettes, don't expect the usual Sunday brunch people-watching...location- Tenderloin, nuff' said

Went here for dinner before the symphony after cancelling a reservation at J'ardiniere where I was expecting to spend over $200 for my wife and I.  God I'm sooo glad I did. We started with the Oyster Flight which was AMAZING (especially the Tchoupitoulas) and split one Crawfish Beignet (we should've gotten 2!).  We sat back smiling after this and remarked how happy we were that we came here instead. And then...  the Shrimp & Grits came.  It's no exaggeration for me to say that this may be the most perfect food I've ever had in my life.  No joke.  I ate it like it was an illegal substance that could get taken away at any minute or something.   When the bill came, it was $45.  I felt like I was ripping them off.  Anyway, 3 days later I'm still thinkin about this place, it's that good!

I had high expectations and the dishes we ordered were, indeed, tasty.  But the service was dismissive.  When we sat down, we were offered beverages and I said coffee.  It didn't come. When we were served our dishes, still no coffee.  But when I asked the waitress who brought our dishes to us, she told me "hold on" and didn't come back.  I had to ask again.  I guess what was not so cool was the attitude.  When I finally got the coffee, not even a "sorry".  Yikes.  Not likely to return.

Worth the 35 minute wait with a hungry whining 12 year old who kept saying "can't we just eat at KFC, it'll be just as good?" After the beignets and catfish poboy he said, "You were right.  That is the best sandwich I've had in my whole life. I can't believe I'm admitting you were right."   This place rocks.   Damn the biscuits are good too.  And I missed the crawfish-andouille pot pie special.  Oh, and good and real cafe au laits.

Sweet, now there are two places in San Francisco to get  beignets!  I didn't try the plain beignets, so I can't compare them to Just For You, but the crawfish beignets (dusted with cayanne and stuffed with scallions, cheddar, and crawfish) were great.  The gumbo's flavor was excellent, too, but a little thin.  I just prefer a thicker, heartier gumbo (more roux-y, I suppose.) The only thing I didn't like was the way they called me 'honey', which I understand is a nice, homey affectation, but seems really inappropriate coming from these girls who are like ten years younger than me.  Damn, when did I get so old? Anyhow, it was very good.  Four stars instead of five because I'll have to go back again to make sure they are consistently excellent. Too bad it's not open on the weekend -- Brenda's would make a fantastic place for Sunday Brunch.

Oh man, I'm glad we finally made it to the city at a time when this place was open. After having seen it reviewed often and positively, I had to try it. I had shrimp and grits, which were amazing.

Do you ever wake up early on a Saturday morning at 7am and think WTF? Shortly followed by breakfast hunger? Well thats exactly what happened here and I remembered my cousin mentioned this place. The restaurant itself is very small but at 8:30am, you won't have a problem with crowds. The people who worked there were extremely friendly and helpful. We had: Granny Smith Apple, with cinnamon honey butter Beignet -surprisingly good since I don't like sweets. -loved how the outside was crunchy -powdered sugar on top was a nice touch. Creole Veggie Omelette -didn't like how they couldn't accommodate to not having no onions. -came with biscuit and potatoes Watermelon Ice Tea -wasn't really a fan but could see how people who love watermelon could. I'm looking forward to see what else this place has to offer in future visits.

Gosh Brenda-how I still love thee, let me count the ways... 1. No wait at 2:00 p.m. on a Friday. Score! 2. You've brought me back to life after losing my appetite for two days due to eating at Fortune Star. 3. Your watermelon iced tea is enough to satisfy my need for 64 oz. of liquids needed daily. I've had an entire large mason jar of this stuff and I have no shame about it. It's so light and fresh, with a delicious hint of sweet watermelon that it makes me crave the stuff year round. 4. Beignets are the best around and I've had a full year of bouncing from restaurant to restaurant to find the best. They're fresh, hot, sweet, kind of messy but paired with the fresh jam on each table, they become the ambrosia of the gods. Doughnut makers should weep and then take notes from this woman because her doughnuts can bring a (wo)man to their knees. 5. The braised ribs in cheddar was unfortunately swimming in oil and huge globs of fat so for the first time, I didn't fully enjoy my meal. It came out piping hot out the oven, swimming on a layer of cheese layered on top of cheddar grits with a lovely sunny side egg cooked just right. While about 1/4 of the ribs were pure gristle, the rest were deliciously paired with grits and was balanced with the iced tea. I had to spoon a lot of the grease out unfortunately and had to spot eating halfway. Oh well, you still have my love Brenda!

Everything we ordered was delicious! BIG portions!! I only ate one of the eggs benedicts and one beignet, and my tummy was about to burst! We also ordered the sweet watermelon tea!! It was so refreshing, especially during an 80 degree day!! Next time I'm back, I really want to try the granola pancakes with vanilla ice cream and ginger butter!!! O_O yummm! The place is very tiny! They open at 8am and people were already putting their names down before that!! So if you are planning to eat here on the weekends, get there at 8am or expect to wait! I wished they opened at 6am!!! Oh, they are also on the list of 100 places to eat in SF before you die, but I think the item was fried shrimp po' boy for lunch. haha

I wasn't as impressed by their pumpkin pancakes or their breakfast options but we did get to try their sampler of Beignets which includes the Craw fish, chocolate, apple cinnamon and plain. I thought the craw fish was amazing and so was the chocolate. I also had their watermelon juice ([people here like to call it watermelon tea but that's not what it is as their is no tea in the drink) which was very refreshing at the time. We managed to get there on a Friday morning without waiting more than 5-10min. The place is rather small but everything is fresh and smells good. I'm not a big breakfast person so I'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and lunch options once we move back into the city next week.

Met a friend for an early lunch around 11:45 on a Tuesday. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, probably worse on the weekends but they seemed to be very efficient. I ordered a creole veggie omelette with grits and a biscuit, my friend ordered the jambalaya with andouille and chicken, and we got a beignet flight. The apple beignet was boring, but the others were great, especially the plain and the crawfish. My omelette was ok, but holy crap the grits and biscuit were amazing! I'm from the South, I miss a good biscuit, and Brenda's is definitely the best I've had in the Bay Area. Wasn't a huge fan of the chicory coffee, next time I'll order an espresso drink. Service was great and it didn't take long to get in and out even though the place was busy.

OMG i'm still in a heavenly food coma! On a beautiful Saturday, there were about 10 parties waiting ahead of us on that giant chalkboard...but my mind was set on Brenda's. We waited for about an hour and a half...and it was the best hour and a half I spent waiting for brunch!! I ordered the fried chicken eggs benedict and it was sooooooooooooo good. I think I stopped talking to my friend 'cause i couldn't concentrate. I couldn't stop eating and thinking about how good my food is. It was a non-greasy piece of fried chicken on top of one of the best, moist, buttery biscuit, topped with poached eggs and sauce. My friend ordered the Hangtown fry which is oyster with scrambled eggs. I thought the scrambled eggs were a tad bit overcooked. But i generally prefer my scramble eggs a little runny. I must thank all the yelpers that yelped this place, otherwise i would never have found it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Any place that presents me with a plate of food that I cannot finish for all the right reasons is a prime candidate for five stars. Today Brenda's presented me with a corned beef hash special.  Half of my plate was scrambled eggs, the other corned beef hash.  There must have been at least three eggs.  They were cooked perfectly.  The hash was a perfect mix of corned beef, potatoes, and caramelized onions.  The side biscuit was a flaky, buttery dream. I kept eating it.  And eating it.  I was full.  I knew I should stop.  But I didn't.  I kept shoveling it into my mouth.  Finally, I had to surrender with a decent amount of food still staring at me.  I rarely suffer these kinds of defeat.

Brought some friends here from NYC to get brunch and I must advise you to COME EARLY! this place is small and gets packed quickly. You have to order their watermelon sweet tea. Not too sweet and a perfect amount of watermelon flavor and very refreshing on a hot summer day. I absolutely loved it and I don't usually drink sweet teas. Another thing that is a must get is their cat fish/ fried chicken eggs' Benedict and their shrimp po boy! Moist, poached egg that's on top is done perfectly. great place for brunch/lunch, but dont' take my word for it. you gotta come here and try it for yourself cause it really is well worth the wait.

I would wake up much too early on a weekend, and wait outside for 40 minutes wearing my San Diego sun dress in freezing San Francisco weather any day if a taste of Brenda's French Soul Food is the outcome!!! Small, cramped location but that's part of the cozy, intimate feel that the place offers. It just wouldn't be the same otherwise. The server was very helpful and didn't make me feel like an utter retard for not knowing what eggs benedict is. I ordered the eggs benedict with catfish (also my first time having catfish)... I cleaned my plate and was stuffed to an uncomfortable capacity. Can't wait to do it again!!! Oh, and the watermelon tea was good too. =)

If you are in need of Soul Searching...this is the place to go! All I have to say is Crawfish Beignets! At first I thought...aren't beignets supposed to be sweet? We ordered the sampler and the Crawfish one ended up being my favorite!! The watermelon iced tea is amazing...i tried to duplicate it for a BBQ I hosted...mine paled in comparison. =P I love love love this place...except for the line...but it is well worth it!! French good is one of my faves and I'm Southern Girl, so I love me some Soul Food!

A gem of a brunch place in the Tenderloin - not exactly what I'd expect from a location surrounded by convenience stores shrouded in metal bars. The wait today was not bad at all, four of us girls showed up and we could have been seated within 10 minutes, but not all of our party was there, so we ended up waiting a half hour, but if not for that, we could have been in the door! The hostess was very nice and understanding about our party not all being there, and she kept checking in with us to see if everyone was there. How nice is that? The inside is very cozy - there's a long bar on the right with some booths and small tables crammed into the dark, woodsy room. It was a little too cramped, as people sitting at the bar had their butts right at your face level if you sat at a table behind them. Appetizing. Our table of four girls went nuts. We ordered: Beignet Flight: The best of the batch was the crawfish one, which oozed cheddar and spice. The worst was probably the apple one, which tasted a bit too overly crispy and hard, as it was overdone. The chocolate was great, and the plain one was delicious with the powdered sugar and the housemade jam on the table. Gumbo: With sausage, chicken, rice, and okra - thick and hearty the way gumbo should be! Not too spicy. Fruit and yogurt parfait with housemade granola: Great granola mix, with slightly tangy yogurt that complemented it. The fruit didn't look very fresh, but tasted fine. Bacon and egg tartine: The tartness of the tomato bacon relish goes very well with the scrambled eggs and melted gruyere on the toasted bread and bacon. The potato hash was great, though slightly cold by the time we received it. Butter pecan French Toast: Amazingly sweet and yummy. Pancakes: Fluffy!! Biscuits: Hands down, the best ever. Fluffy, and savory good with butter and jam. Watermelon iced tea: Subtle flavor, but very good for the thirsty palate. A brunch winner!

This place is tiny! Amazing how many people they can put into one room! The sweets were stronger than the savory, except for the crawfish beignets. Please note one order of those beignets comes with 3 of them, except for the sampler. The cream cheese french toast and sweet potato pancakes were to die for! That pecan syrup glaze, holy lord. Got there at 9:30 am and there was no line. Well worth the visit, but it took them a long time to get our food to my table. Apparently a few others that were seated after us were served before. Minus a star for that.

SPICY! HOT HOT HOT! I'm not big into spicy food but, I'll wait in line for this place to set my tongue on fire.  There is always a line and they close at 3 p.m. but the crawfish beignets are so worth it. Always check the specials out side, other than that, the must haves are the grits, biscuits,  sweet watermelon tea, and any way they prep the deep fried cat fish! The servers are all so nice and don't miss a thing. It's a small restaurant, and it can get cozy but I've never heard it to be to loud since the food is good, no one really talk while they are eating! After that 30 min wait for a seat you'd be scarfing down too.

I'm really torn here cause I want to give this 5 stars...but I just didn't get that 5 star feel.  Yelp you need HALF STARS! Anyways!  First off, This place is TINY!...and I'm talking 8 pounds 6 ounces Baby Jesus tiny.  Because of this there is a wait...not a short one either.  Let me give you the situation, me and friend think we're so brilliant and try to avoid the lunch rush by going in around 10:15am, this is a Sunday it's raining in San Francisco.  We thought for sure the line won't be long...we were wrong!!   People in San Francisco are crazy!...we still ended up waiting an hour for a seat. On to the food, I order 3 items, the Shrimp Poboy, the Crawfish Beignets, and the Watermelon Iced Tea.   Watermelon Iced Tea:  I was really hesitant about ordering the iced tea because you know watermelon has a very settle taste, but HOLY @$#!%# it was AMAZING!  *Two thumbs up* Shrimp Poboy:  One word...FANTASTIC!  The shrimp was delicious, the sauce was awesome and the bread provided a good contrast.  Although I would've preferred a softer warm bread as opposed to the grilled/toasted bread they used.  This also came with your choice of cole slaw or fries.  I chose the cole slaw which was good but nothing special...and if you're expecting the kind of cole slaw you get from KFC...then go back to KFC. Crawfish Beignets:  The texture on these were absolutely perfect.  BUT I will say that I'm probably not as big of a fan of these as others are.  Personally, I felt like there was too much spice on top of them and it kind of overpowered the filling for me.  It was a great starter no doubt, but a little less spice and it might gotten brenda's that 5th star.   The rest of the food I saw looked delicious, I might even try ordering two dishes next time just to try things.  The atmosphere is great, food is totally worth the price and the service was spectacular! If I lived in SF and the wait wasn't so long, I'd think about stopping by here probably at least once or twice a week.   I can't wait to go back!

My first visit to Brenda's was at dinner time. I had: Shrimp Gratin, 1 piece of Fried Chicken, and the Dixie's New Orleans Jazz Amber Ale Lite, AND Beignet Combo! I think the Garlic Shrimp gratin and chicken was a hit. Yummy shrimp with red sauce and garlic bread. The chicken had some real aromatic seasoning, I also sopped the red gratin sauce with chicken too :D New Orleans Jazz Amber Ale was the beer of the night, not too hoppy which was the way I like. Beignet combo included the plain, apple, and Ghirerdelli chocolate. My favorite one was the chocolate. oh my god! The nose-*ucking aroma!  it's so good!!!! try it please.

Alright, here's the lowdown: get here early or come late, cause if you come somewhere in the middle you're going to be waiting longer than it takes a deaf man to learn the fiddle.  Sorry, not a lot rhymes with middle.  Seriously though, if you do come around 12, bring something to eat, maybe a sleeping bag, some extra change of clothes, a good novel (or two...f*ck it bring three just in case), you get the point.   Food here is pretty good though, and I do think it is worth the wait.  Ladies that are expecting should be warned, you might have to have your baby in line.  Great chance for a baby delivery service to open up next door.  Although with your baby, you have to add one more to your party and in my book that means you get the f*ck to the back of the line. All jokes, please no hate mail.

I am as honest as a heartbeat, so believe me when I say that this spot is highly overrated.  I just have no desire to come again- wait or no wait. I had a bit of all four of our plates and the sampler benettes, so here goes my opinion... My dish- The Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelet Grits and Cream Biscuit- The shrimp was not devianed and thus flavorless.  I opted not to have the bacon relish on top so I will be fair and refrain from further commenting about it.  I like my gritts creamier than it was but it was tastey and the buiscutt was pretty good. Watermelon Sweet Tea- Free refills, but they don't really tell you that.  liked it because it was not sweet, and I like water.  It was also luke-warm. The Chalkboard Special, Shrimp Pot Pie- The shrimp was overcooked and rubbery, and the veggies were overcooked and mushy.  Boo Hoo! The Chalkboard Special, Red Beans and Rice- In a true Red Beans and Rice dish, red beans are not suppose to have the consistency of refried beans, plus it was bland.  Boo Hoo! The Oyster Po Boy- They drowned it with that creole sauce that taste like thousand island dressing and hot sauce.  If you are going to brave it you might want to ask for it on the side. The Beloved Sampler Beignets- Hated It!  They were quite heavy and rubbery, not light and fluffy like they should be.  No wonder they stuff it with crap.  If you need your fix, go to "Just For You" on 3rd and 20th in the city. Last thing... I don't think its fair to start off talking about the disorderly service without giving folks the opportunity to see if the food is worth it, but honestly, the two hour wait just  made me furious.  They passed up several adjoining 2 person tables that they could have just sat the 4 of us at.  When we finally suggested they split us up they did not attempt to make us feel validated.  This experience, in no way contributed to my dislike of the food.   I suggest you go as a duo if you are gonna ignore my warning.  Overall if you want creole breakfast in the city go to "Just For You" on 3rd and 20th.

I've been wanting to try this place forever and I finally got to try it on Monday for lunch.  I arrived with my friend around 1:30 and surprisingly only had to wait about half an hour to be seated.  Given it was Labor Day, I was quite surprised...maybe everyone thought it would be closed.   While we were waiting, we  looked over the menu and specials a gazillion times and were staring at what people had ordered, finally deciding on what to order before we were even seated.  After much contemplation and debate, we decided to go for the flight of beignets and crispy shrimp poboy (those two being a no brainer since they're known for those two dishes) and the beef cutlets with gravy, grits, eggs and biscuits (we were debating whether to order the banana french toast or another dish on the special menu).   When we were seated, we immediately ordered.  While I was waiting for our food, I noticed a huge jug of what looked like iced tea which turned out to be their famous watermelon iced tea.  I had ordered a cup of coffee already (which I thought was pretty good...I drink my coffee black so I appreciate a good cup of coffee) so I had my friend order a glass and it was SO good.  I've never had watermelon iced tea and it was so refreshing and yummy!  I love iced tea and watermelon juice so it was genius to put the two together! The beignets came first and boy were they so yummy!  Doughy morsels of goodness!  I would have to say my favorite was probably the apple and the plain with the powdered sugar which was yummy to dip in their fresh jam.  I thought the crawfish was actually very tasty (my friend said it reminded him of a hot pocket but better)!  My least favorite, surprisingly, was the chocolate but it was still good. Our main course came and by then I was starting to feel full but I couldn't stop there.  The poboy was served on a french roll that was perfectly toasted and buttered, loaded with fried shrimps, lettuce and sauce.  It was served with my favorite side, french fries!  I thought the dish was tasty.  The beef cutlet dish was in a heavy gravy like sauce with grits and eggs over easy all on a plate with a buttery, HUGE biscuit next to it.  This is the real deal when it comes to soul food!  It was very flavorful and rich and heavy but what I would imagine breakfast to taste like in the South. Overall, I thought the food was great and worth the wait...although heart attack waiting to happen!  Prices are very reasonable too.  I will definitely visit again...once I work off all that fat!  Haha.

I had a great lunch here with my Best Friend. We waited for 15 to 20min wait to get a table, but instead sat at the counter. As we walked in it was a very very very small place. I think my studio is bigger that this place. We bounced over to the counter, the only thing that we did not like was the mirror, we do NOT like to see ourselves eat its not so sexy when other people are watchin.... The service was pleasant and the food was really really good. We had to get part of our food to go. Later that night Michael started to nibble on the left over and said that the potatoes taste alittle better cold. He was right. I will go back.....

By far my favorite breakfast place in the city.  I have loved everything i've tried at this place.  Only been once since the remodel, but I think the food is just as good as before and the restaurant setup is way better.  I've tried pretty much everything and I'd say go for the crawfish benets and the catfish po' boy (my favorites).  Now open for dinner, which I haven't tried, but I'll be there soon. People will complain about the line on the weekends, but those people don't really deserve to post on yelp.  You're going to wait in line on the weekend for brunch in the city at any good breakfast joint.  Put your name on the list and walk over to Philz' Coffee on Van Ness and hang for a bit and come back.

If you haven't been here this is a place that you must go to. Be prepared to wait a little while before being seated, especially on a weekend. I think our wait was upwards of an hour, but you would expect that from most really good brunch/lunch places in the city. I really can't say enough good things about Brenda's. The name of the restaurant tells you what to expect; some good French soul food, and it did not disappoint. We started off with the Beignet flight. They were all delicious, but I could not believe how good the crawfish one was. Crawfish, cheddar and scallions with cayenne dusted on top. I will return here just to have that again. I opted for a lunch item and got the catfish po'boy sandwich. This has to be one of my favorite sandwiches of all time. Soft and toasted French roll with crunchy fried catfish inside and a chipotle sauce. The fries on the side were above average as well. I want to think that I will try something else next time I go back but I have been craving this sandwich again, so I don't think I would be able to pass it up. My wife is a huge eggs benedict fan so she ordered that. It is made with a creole hollandaise sauce and she really enjoyed it. The only downside is that the restaurant is very small and you are very close to your neighbors, but when the food is this good it really doesn't matter.

We chose this place on merely a whim and a few recommendations -and were certainly not expecting to see a tiny (7 tables!) place sandwiched between a Taco Bell and a laundromat with an eager, hungry CROWD of people milling around outside.  Right off the bat I could see that the wait was going to be over an hour.  We put our names on the list anyway.  Pack mentality! Was it worth it?  I'm not sure.  We ordered too much food, I started feeling nauseous, and that was entirely our own fault.  But I can say this: I would eat their crawfish beignet for breakfast every morning.  I thought their beignet dough was a bit thick for the 'light' fillings (apple and plain) but worked perfectly for the heavier fillings of chocolate and crawfish. By the time we got our main courses (two of them - stupid, stupid, stupid) I was extremely full - head lolling, eyes drooping, stomach bulging full.  But I was still able to discern that the grits were the best damn grits I'd ever had and that my catfish was nicely fried, flavorful, and perfectly complimented by the spicy Creole hollandaise.  The biscuit underneath it, however, was fairly dry and hard. My boyfriend, who doesn't even like Hollandaise, conceded that mine was the better meal.  His shrimp omelette was good, with fresh, fresh shrimp (naturally)... but it had an extremely strong spice in it that made it difficult to eat more than a few bites. I thought this was certainly comfort food - tasty stuff-your-face-to-last-all-day breakfast food, with flavors you don't see in your everyday diner.  But it wasn't worth waiting for it for an hour.  If this place were in my neighborhood, I'd be lobbying for a crawfish beignets to go window.

Like most people, I have wanted to, but avoided Brenda's for ages because I've done the drive by a couple times, and the line never fails to be insane. This place is tiny, and at 10:45am on a Sunday, there were 22 names ahead of me. It was definitely discouraging, but with some luck and determination, we sat down 1.5 hours later (not too bad!). I'd recommend heading to Philz for some great coffee just one block away. I started with the Watermelon Iced Tea. Imagine southern style sweet tea, with watermelon juice. Delicious and unhealthy. Good thing we got the Biegnet flight because I would NEVER in a million years have ordered a crawfish biegnet, especially not when the alternatives were apple or chocolate. And like everyone else mentioned, the crawfish one is the best, probably the best thing out of the entire meal. I started with the chicken gumbo and it was surprisingly good. You can order a cup or a bowl. I wanted something unique to Brendas, so I ordered the chalkboard special, Hangtown Fry - fried oysters in a gigantic fluffy omelet, a hearty side of potatoes and a buttery crumbly biscuit. Don't hate me, but it was just OK... I made a tiny dent into it, and I was still unbearably full. The shrimp po boy was also just ok, and I thought the sauce on top was overwhelmingly rich. The fries were good but nothing special. Maybe southern food isn't really my thing, or maybe I just need some time to detox, but I felt the food was too overwhelmingly rich and feel like I could have gotten more bang for my buck elsewhere (came out to $20 after tip/tax). If I were to come back, I would definitely get the gumbo and the crawfish biegnet but I would rather venture to one of the many other brunch options in SF.

I had breakfast at Brenda's French Soul Food with Ruben P. for my birthday (Dec. 31).  It's been a year since I last went here and I'm amazed how far this place has gone when I saw how they were expanding the restaurant.  That's just awesome! No visit at Brenda's would be complete without ordering their Crawfish Beignets (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  How can you not order them?  It was Ruben P.'s first time having them so he was amazed when they came to our table and got blown away by their spicy kick. We both ordered the Grillades and Grits ($10.50) - (http://www.yelp.com/user…) Beef cutlets braised in spicy Creole gravy served over grits, with two eggs any style and choice of biscuit or toast only.  We both opted for wheat toast while Ruben P. ordered Eggs Over Easy and I had Poached Eggs (the chef rocks for pulling that off!).  The food was delicious as expected, but since we had the Crawfish Beignets beforehand, we sadly couldn't commit to finishing our dishes.  Too much good stuff!! Hopefully the next time I make my trip out to Brenda's the expansion should be finished which is very exciting!  Big thanks to Ruben P. for joining me and treating me out for breakfast at Brenda's!

Damn, I waited almost 2 hours for a seat here last Saturday. Thank goodness I needed to catch up with my friends, so we didn't mind that much. Double dating goodness with Kathleen W. and Brandon Y. As a table, we got: beignet flight, watermelon iced tea, Chicken, Sausage & Okra Gumbo, Egg & Bacon Tartine, Hangtown Fry, and a shrimp po'boy. I was hungry before we got there, so I was starving by the time we sat down. For the 4 of us, it was a good meal. The beignet flight was definitely a great choice. My bf and I were worried about the crawfish one. It was the best one out of all of them, I thought. DELICIOUS. The chocolate one was too much and the apple was pretty good. I didn't eat the plain, but my bf had it with the peach preserves they had on the table - looked pretty good. The gumbo was pretty good. We couldn't taste the okra though. The tartine was pretty good as well. Not the best food I had, but decent. It came with grits and well, they were pretty good...for grits I guess. Since I'm not in love cooked oysters, I didn't try my friend's Hangtown fry, but the biscuit was great with the preserves. The shrimp po'boy was pretty good. It actually changed my boyfriend's mind about shrimp po'boys...which is a big deal. So, I win. He never liked them before, but 7x7, you didn't fail us. WATERMELON ICED TEA WAS REALLY REALLY GOOD. Next time I go, I'll just get some crawfish beignets, shrimp po'boys and watermelon iced tea to go and eat at City Hall. Great view and don't have to wait as long!

Food was great. Large portions and TASTY! Only complaint is that main course showed up before we were done with appetizer. The food had great flavor nice use of spice and great texture. The bread pudding was the best I have ever had! Beignets were also good as was the deep fried peach pie. Enjoy!

Thank you Brenda for finally bringing a new twist to brunch in SF!! My sister and I came here today for brunch and this tiny place was packed! Luckily, we had front row parking, so we were able to sit in my car and chat while we waited for our table. The menu consisted of standard brunch items, but with a creole twist. My sister couldn't decide between which beignets to ordered, so she ended getting the flight. The flight came with one of each, plain, chocolate, apple, and savory craw fish. I was definitely eyeing the apple with cinnamon honey filling. I had a bite of it and it was delicious. The filling was sweet with bits of apples. The craw fish one was ok, but you could barely taste the filling. I had the creole veggie omelet with a biscuit and grits. The omelet was filled with fresh tomatoes, peppers, spinach, corn and cheddar cheese and topped with spices. It was very tasty. The grits were very creamy, but had great texture. It was a bit too buttery for me, but it was very delicious. The biscuit was heavenly. It was served warm, flaky and so moist. Breakfast is served all day, so I'm definitely coming back during the weekday for lunch!

Twenty-six years ago, the man who would be our lame duck governor uttered those now immortal words: "Come with me if you want to live." It is a play on this which I present to you for Brenda's French Soul Food's new slogan: "Eat with me if you want to die." That's right.  If you eat at Brenda's, you will die.  You sign up for such death when you put your name on the wait list outside the door.  You will wait... and wait... and wait.  You will die of hunger, of boredom, of sunstroke, or from nearby gunfire, but be assured - you will die. But heaven, my friends, is oh so sweet.  You will be treated to a feast of hearty, oil and butter enveloped fare that you have never experienced in your mortal body.  Such creamy, rich goodness is not meant for the material world.   If you're with friends and would like to be thorough, start with the beignet flight and share with the rest of the table, because in heaven, there's plenty to go around.  Each of these pillows of fried dough is more than enough for one, but this is heaven, so why stop there?  The plain, chocolate, and apple versions are each sweet delights, while the savory and spicy crawfish beignet will make you swear you were a sinner.   If sugar's your poison, forgo the ambrosia and cleanse your palate with the watermelon sweet tea.  Don't hold back if you're tempted to take a longer sip - refills are free! If you it's crustacean you crave, and the crawfish kept you wanting more, you may be blessed with a special of shrimp and grits.  The grits are impossibly creamy, pushing you further into bliss with a sheet of melted cheddar cheese.  The perfectly cooked shrimp is balanced out with tangy marinated tomatoes and fresh scallions. If you are more of a meat lover, go for the Andouille and cheddar omelet, or, if you're feeling for the extra nostalgic, grillades and grits.  The Andouille and piquant sauce are a fiery marvel while the swiss-steak-like grillades will have you aching for the homestead. If you are actually considering getting dessert after this, I commend you; you are well beyond human.  You will walk out of Brenda's - if not roll - realizing that you were not among the ether, but earthbound this whole time.  You will, however, be much closer to death than when you first walked in.

Came here for brunch today and I was definitely surprised! I came around 11 and it was packed! On a Tuesday! Good sign. I love how you can write your name on the chalk board/waiting list. We only had a 5-7 minute wait and got a great seat under the sun light. I had some Oj and my friend got a yummy coffee drink (could have been a capaccino or a machiato- I don't know I'm not a coffee drinker). I had the buttermilk pancakes and fruit (SO HUGE!) and a side of bacon. Oh my lanta! SOO filling and so flavorful. My friend got the grillades and grits. The portion was huge. We couldn't finish our meals. Plus we wanted to save room for beignets. Now.. I've never had soul food. Of any kind. Serious. So this whole experience (well.. I kinda bitched out I got pancakes.. but the fried chicken sandwiches I saw along with gumbo looked AMAZING) was new to me. The beignets- although they look horrible for you.. no matter what way you look at it- by god were they yummy. To be honest I'm sure I ate two days worth of calories.. which is why I walked from their to golden gate park afterwards and felt slightly better about my indulgence. Besides the food- the decor is so homey and even though it's a small place the way it's layed out makes sure to maximize the space. Our bill after two huge breakfasts and some drinks and beignets came out to around $40. I'm all about this place. I can't wait to take someone here now!

My friends and I had gone there on MLK day morning. Perfect timing since there was about 7 of us. I had the andouille sausage omellete. So much sausage, it was great. We also shared the bigniets (the sampler one) and I'd have to say the ghiradelli one was my fav. However if you do love those bigniets, you have to try Angeline's in Berkley if you're ever on that side of the bay. My friend had French toast which was sooooo good. I think i may get that next time. It was perfect: fluffy, sweet, and a great proportion. It also didn't need much syrup at all. My other friend had the corn beef hash omellete which he mentioned was the best corn beef hash he's ever had. The waitress was also very very nice :) Brenda's over all was a great experience.

The Plan:  (Yes, you need one if you want to get in on the weekend action at Brenda's) Set time at which you would like to dine at Brenda's French Soul Food Subtract 30 minutes - this will be the time you will need to get there by and write your name down on their list Subtract x number minutes for commute. At set dining time:  possibly get seated inside the small and cozy restaurant.  Word of warning:  if you sit at the 'bar area' in front of the mirrors, it may be very difficult to keep from staring at the mirror, either to look at yourself while you pig out, or make 'eye contact' with your dining partner Dining time +5 minutes:  order from their tasty menu or specials from friendly waiters. Dining time +about 45 minutes: onset of food coma from rich ingredients and robust proportions. Dining time +2 hours:  succumb to food coma and take a nap.

BRENDA'S WAS DIVINE I think it's safe to say that I could literally feel my arteries clogging up as a friend and I feasted on Brenda's beignet flight and the seafood frittata with grits and a biscuit. I mean it's been about a month and a half and I can still taste the warm, buttery, flaky, salty goodness of that PERFECT biscuit.... Granted, the wait was kind of long (about an hour for brunch at noon on a Saturday), but it just made my friend and I more hungry so we were extra enthusiastic about our meal!   The cramped space made our experience at Brenda's all the more authentic.  We ate at the counter where we felt like customers in a old town NOLA diner in the French Quarter.  Fine young specimen was sitting next to us not so bad to look at in the mirror either.. anyhow, Brenda's hosts a good crowd so that's nothing to worry about..   If you go, make sure you get the beignet flight, and don't leave without trying the crawfish beignet- surprisingly delightful for a savory filling inside a dessert-type shell.  Usually these savory/sweet fusiony things mean trouble, but Brenda's seems to pull it off quite well.   I wouldn't go again, especially with the lack of parking and the irrationally long wait, but Brenda's is a place everybody in the Bay Area should experience at least once.

Loooove Brenda's... only wish the wait wasn't ridiculous EVERY WEEKEND! I've been twice and love everything I've tried there. Servers are very nice and helpful- I always see Brenda working there as well. Comforting to know the owner is usually always on hand doing the dirty work with her staff day in and day out. First time I got the Shrimp and Grits special. Holy moly- this was awesome!!! It comes with a bacon tomato type of chutney/sauce that compliments the whole dish perfectly. It is cheesy grit heaven. I definitely reccomend this dish but be prepared for its richness. I dont remember much detail, but their biscuits were very yummy and freshly made. Love the beignets (duh). Crawfish creole savory beignet was awesome. Great flavors yet a light, fluffy outside. Also love the chocolate beignet, didn't need the apple or plain one. I've also had the fried shrimp po'boy with chipotle aioli and their gumbo is incredible. Definitely hit up Brenda's when you are in the mood for some soul fool!

Sweet Lord, thank you!  At last, genuine New Orleans food at something vaguely like New Orleans prices in SF.  I walked by and saw something on the menu I thought I could only crave in this fat-obsessed town:  deep fried oyster po-boys.   So I went in and had lunch and it was superb--the oysters, though small, were perfectly (light brown, crispy, crunchy) cooked, the remoulade was outstanding, the roll was fresh as could be and the sliced tomato was red/red perfection.  I almost fell over when the waitress asked me if I wanted "sweet or regular" iced tea.  That isn't a question that normally gets asked within a1000 miles of the Pacific. Now I'm just looking forward to going back earlier in the day for some beignets (plain, powdered sugar just like Cafe du Monde).  Laissez les bons temps rouler!

French soul food. What is french soul food? I got more of the soul than the french. Maybe all that i ordered was the cajun-y, southern-y, soul-ish type food, but I think the only french thing about the menu was the french toast? maybe i missed something. Now this is me visiting my friend in SF and she had said that this place is a "must-try"! I have come to terms with the fact that all amazing SF breakfast places all have ridiculous wait times (especially Sunday Brunch). You write your names down on this chalkboard wall and wait outside. Mind you, this place is basically the smallest breakfast joint in life, hence the wait. With a wait time of over an hour we decide to grab a quick coffee nearby during the wait. Once our names were called, we were promptly sat and we ordered their well-known Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea. It's like crack in a cup. So simple, so delicious, so refreshing! We began our breakfast journey with the Beignet Flight. This flight consisted of all 4 of their Beignet flavors: classic plain, chocolate (with Ghirardelli chocolate), Granny Smith Apple, and Crawfish. Tip: Start with the sweet and end with the savory. Apparently if you start mixing it around, your taste palette goes awry. Being a savory loving person, the Crawfish Beignet got my vote! I have a thing for the cayenne pepper sprinkled on top with the melty cheese in the middle. YUM. Then we ordered one of the House Favorites: Hangtown Fry. It was a scramble of oysters, hash, and bacon. It came with the softest, buttery biscuit with a side of *insert Paula Deen's voice "butta". I never had oysters for breakfast and that was a shame because it is absolutely DELISH! I left Brenda's FULL, i mean roll-me-out-of-the-narrow-restaurant type full. If you don't feel the same way as I did when i left the restaurant, you are doing something wrong. BUT ALL IN ALL: A must-try!

Paula Deen would eat here everyday I think if she knew about it. Perfect for lazy, afternoon-brunch-dates with your darling best friend or significant other! Just be prepared to wait outside for about an hour or so...but totally worth it. I recommend wearing stretchy clothing because you're going to eat a lot of heavy, soulful goodness and will want to take a nap afterwards. Don't forget to try the watermelon sweet tea too! :]

Whatever the specials are, do yourself a favor and get 'em! We all ordered from the specials of the day -- banana's foster french toast, the oyster and bacon omelette, and the catfish po' boy. All three were very very good! From their regular menu, as an appetizer, we also ordered the beignet flight to sample all of the beignets (original, apple, crawfish, chocolate). Our party didn't really care for the apple beignet much but we were all in accord that the crawfish beignet was very tasty and the best of the four. This restaurant, although a little cramped, kind of has a cozy feel to it with the friendly service and warm Southern home-style cooked food. The only drawback would have to be the wait. Make sure you aren't starving when you get here because it's almost a guarantee you'll be waiting outside for a good half hour before you are seated.  That being said, Brenda's is still a favorite of mine with some d@mn good food and is well worth the wait! __________ The fried shrimp po' boy is one of the tastiest po' boys I've ever eaten!  Perfectly crisp-breading and seasoned fried shrimp, fully dressed, on a toasted yet fluffy French roll.  The biscuits are buttery, moist, fluffy and awesome. You can get your food to-go or call in for pick-up if you don't want to wait around an hour for a table.

Maybe I'm a sissy. Plus I'm not much for platitudes. But in this case, the path of least resistance is desireable.  I know you want to come here on the weekend with your friends, but do yourself a favor and take the easy way; ditch work on a weekday and come eat here. Yeah, French soul food kind of sounds like an odd combination, but somehow Brenda's does it just right. For starters, just do yourself a favor and get the Beignet Flight and try each one.  By far the most interesting is the one with crawfish in the middle but in either case they are all good and I don't even like sweets.  If  these don't even count as "good" beignets then I'd probably lose my shiz it if I tasted better ones. My dining partner and I had the shrimp and goat cheese omlete and the egg and bacon tartine.  Both dishes were great.  I'd get the grits, they are pretty awesome.  The omlete was an excellent mix of tomato cheese and shrimp.  I normall ylike ketchup on my eggs and didn't feel I needed it with this one.  The tartine was almost like a big delicious open-faced breakfast sandwich.  I ended up eating as much of each as I could but sadly we didn't finish our dishes. Oh and I must throw out a special recommendation for the biscuits.  They are big, fluffy and tasty.  Throw on some of the homemade slightly spiced jam but try not to get too full...

3.5 Stars. Oh Brenda, how dearly I wanted to love you! Stephen N. and I were embarking on a long, food-filled, eating adventure and Brenda's was our first stop. I had to have the beignets and, after quite a few indecisive minutes, we decided to get the Eggs Tartine as well. First the beignets. We got the sampler and couldn't wait to dig in. I expected them to be warm, pillowy, melt-in-your-mouth morsels but they were quite heavy, doughy, and filling. I found that they lacked flavor and were a bit like cardboard in texture. They weren't horrible, but I wouldn't try for it again. The unexpected crowd favorite was the Eggs Tartine. An open-faced sandwich with scrambled eggs and tomato salsa? It sounded so boring and safe. And I HATE scrambled eggs! Oh how wrong I was! The combination of simple ingredients made for fantastic flavor and textures that made this disappear ~2.5X faster than the beignets. Definitely recommended!

My grandpa lives right next door to this place so we thought we might as well just go once to see what all the fuss was about. He also rarely strays away from Chinese food so my mother and I thought it would be a nice change. Unfortunately this place failed to impress any of us. We went at 1 on St. Pattys Day. There was no wait for the counter but we wanted at able so the lady who happened to look a lot like my ceramics teacher (not a good thing), quoted us a 20-25 minutes waiting time. It ended up being 45 minutes. Beignet Flight: I never had them before and I had no idea these things were so hard. I always imagined them to be nice and fluffy. The apple one was pretty good and so was the crawfish except I nearly choked on the powder on top of the crawfish one. I didn't bother trying the plain one and the chocolate on was intense. These were not impressive. No idea why they are so popular. Shrimp Po Boy: The best thing we ordered. This really is delicious. A little too much bread but I just ate it open faced style. Ordered with a side of the best coleslaw I've ever tasted. I hate coleslaw and I only ordered it because I know my mother likes it. It is really light and fresh as opposed to other places and their gross mayo mush. Vegan Josephine: "Best tofu you'll ever wrap your mouth around" LIES LIES LIES! I couldn't even tell it was tofu (not a good thing in this context). It was a horrible salty mess. The bottom bun was also disgustingly soggy. I took two bites and took it home. Ate it later that night and it tastes better cold. I disposed of the bottom bun and retoasted the top bun. I ordered it with a side of fries that came out perfect. Thin and crunchy. Love the watermelon pickles! Crawfish Pot Pie: This was just stupid. Ordered for my grandpa. He hated it. Gave it to my mother. She had no idea what she was eating. I tried a bit of the cheese biscuit and it was terrible. Wtf? Avoid at all costs. The side salad was also warm and mediocre. Watermelon Iced Tea: My grandpa saw the giant container of it and wanted to try it. He said it tasted like nothing and then he poured water into it. He is so silly. Luckily it comes with free refills! I don't usually drink fruit flavored tea but the tea was really good and incredibly refreshing on that hot day. I really did not like our waitress/woman at the door. We had to wave her down to order, get boxes, etc. She also didn't have that great of an attitude. There was another blonde woman working there who was incredibly nice! I wish she was our waitress. Props to her. Try: Shrimp Po Boy, Coleslaw, Fries, Watermelon Iced Tea, and Watermelon Pickles. Avoid: Vegan Josephine, Crawfish Pot Pie, Beignets, and the bitchy brunette.

I know it's a beloved SF institution and I'm glad that I was finally able to try brunch at one of the legendary places. First of all -- the location is not great. Expect your walk there (whether from parking or BART) to be somewhat uncomfortable. Brenda's is literally across from public housing and I can only imagine what the people who live there think (who are all these ridiculous people who have nothing better to do than spend over an hour waiting for brunch?) I got there at maybe just before 11am on a Saturday, so fairly peak time for brunching. I'd say I ended up waiting maybe a half hour, so it felt like awhile, but nothing quite as long as I had been led to believe. Ultimately, the food wasn't quite as good as I had been led to believe either. The menu is filled with delicious, rich-sounding items and in addition, there are equally scrumptious sounding specials too. My friend and I elected to split the crawfish beignets and then we each got the fried catfish benedict as well. This was way too much food for the two of us; the beignets and one order of the benedict would have been wiser. By the time I left I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach -- but that's my own fault (but you can't take eggs benedict home! they wouldn't taste nearly as good!) I've only had sweet beignets before at Angeline's in Berkeley and I adored them. I love savory even more so savory beignets sounded quite promising to me. But the dough was so heavy and deep fried that I ended up feeling like I was eating fried bread filled with crawfish. It was nothing like the light fluffy beignets I've had previously. Tasty, but very heavy. The catfish benedict was quite good. Instead of an English muffin, they have a rich, buttery biscuit on the bottom. I think that was my favorite thing I ate at Brenda's. The egg and catfish were good too, though the hollandaise was a little mustard-y for my taste. Not being much of a grits fan and definitely a huge potato fan, I opted for the hash as my side. Mistake. There was a large quantity of potatoes but they were mushy, textureless, and spiced yet still bland. When something is called a hash, I expect there to be crispy bits.

3.5 FOOD/DRINK: 1.) Beignet Flight = I would come back to get this for a dessert only :) But that's if ... a.) Crawfish Beignet = omg... the quick tips are true!!!!! lol This is hella good! It's tasty and it reminds me kind of a bao.. haha. I'm so asian. 2.) Shrimp & Grits = mm! I was totally craving shrimp & grits! This was reeeally cheezy! To the point of being stringggyyy.... and the tomatoes were kind of too tasty... 3.) Hangtown Fry = hm... this is .. interesting.. not used or wasn't really craving the flavor of this? Kind of a smokey bacon flavor in an omelette/scramble? haha and then "hash" or cubed potatoes like country potatoes almost 4.) Watermelon Ice Tea = tastes like real watermelon inside.. haha.. I guess it's refreshing except melons make the back of my throat a tad itchy SERVICE: Alright. Could be better. No body really greeted us or gave a friendly welcome. We wrote our own name on the waiting board. Our waitress gave me the one-minute finger, when I needed a spoon to eat my grits. And so i proceeded to wait for her to finish cleaning a table with her sweet time... when there were other clean empty tables and no one waiting at the door for a new table. They did however box the leftovers for us. Totally going to stay at Farmer Browns. Farmer Browns has those complimentary corn bread minis and a much nicer atmosphere. ATMOSPHERE: It's simple, it's open, high ceiling, mostly white walls, but one side looks like the outside wall of a fading Southern art ad ... Then the graphic design of Brenda's is cute, it's a chalkboard writing of the name which coincides with the big chalkboard at the entrance to put our name on the waiting list :)

Finally got a chance to sit down to have lunch at Brendas this week WITHOUT having to wait- how cool is that??? I ordered the sloppy josephine, which to my tasting, wasnt that great. I think I ate more fries than I did the sandwich (the skinny fries were really good!). My friend ordered the shrimp sandwich which she enjoyed. We also ordered the beignet platter and I enjoyed each flavor, especially the chocolate one, yummmmy! Anyhow, I think i'd rather be back for their breakfask menu rather than lunch.

Ok no death phrases (lol Mel you crack me up) but I will say; I really do enjoy coming here! I've been a handful of times and have to say 4 stars is quite accurate. I would have given 5 but the last time I came in they made me and my gf switch seats 3 times! Then were out of tea (sad face...) and while I love every thing they have on their menu, I wish they would stay open later...and make more tea! It was 2:30pm and I was there with people spilling in till 5min to 3pm. So I am sure they would not lose $ on an extra pot of tea or two... My only other complaint was about the temp. in that place; they seriously need to put on a heater in there cause it's freezing and that door constantly opening and closing does not help. I hate eating my meals with every sticth of clothing on! I say give em a try - maybe take-out would be better. Or warmer...but it is still a great little slice of heaven in a very low-key location. Only reason to want to run downtown at 8am on a weekday and pay $3 an hour for parking when  I am not working! LOL

For a long time, I wondered if I was going to find beignets outside of New Orleans and in San Francisco.  My long and arduous search for those beignets has come to end. Brenda's is a small restaurant which serves up some great brunch soul food.  We place a starter order of beignets with granny smith apples and cinnamon honey butter. In the beignets, the apples are cut in small cubes surrounded by melted cinnamon honey butter.  The appearance is like an apple pie when you cut into it.   I always appreciate those that cook with granny smith apples since they have the best tart apple flavor in any dish. For the main brunch plates, we ordered the adouille & cheddar omelette and the creole veggie omelette.  Both omelettes are great.  With the omelettes you are given a choice of potato hash or grits and cream biscuit or toast.  The potato hash is ok - nothing special.  The grits are served in a smaller dish with butter on top; very good if you are a grits fan.  The cream biscuit is flaky on the outside - heavenly in flavor. The location is in the Tenderloin.  May not be ideal for entertaining out of town guests -- but if service and food quality are high in priority, Brendas will come through for you. This is my first time at Brenda's French Soul Food.  Ever get the feeling when you go somewhere that this is going to be a favorite place for a long time?  Try it out - it's worth it!

I love the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. Calls me crazy, but something about the crack-addled vibe there always gets my juices going. Ain't nowhere else in SF but the Tenderloin are you able to see someone sell their body, buy chunk o' crack in broad daylight, and urinate on the street (usually all at the same time)... it's surreal. And smack dab in the midst of this quagmire sits Brenda's French Soul Food.  An unassuming and unexpected eatery which makes most of its living on breakfast alone.  Lunch is available, but most peeps come here for the amazing breakfasts.  Forget about dinner though, walking around this neck of the woods without the security of daylight is only asking for trouble.  You might as well attend a vampire convention with a sign around your neck that says "O-Positive, come n' get it!". The highlight of Brenda's is the southern staple of beignets.  Sweet or savory, they're all good.  Fluffy, light, and rich... like potato chips, you can't eat just one. I had a banana pudding french toast special with a bourbon carmel pecan sauce that lit my britches on fire.  It was nice cause my britches have been needing some toasting lately, but I digress. Wifey ordered Brenda's famous super-fluffy pancakes and we were mightily impressed.  Each flapjack was almost an inch thick, but light as a cloud. Don't forget to order the grits!  Any self-respecting Southerner would never have breakfast without grits!  Brenda's grits are creamy and smooth with lots of butter and love. A fantastic breakfast place.  Unfortunately, it's tiny so the line to get in can be extremely lengthy, especially on weekends.  As there's barely enough space inside to even seat the diners, you're gonna have to spend your wait outside with the denizens of the Tenderloin.  So feel free to buy some drugs and defecate on the street as you're waiting, blend with the locals.

Brenda's has some unique menu options that you will rarely see anywhere else. I recently came for Father's Day and the wait was absolutely ridiculous. And that had NOTHING to do with the fact that it was Father's Day.1 Hour and 45-minutes after putting our name down we finally were seated and ready to eat the entire menu. We started off with the Beignet Flight - a sampling of 4 different beignets (Chocolate, Apple, Craw fish and Plain). I expected the beignets to be similar to Cafe Du Monde in NOLA - which are soft and delectable. Sadly these were thick and a bit too hard for my liking. For my entree I ordered the Adoulle Sausage omelet with mushrooms and scallions - delicious!! It was served with home fried potatoes and a Biscuit. The biscuit was by far THE BEST BISCUIT I've ever had the pleasure to eat. OMG - I have no idea how it's even possible for a biscuit to be that moist and fluffy. I washed the meal down with a watermelon sweet tea (which wasn't overly sweetened). Overall - Brenda's food is Fan-Freakin-Tastic! However, in my opinion no meal is ever worth waiting 2-hrs for!

I actually want to give 3.7 stars. A bit less than 4 and I will tell you why. Their grits is like out of heaven good! I don't know exactly what is the flavor but it is way way better than my home made cooking white grits. Their is yellow to begin with, so something in it, right? Of course lots of butter... maybe even creme... well, it's OK. early enough time so I can eat a bit of creme. Anyway, it is soooo good! And also their biscuits are so light and crispy and perfect! (it means BUTTER!) We got so full, so we couldn't eat beignets, but we sure want to come back to try. The one of  reasons is the place is too small!!! Well, they did the best they can but it's not quite comfortable because it just people and servers are walking around too close. But, hey, it's still all OK. That is 0.3 star minus... just a little bit. The other reason is of course the taste. I ate the Creole Veggie Omelette $8.50, I kind was a bit disappointed the flavor was quite regular. It tasted like I MADE IT at home, kind of thing. My friend ate Adouille and Cheddar Omelette $8.75 and it was a bit better because of the sauce but still not enough flavor, I thought. Well, I will go back and try other menus. Maybe 3.7 is too harsh. 3.9 is good.

Hmm...Its Saturday in SF, we have friends in town, and we need a place for Brunch. My wife decides to pick a place that has an item from the 7x7 Big Eat list. # 42.Fried-shrimp po'boy - Why is this on the list? Baby fried shimp with some sauce and a few fixings, but I think I could have gotten a better one at Long John Silver.  The fries served with the dish were sort of soggy, very unappealing. (This wasn't even my meal, I had a few bites, but I am glad I didn't order it) The Croque Monsieur was pretty tasty from what I heard. It looked pretty good from where I was sitting. The 4th at our table ordered a simple plate of the catfish. They brought out 2 strips..REALLY!!!! This is a grown man asking for a plate of catfish... I will get to the catfish in a moment. Dave was modest in his response to our reactions..."he had eaten earlier so he was not that hunrgy, and Oh, the sauce was tasty" On to my dish... I ordered the Eggs Benedict with fried catfish. Ok, there was a side of hash that was pretty tasty. chunky and even sort of cheesy. Unfortunately the Eggs Benedict and Catfish were sort of a let down. Instead of getting an eggs benedict, (A dish consisting of toasted halves of English muffin topped with Fried Catfish, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce). I was served a starchy biscuit  that was pretty dry, topped with a hard boiled egg.  On top of that was what tasted like a frozen fish stick that was dropped in the deep frier, drenched with a sticky sauce... In conclusion, We waited over an hour to be seated, (we expected the long wait), The food was just sad... and we were pretty embarrassed to have invited our family friends to this place...

Normally I'm willing to forgive not-so-stellar service, but it was freakin awful here. The wait for a table was long-sure, I get that. But after 45 minutes (on a Wednesday mid-morning) when we were called, seated, and THEN asked to leave and go back outside, I was pretty pissed. It's up to the hostess to make sure s/he seats the right table. I've never seen a restaurant kick people back outside after they were seated AND given menus. Whatever, I was willing to let that go. Once reseated, service was slow (again, willing to forgive because they're busy), AND the waitress messed up our order. We got the supposedly awesome beignets and anxiously awaited their arrival. For 15 minutes. Assuming they were busy and slow. However, once the fried shrimp po boy and grillades and grits came, I knew it was time to say byebye to the delicious dreams of soft beignets. I also got the wrong side (toast instead of biscuit) with my dish. The po boy was pretty delicious. The grillades were okay, but nothing out of this world. And my stomach wanted to kill me 30 minutes later.

Small but cozy atmosphere. Lunch entrees are about $10 a pop.  I had the corned beef hash. It was okay but the biscuit - OMG!!!! That with the homemade peach jam was to die for. My friend always gets the tartine - next time I'll go for that and oh course, the biscuit. I have dreams about that biscuit it's so good. Wait is well worth it. We waited for about 15-20 minutes on a Tuesday. Got there a little before noon and it was already packed. Go there a little earlier or later to get a seat without the long wait. And don't forget the watermelon iced tea. Delicioso.

What a great find in the TL of all places. A co-worker and I arrived around 11:15 on a Friday and to our surprise the tiny restaurant was filled to capacity. But it must've been our lucky day since we got the last table for two. However, if all seats are taken, you must remember to put your name down on the sign in sheet hung up near the doorway. As we manuevered to our seats, I began noticing the deafening noise level and very crowded seating. They really try to pack as many bodies and tables into a small area. It's hard not to bump into somebody or another chair. Once we got to our seats, our menus were brought to us rather quickly as well as our glass of water. We each settled for a fried oyster poboy and shared the crawfish beignet as an appetizer. I also decided on the watermelon iced tea, which seemed to be a favorite among other yelpsters. Crawfish beignet: You get 3 pretty good size pieces for $6. They are oval shaped New Orleans style donuts. Crunchy and seasoned w/cayan for a nice kicker on the outside and moist on the inside. It was filled with melted cheddar cheese, scallions, and pieces of, yes, crawfish. It was definately well worth it! The dessert beignets looked yummy as well. A must get for next time. Fried oyster Poboy (sandwich): Probably one of the best tasting poboys i've had. You get a generous amount of fried oysters tucked under the toasty bread w/a spread of their chipotle remoulade (very good!!). It also comes w/a tomato and lettuce served w/a side of regular fries. ($9.25) Sweet watermelon tea: Refreshing made w/real watermelon rinds and juice. You get a free refill! ($2.25) Overall, this will definately be a restaurant in my regular lunch rotation. Delicious food which also made for great leftovers b/c you get large portions. Their breakfast entrees (served throughout the day 'til 3 PM) also looked and smelled wonderful so i'll have to come back for that b/c we were stuffed this time around. Service was excellent even though they were very busy. Minus one star for having to shout across the table for my co-worker to hear anything I was saying. It was a bit too loud on the ears for a comfortable and relaxing lunch. The lady sitting next to my coworker fell on her lap after losing her balance - how's that for tight seating? FYI, they close at 3 PM.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I really enjoy Brenda's.  It's small, cozy, and sweet... a combination you don't generally find in the Tenderloin.  Though this small space does mean a huge wait, it's worth it if you've never been. I looooove the french toast.  It's absolutely fantastic brioche topped with this caramely butter pecan sauce over the top.  AH so good!  This was also the first place I tried grits, which was such an awesome experience.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the watermelon iced tea, but maybe it's just not my thing ?  Everyone else seemed to love it. Warning that the portions are huge and that this is not exactly a figure-friendly spot.  But if you don't mind waiting outside or sitting really close to your table neighbors, you should definitely check out Brenda's!

Thank you Yelpers for this gem!  Went with a long time friend for brunch.  Didnt mind the long wait outside in the light rain, and yeah, it was worth the wait.  OMG we split everything and pigged out! Splitting the beignet flight sampler was almost a meal itself.  They were light and non-greasy, tasted heavenly, and each with their own style.  I loved the plain one, as well as the crawfish (would also be great if served later with an IPA!!).  The chocolate filled was also fantastic. The apple was a bit overspiced (nutmeg?) for my enjoyment. Now that we were full, the other 2 dished we ordered arrived.  The andule cheedar omelet was one of the lightest fluffy omelets I ever had. It had this unbelieveable piquant on top that was so good even on its own.  Dish also came with a heaping bowl of to-die-for grits (thank you butter!) and a biscuit which had to be the lighest but crispiest - best biscuit I ever had. (thank you Crisco?!) We also shared a Croque Monsieur, which was top notch.  Its ham and Gruyère with bechamel sauce on sliced sourdough.  oh my---the best ever grilled cheese substitute! Like if that wasnt enough, my friend had to try the special of the day Sweet Potato Pancake, and the great wait-staff let him just order one.  It was fantastic, but I only had a taste.  Dang, I dont know where he put it all. I love the small cosy room and feel of the place.  It was just perfect for a fun day in the city, and kept us full for the whole day!

Just ate at Brendas last Sat, great eating atmosphere and setting similar to Angelines in Berkeley. As all reviews recommend, the watermelon iced tea is a refreshing watermelon sweet tea, and my dad got the crawfish beignets which he liked alot I got the french toast with butter pecan sauce, french toast is great but the sauce was amazing kinda resembles a pecan tart from the oven, not too sweet and not too buttery. Ima big french toast fan and i highly recommend this place over rick and anns in the claremont neighborhood. Breakfast is delish and there was definitely an advantage to being 2nd in line before opening at 8a. Great start to morning in SF

YUM! Came here for brunch and wasn't expecting everything I got. The front door is hidden by a bunch of construction and the area is not exactly wonderful, but its so worth it to make the trip! Things that were memorable: -The Crawfish beignet: so so warm and flaky and tasty. Has a little kick, but soooo worth it. -The cajun bloody mary: Tasty with the right amount of spice. Sometimes I don't like things to be too tomato-ey, but this was just right. Plus I loved the okra garnish! -The eggs benedict was amazing! The creole hollandaise is way better that the regular sauce and the use of biscuits instead of a traditional english muffin was a great touch! I was so so so happy and full after eating! Expect a sizable wait because the place is small... well worth it.

Ok, so I FINALLY made it to Brendas for brunch. Of course the wait was around an hour for 2 people.... Of course I went around the corner and bought a Blue Moon tall bottle and brown bagged it out front to pass the time in usual Tenderlord fashion. Once we were seated .. the service was prompt and pleasant. I quickly ordered the crawfish beignets.... they were really delicious but I will have to say ... I would rather be served 2 FULLY stuffed beignets than 3 barely filled ones. The inside was oh so good but not a lot in there. I also ordered the pork chop special and the gumbo .... sharing all items. The Gumbo was good but could have been a little spicier and was a little on the salty side. I have been to Nawlins and stuff def runs spicier there. The pork chop was good ... very tender and had a good molasses flavor. The hashed sweet potatos were also really good but filling. The highlight of the meal to me was the biscuits! They were so light and flakey and buttery. There was a jar of peach compote/jam on the counter which was delightfully delicious. I then noticed that they serve the benedict on the biscuits! That is my favorite way to have my eggs benny! I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for something different and will be having the benedict next time for sure..... lets hope the holly sauce is the money!

I lugged myself halfway across the city to wait over an hour in line for brunch because my homie from LA wanted beignets. In that hour we: - joked about crossing names off the ill-guarded wait list. Of course we didn't (and would never) do this. That would be MESSED UP. - witnessed a lady get skipped without a beat because her partner went to the bathroom next door at Taco Bell. That sucked. I asked homeskillet if she had been the next party, would she play the saint and offer up the table? She said HELL NO. - walked down to City Hall so I could show her the Victory Garden... which has only been gone since last year! This shows how aware I am of my city. - went to Citizen Cake so she could buy a cupcake that didn't correctly fit into it's to-go box. Homefry insisted to the counter person that she wanted the second cupcake in, because, as she later explained to me, that one had the better icing-to-cake ratio. Um. Well, so much for that, because the cupcake was a vanilla fluff too big for the take-out box, and the sides got crushed up. Imagine if a big old round muffin was shoved into a bitty square container, and the best part of the muffin just turned into a crumb of regret! That was sad. - read the A-frame menu of specials outside the restaurant, where homegriddle accused me of liking eggs benedicts more than I actually do. I only like them OK, ok? When we finally went inside, I got the oyster and bacon scramble! They sat us at the side counter in front of the mirrors. Before the food arrives, it's cool because you can people-watch the entire restaurant. After, it's gets weird because chances are you've never seen yourself eat. Everything we ordered was pretty damn good, though I cared more about my biscuit than my beignet. The bill comes folded with clothespins. Homegirl attached them to my sweater at the shoulders for laughs, and I looked like I was part of the stupid Viktor & Rolf Fall 2007 runway show. (I had to look that up.) Is the wait worth it? Only if you don't have an additional hour of travel time to and fro where you need to be. But if the company is good, it will be fine even then.

The wait for Brenda's on this brisk, wintry Monday afternoon was bearable, being that I was happily nursing my Philz' tantalizing turkish. A mere 30 minutes later, we were politely ushered into the newly renovated interior, bustling with lively incessant chatter and the occasional clanking of silverware. We ordered the sandwich board specials, Hangtown Fry and Shrimp & Grits. The Hangtown Fry was an oyster and bacon scramble, accompanied by hash and a biscuit. The trio of oyster, bacon and egg melded nicely together albeit arid, it was still salvageable after a liberal slathering of Crystal hot sauce. The potatoes were overly desiccant and the biscuit was curiously undercooked. The infamous Shrimp and Grits were heavily inundated with flavor. Too much flavor. It was overwhelmingly salty and enveloped in cheese. Great brunch spot for friends who want to experience the "hype" but having had my "Brenda" cherry popped once before, it was more than enough. Next!

After a trip to New Orleans, this place just doesn't compare. The food is great, but not worth the price and the wait. I love the kitschy chalkboard in front that is used as a waiting list. Unfortunately, I sat next to it, getting covered in dust for well over an hour as I watched the names above me slowly get crossed off. Still, I was glad to be inside sitting and not standing outside like the dozens of folks who got there after I did. I grew up eating grits for breakfast, and I promise you that the butter drenched bowl that came from the kitchen did not look anything like what my grandmother ever made me. The first bite was great, but I didn't dare eat more than a few spoonfuls for fear of the itis, a heart attack, or both! 2.50 for a bowl of grits? Get the heck out of here! You can buy a whole box for that price! I guess you can charge that much when gentrified bourgie hipsters love your place. The biscuit was flaky and soft, and I was happy with my andouille omelette, but the  I'm taking two stars because this place just can't get away with calling what it serves soul food.

A tiny place with a big heart. BEST creole/soul food southern style breakfast foods I've found in they city. There's almost always a wait, so either get there before the crowds or bring a snack! Their specials are the best and they certainly keep to the code of the "specials menu". Meaning....it really is a delightful treat above the rest of their standard menu offerings - unlike other restaurants that have a "specials menu" only to be tricked and be served something mediocre. My friend had their special peach cobbler pancake (that sucker was HUGE and oh so GOOD). I had their Grillades and Grits and it was a breakfast of champions. Nicely sliced pieces of meat with great flavors to compliment. We shared their Beignets, which were very much like the real deal I had in Louisiana. Service was friendly and prompt, atmosphere is cozy, and to top it off, their coffee is great too. A diamond in the rough...literally. The surrounding area is totally shady, but...it adds to the character of the place.

Five-star breakdown: 1. Sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce.  Our breakfast conversation stalled a few times because our eyes rolled back in euphoria from the sauce.  It's a specialty, so order it whenever it's offered. 2. The pancakes took five more minutes to prepare, but enough time for them to give us complimentary beignets for the wait.  It couldn't fit onto our table or into our stomachs.  Haha. 3. Watermelon iced tea: sweetened iced tea that tastes like watermelon juice.  If I could get one glass for the road, I'd do it. 4. Grilades and grits.  Like the pancakes, it was another conversation staller.  Combined with the pancakes and watermelon iced tea, you have a recipe for full-on food coma. 5. Awesome service with only one server.  She took care of us as well as everyone else.  And everyone else were returning customers who brought others along to try the place for the first time.

Fridays off has its perks (gotta stay positive despite furloughs).  One of its perks is well you get to try places that usually have long lines in the weekends.  Like what spot?  Like Brenda's! My friend had a day off and so we went to try this place.  Parking was no problem, just have to make sure you have lots of coins.  We got to the place and it was already crackin'.  There were a couple of parties ahead of us but we got seated right away.  Oh yea as we were leaving around 11am I think, there was already quite a wait.  So do come early.   This place was pretty small.  You will be seated pretty close to the next patron but no problem, just don't listen to their conversations.   Now on to the food.  We ordered: The flight - beignets with different insides.  They were all good.  Oh yea they use Ghirardelli chocolate, you just know that it is.   shrimp and grits - I got this one and couldn't finish it.  it was buttery yummy and shrimp was perfectly cooked.   biscuits -  creaammmy and yummmmy coffeeee - yea even their coffee was good, hahah.   my friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and she liked it too.   I ordered fish sandwich for the hubby to and it came with fries.  I think he liked it, but eh he's kinda picky.   So I heard they serve dinner.  I wanna try, but I don't know if I can wait.  I wanna come back here again on an early Friday morning.  No wait.  Now I just need to convince my hubby or  friends to take a Friday off.

It's a good place, not mind-blowing. A group of four of us got there at 9am and had 10 parties ahead of us already. Thankfully our wait was maybe only 35 minutes (probably wouldn't wait any longer than this...) and we passed the time by getting coffee around the corner at Philz. Once in we ordered the beignet flight of course and actually my favorite was the crawfish and scallion and second up the original. We all almost got full off of these alone! So much food on a little tasting plate! You get four huge beignets.. so prepare yourself for that! We also tried the tartine, the eggs benedict with ham and the benedict with fried chicken. My friend and I split the latter which was a great idea because you seriously get a shit ton of food. I would say the prices made me bump this review up to 4 stars because everything was maybe $10 and under. The quality and portions were both great so it's definitely a fair deal. Check it out if you want a unique brunch and don't mind a long wait.

Waited outside for 30-45 minutes today; went to Brenda's alone since I wanted to eat something before heading off to the library for some cram research. I had to sit at the counter, which wasn't too bad. I noticed all three servers had helped me out at one point or another; all of them looked a little tired and worn, but nonetheless still amicable. I didn't want to order anything that was going to make me have a food coma, so I went light on the order-- One order of plain beignets and a side of andouille, complete with a (refillable!) glass of sweet watermelon tea. It was my first time to try beignets and I felt they were the right consistency for me--lighter and fluffier than an American donut, and the powdered sugar on top was just right for the sweetness. The sweet watermelon tea was also tasty, full of lycopene and the like. While drinking the tea, I felt like I was somewhere down South instead of in San Francisco.... The andouille, however, was okay, but I'm not quite sure if it was supposed to have that strange taste to it--I felt like a few bites of the andouille seemed to have a hint of dishwater lingering in them. Rather grossed me out. The tightness of the small space was not comfortable, but it also played into the ambience of a southern diner, which I'm sure was what Brenda was going after. Not a good place for large groups, but good enough for going solo, on a lunch date, or with two friends. I'm rating the place as "A-OK" for the timebeing, since I feel I should try one of the more "meal-like" dishes first before fully jumping in with the consensus on here. It was my first time trying Cajun food actually, so that's a great plus that Brenda's French Soul Food didn't turn me off to the cuisine. =)

OMG, this little spot is such a gem!   The grits alone are simply SLAMMIN.  I had the Creole Veggie Omelette with extra cheese and a biscuit; straight up scrumptious goodness!  Just to top it off, the watermelon tea was a total treat. This place is definitely worth the trip to the Civic Center area.  YUM YUM YUM.

I'm almost tempted to wait until I can write the 1000th review because the 1000th review obviously matters more than the 997th and the 996 reviews that precede that... =P  I'll try to keep this one short because everyone already knows this place is rad. YES YES YES: - Fried catfish benedict = orgamiscally caloric and so so good. I was seriously full all day. Perfect crust on a flaky fish. Though the egg could have been a little undercooked. I like the yolk everywhere :) - Cream biscuits and jam - Chicken, sausage, okra gumbo. MMMMMMMMMM. MEH: - Potato hash. Looked flavorful but lacked it. I would get the grits if you can. I saw someone put jam in their grits... mmm. - Chocolate beignets. I expected light and fluffy. I got dense and heavy. NO NO NO: - Long ass wait. We waited about 2.5 hours. If you have time to kill, you can enjoy some of their coffee while waiting outside. Ended up getting back to socal at midnight =(

Faced with a massive line of upbeat diners in the Tenderloin, we decided to order our po-boy to go. This sandwich was probably not the best thing on the Brenda's menu. Bread was average, toasted and dripping with butter. Tomato and chopped lettuce were mediocre, slightly out of season. Fried shrimp were tasty and went well with creole aoli. I ended up picking hose out to eat separately. Not sure why this sandwich made the 7x7 list, especially considering the mouthwatering beignets.

Brenda's is exactly the kind of food I love: jazzed-up soul food.  I came in not knowing whether I wanted sweets or salties.  I have been on sort of a sweets kick, so I actually thought about trying out some Southern delights.  The vibe here is kind of cool, as it is very low-key;  the seating is VERY cozy and intimate. It has been a long time since I have been overwhelmed by a menu, meaning having too many choices that look good.  That was the case here. Though I am no donut fan, I had to try the beignets if I was at a New Orleans joint.  The flight came with 4 huge ones, a great amount of food for $8.  The crawfish one was no doubt my favorite; it was creamy and rich inside.  The chocolate one was rich and sweet, the apple one was tart, and the original was light.  The texture was a bit denser than I would have liked, but they were nonetheless hearty and tender. The crawfish potpie was a bit more disappointing.  It was filling, but it lacked that "oomph" you get from a lot from real down-home cooking.  It had good flavors overall, but the small details that need to be flawless were a bit...flawed.  The crust was essentially some soggy breadcrumbs with a far-too-thick layer of cheddar.  The broth/stock was a bit lacking (sorry, but I do not like my potpie to be all meat).  The accompanying mixed greens salad had a nice mustard punch, though. Brenda's has some great unique offerings done in familiar fashion, but I do think the food needs a bit of tweaking.  Though my meal was not perfect, Brenda's has my vote for a change of pace for affordable heart-warming food, though.

Service: 2 Stars (this is being generous!) We waited 1.5 hours after placing our name on their "Blackboard" and saw at least 5 Groups of people that clearly arrived after us, seated before us.  When I approached someone about this, they uncaringly said that many people sign up and get coffee elsewhere so they probably signed in before we did.  We were standing in front of the restaurant the whole time, and clearly saw that the parties in question signed in after us.  One look at the Blackboard would explain why there was so much confusion.  There were erasures, "X's",  lines, and blank spaces all over the Blackboard.  This system is fraught with opportunity for the unscrupulous to take advantage.  The manager couldn't care less.   Food: 4 Stars Great comfort food, but at times inconsistent in preparation.  I had the "Hometown Fry" today and it was undercooked and runny.  The Beignets were over fried so they were very hard on the outside, and the gumbo tasted like someone forgot to add the seasonings in during cooking, so they added them in later. Attitude: 1.5 Stars Since this can be a fast paced restaurant catering to many, don't expect to be treated well here.  There seems to be a level of apathy amongst the staff that permeates the entire establishment.  You never really have one person waiting on you, instead you have several people who at times are very attentive and at other times you have to track down if you need anything.   I've had great food here before, but today, the experience was a total disaster!  If not for my memory of the food on previous visits, there would be no reason to return!  I think that some of these reviews are ridiculously over-generous!  To give this place 5 Stars, I would have to assume that it's Brenda herself writing these reviews!

My friend and I got Ham Eggs Benedict and a Veggie Omelette. I got potato hash as a side dish, and he got the grits. Both got the biscuits, which were exquisite. Moist, flavorful, buttery, yumm!!! My eggs were absolutely delicious, but lukewarm, unfortunately. My friend's grits were lukewarm, too, but super-tasty. Call me picky, but as fantastic as the food was, it not being hot spoiled the whole experience. The place was too busy, and we were too hungry for a redo. Staff was friendly, but super-busy with no time for real service. To be honest, I felt weird tipping bc there was nothing else provided other than the delivery of the plates and the check IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEAL!  If the food weren't so good, I would have given three stars for the lousy service. However, I WILL be back with hopes for a friendlier and hotter experience!

Came in after wanting to eat here for a long time.  My friend ordered a cup of gumbo and so the journey began. I nonchalantly took a spoonful and it was amazing. I have never had soul food do hearty before. The portions may seem small but are incredibly filling. I ordered the BFC and a side of Mac and Cheese. It was mindblowing. The Mac and Cheese had melted cheese crust on top with soft, savory macaroni underneath. The chicken skin was a bit spicy which was perfect for me. The chicken meat was moist. The biscuit seemed a tad dry, but the flavor was there. Everything together was just more than I expected. I will most definitely return and I highly recommend this place to everyone.

So, two years later, I decided to give this place another try.  Waited about 30-40 minutes for a table, not bad, considering it was prime brunch time on a Sunday.  I was very impressed by the service that begin immediately once we were seated.  Drinks were brought out right away, then our food, and each plate was looked after by our very attentive server.  As soon as one was cleared, she brought out our next dish.  Coffee cups were never left empty. We had the apple beignets, which were delicious, but over nutmegged. Cornbread was a huge portion, so soft and crumbly. Oh my, and the Bennedicts--how I wish these were daily items and not specials.  This has got to be some of the best hollandaise I've had.  That says a lot because I frequently make my own.  I love the mustard grains in the sauce.  So much flavor and it doesn't taste overwhelmingly of butter.  Also, those homemade biscuits. The mistake was ordering the rest of the stuff.  By the time the Bennedicts came, I was already full and couldn't enjoy them to their fullest.  And I'm sorry to say this, but the bennedicts here are even better than Mama's at Washington Square. So why not 5 stars?  No matter how much I love the bennedict, it was still just a special item.  The daily offerings still aren't five star quality.  Grtis were creamy and delicious, but overloaded with butter.  The apples were overspiced and I could barely taste the apple.  The cornbread is good, but it's nothing phenomenal.  Coffee with chicory is tasty, but still has a taste of burnt coffee.

Oh sweet jebus! This place was incredible. It was Labor day and our friend had plans to go home to New Orleans to visit his family but hurricane Gustav was headed to shore so he and his girlfriend had to cancel plans. I thought it would be great to suggest this place for brunch so he could have a taste of home. We walked through the loin and turned onto Turk only to find about 15 people waiting outside. That's the ONLY downside to this place. My suggestion is go to as a party of 2 because you get seated faster. The food was great. We got the beignet flight which was sooo yummy. My favorite was the craw fish, but the chocolate was also delicious. The craw fish had hot-gooey melted cheese with green onions.. mmm.For my main, I got the andouille sausage omelet with grits and a biscuit. The omelet was good but I demolished the grits in a blink of an eye. I highly recommend but expect a wait and be prepared to for the surroundings.

With a menu full of items with the words "cream" and "butter"... what's not to like?? Oh yea, my kind of place! While I'm not a fan of the surrounding neighborhood --  it could be worse -- Brenda's is seriously worth the trip. The place is still quite new, having only opened in September, but they're doing really well. The place was packed on a Friday morning at 11-ish. We chose to have a late breakfast, but you can have lunch there after 11am. I had the cinnamon french toast, which was delicious. The cream biscuit was incredible. I love me some gooood biscuits. Boy had the Adouille and Cheddar Omelette, which he said was really good. We also took an order of the Granny Smith Apple beignets, which were super sweet & yummy, even after being reheated a couple hours later. The servers were very nice -- no complaints there. The coffee is from Guatemala and super rich - so good, so good. My only wish is that they were closer to my apartment and further from the heart of the TL. Oh, well, I'll still go back. Totally worth it.

The Best Grits and Butter I've ever eaten, no one can make it like Brenda, not even Mom...Sorry Mom but Boxed Grits just ain't cuttin' it no mo'!  I think I must've had one of everything, no joke.  I think we started off with the Beignets, assorted with chocolate, apples and a savory one filled with crawfish.  The French Toast was Okay, but the Pancakes were delicious.  Way better than the French Toast.  You would think good pancakes were hard to find but lately it's been the other way around.  For Breakfast I had the Croque Monsieur, Ham layered with Gruyere cheese on sliced sourdough topped with Bechamel sauce which was divine and I always believe you can tell the quality of the place by how their coffee tastes.  Unfortunately my theory got a shoe shoved up it's butt, cuz' coffee was not so great but the food sure as hell was! The only bad part of Brenda's..HELLA SMALL!  I had to walk to the bathroom behind the cooks , do a cartwheel to get into the bathroom and finally pee sideways.  Plus, they don't take resies so if you get there as everyone else seems to, your ass out.  Put your name on the clipboard and glare at everyone else in the restaurant burning them with your eyes and mentally telling them to hurry the hell up cuz' your hungry!

I fantasize about eating here.  How is it that something that tastes so good could be so bad for you?   The crawfish beignet is out of this world, with the dark chocolate following closely.  The warm, soft cream biscuit melts in your mouth and creamy, rich grits will ensure you're full before you even start digging into your meal.  I've tried a variety of different omelettes and they have all been delicious.  The last one I tried had fried oysters in it, which was definitely an interesting twist on breakfast!  It was so filling that I could only finish half of it, so I boxed the rest and shared the spoils with a friend. The only bad thing on the menu is the coffee.  It's slightly sour, and no amount of sugar gets rid of that strange tang.  Otherwise everything else I've tried here is out of this world!

Not sure what else has been said about this place and what is left to say, but will tell you my experience [nothing like Alfred Y's, thank goodness]. LOCATION: We got there about 10:30-10:45 on Thursday morning. Not much traffic on the road to SF at that time and we found a meter with an hour max [I think it must have been a quarter for every 8 or 9 minutes, so it can add up and we set an alarm to feed the meter]. We waited in line with about 6-8 other people and added our name to the list. We waited about 20-30 minutes before sitting down. Driving by on Polk, it can be very miss-able. Look for the big taco bell, like Jonathon D. said. SMALL: It's a small place, but cute and hoppin' for a reason. Read the specials on the board. There's accolades on the wall, like Best Brunch - SF 2009, 4 of 5. I'd recommend keeping your group down to you and a friend. You're in and out in the hour - very efficient. Also, you can very much hear the conversation at the table next to you. I'm sure polite people pretend not to or tune out. I interject when helpful. Man-to-my-right: I'd like the regular french toast no bourbon pecan sauce. Me: Are you sure? That's what I'm having and I think you are going to want this sauce. Women-to-my-left: Ooo, they got beignets. Me: But those grits you had looked incredible. PRE-YELPING: I kinda wish I had been in my dining partner's shoes and was being dragged along, rather than the steadfast-yelper who developed a new restaurant crush on Brenda's with exceedingly high expectations including ordering Upside Down Pancakes... did I imagine a review mentioning these? I knew what I was ordering before I sat down... until these did not exist. THE SPECIAL: I did have the special Banana Bread Pudding French Toast with Bourbon Pecan sauce. My favorite part was swiping the whipped cream through the bourbon-caramel-type sauce and eating it plain. :) Wish it was sans chocolate, but really delicious. Could have used a few sliced/browned bananas, imho. SIDES & ENTREES: Also ordered a side of the sweet potato hash, which accompanied the Molasses Pork Chop [how I wish I liked pork] and they don't normally give out the sides to monitor quantity, but they made an exception and THANK GOODNESS, because it was AWESOME. Not incredibly *sweet*, much more seasoned and onion-y. And delicious. My compatriot had the goat cheese/shrip omelette, and loved it, though I did not try any. I did have a bite of her buttery, creamy grits. Which are the best grits I've ever had (even better than any I touched in GA and LA) and make me reconsider the apathy I had for grits. Soo good. BEIGNETS: We started with an apple beignet... well, for $5 we thought we were starting with one. For $5 you get 3. So we split one and two one home each. The waitress was jolly on the spot to take the dish, wrap it up, and hold it at the counter til our meal was finished. TEA: I had the watermelon tea. And eh. I would skip it next time. But I might have coffee, because it smelled good and I don't even like coffee!! Staff was friendly and got 'er done. Bill was cheap! $31 for two full breakfasts?! It's definitely down-home style, and a good experience one, two, three times. I don't need to be a regular, but there are a few other things I'd like to try. Including smothering some blackberry or apricot jam and butter [why get toast?!] all over that monstrous buttermilk biscuit, the Baked Brie en Croute, and mayhaps the phantom Pineapple Upside Down pancakes [Snooze maybe?]

On my first trip to Brenda's one Saturday morning, I consumed my first AND the last meal of the day in the same sitting. Portions are huge, and you want to taste every last bite! The hour and a half wait was totally worth it. On any given weekend, you're bound to wait a long time for a table (which is one of the reasons I avoided going for so long). Just grab some coffee and hang out on the sidewalk with the rest crowd who eagerly put their name on the wait list. Once you get inside, the demeanor of the staff changes from that of a prison-guard to a friendly grandmother excited to feed you. The place is tiny, with about 10 tables cozily organized into a small, dimly lit room. Our server was fantastic, and answered all of my questions about the menu. We started with the Beignet Flight, which was delicious. The chocolate was my favorite - the crawfish a close second. Next came a caramelized onion, shrimp and goat cheese omelet, accompanied with some perfectly prepared grits, and a fluffy, fresh biscuit (served with homemade chunky peach jam). Oh and the watermelon iced tea was delicious! Everything was amazing. No doubt I will be back.

AWESOME! This place was really just a stones throw away from the Monarch Hotel. Staying in the Tenderloin was a gamble. I was worried about the neighborhood. I didnt want to get raped or mugged while walking home from my food induced stupor. However, trust me on one fact, there is NEVER a short supply of mouth orgasiming food in the Tenderloin. I ordered almost everything off this menu. I got the cat fish bignets, Watermelon Ice Tea, grits, biscuits and the special that had fried oysters. Man, this place is ................DA BOMB! Brenda used to be the chef at Cafe Claudes, so I guess the awesomeness transfered to her own place in the Tenderloin.

Mon Dieu! This is THE place to go to for breakfast/brunch/lunch in San Francisco. I had a great experience at Brenda's. The food was rich, flavorful, satisfying and a wonderful value for a hard earned dollar! I had the bacon and egg tartine. This dish, served with a lovely semisweet tomato relish was just lovely. The acidity of the tomato cut through the richness of egg and bacon and added another dimension of texture and flavor. Even though the portion was not huge, I still ended up having to get a small box to tote my spoils home with me. My sweetheart had the fried eggs and grits with a fluffy, flaky, buttery, "who's your daddy" biscuit. I tried a bite with a wee bit of the preserves and biscuity goodness and  I couldn't help but smile. Outrageous! If you go to Brenda's you MUST have the iced tea with watermelon. It is a refreshing and not too sweet accompaniment to any of the items on the menu. I was impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the wholesome savory goodness of every bite since I had recently been to the analogous Oakland's Brown Sugar Kitchen and had been disappointed, left underwhelmed by a meal that did not live up to the hype. Brenda's, really deserves every bit of praise.

If only I could get away with trying everything on the menu. The beignet flight is a great idea for beignet newbie's like myself.  It's quite a good deal - four of these bad boys for only $8! A beignet flight consists of : Plain, Chocolate, Apple and Crawfish beignets. My thoughts: (1) Crawfish with cayenne, scallions and cheddar - holy moly!! Words can hardly describe how a-freaking-mazing this is. Next time I want four of these...to myself...no sharing. (2) Granny Smith Apple with cinnamon honey butter - like apple pie, but butter...i mean better! (3) The plain - sweet, cute, fluffy, no complaints here (4) Ghirardelli chocolate-filled - I'm a chocolate lover, but this was strangely the least exciting of the bunch Beignets and this life changing beverage they call watermelon tea would have been enough for me...but oh, we ordered more...we ordered more?!! Pre-Brenda's I had never had grits. Post-Brenda's I realized that I've lived a sad grit-less life.  I've been told the grits are extra delish here and I would hate to next try bad grits.  I guess I'll just have to go back for more! My Andouille & Chedder omelet was a top tier breakfast choice and even though I was stuffed, I continuously found myself reaching over for a taste of my man's Grillades and Grits. Upon getting ready to leave, my stomach was unable to handle anymore...but my eyes kept eating!  The patrons next to us were served crawfish eggs benedict and I'm definitely coming back for it. And the next table over? Ordered a Po-boy that almost made me want to sit back down for another round!   This breakfast experience requires strategic planning, possibly waiting outside in the rain, and the club (anti-theft device for your car) but that's all of no matter, because it's worth it.

Brenda's offers the city's finest for cholesterol-heavy, finger-licking, truly delectable french soul food. With decent prices and food packed with flavor, your tummy will leave full and satisfied. We started with the beignet flight - an awesome tasting of the fluffy filled pastries. The plain was good, but couldn't stand up to the molten chocolate or cinnamon apple pie-like beignets. There's also one savory crawfish selection, dusted with cayenne pepper instead of confectioner's sugar. The beef in the grillades and grits were packed with spices and flavor, complemented by two eggs any style and a buttery flaky biscuit. My boyfriend's catfish po'boy was perhaps the least impressive of our orders, but even then was still good. The watermelon iced tea was both refreshing and unique. My only complaint about Brenda's is, of course, the wait. We waited over an hour for two people, so be prepared. Once inside, the experience is pleasant - bustling conversation, friendly servers, and music reminiscent of New Orleans. I certainly wouldn't subject my arteries to Brenda's everyday, but would definitely head back again for a hearty, Cajun-spiced meal that differs from your everyday dining experience.

So if we hadn't made in in by 2:30pm on Saturday we wouldn't have been able to eat here! We waited a good 30 mins before being seated as the last group and man the wait was worth it! =) It was my sis's bf bday and I wanted to take him out for some good eats. He was pleased with the choice thanks to Yelp! Here is what we ordered: Sampler Beignets -This was a tasty treat. By order of taste: Crawfish and cheddar, Original, Ghiradelli Chocoalte, Apple. Apple was my least favorite. Crawfish was a bit salty but very good and who doesn't like chocolate? haha. Banana's Foster French Toast -It was mouth watering and a sugar rush. It was savory and delicious with the syrup. OH man. It was good, but a little too sweet for my taste. I would need something salty to balance it out. Nevertheless, Erich ate it all! Catfish PoBoy Sandwich -My sister ordered this and it was quite good. I liked that the catfish wasn't overly battered, but still had some coating with a lot of flavor. She liked the coleslaw the most. I didn't really taste much, but that was because everything else I ate had more flavor. Hometown Omelet Platter? (I don't remember the name) -I got the Hometown something. It was good that's all I know. haha. It was an omelet with oysters and bacon with potatoes and a homemade biscuit. IT was yummy delicious! I was going crazy eating everything, but I would have to say mine was the best. They even had homemade sauce I think it was peaches for my biscuit and man that was yummy. Watermelon Tea - I think it was ok. It has a licorice taste to it (could be the chicory root). I don't care much for licorice. Overall I would definitely come back again if I am in the Tenderloin. Parking wasn't that bad since we got parking right across the street. Plus my car didn't get robbed! haha.. The only thing is that you have to have a lot of change because you may be waiting for a long time and you need to fill the meter. Those meter guys are quick. We saw one pass by maybe 15 mins after we put in some change! Recommendation: Bananas Foster French Toast Beignets (not the apple)

Yes!!  I forgot to review this place!!  I swear the brunch line is way to long but my sister told me it was worth it.  I would call her every 20 minutes and she reassured me over and over... It will cure your hangover and any other ailment including hunger! Hot Damn!!  I had the Cat fish Benedict with potatoes and a biscuit.  It was to die for!!  I am craving it just thinking about it!!  Everything was hot and rich and melty.  The biscuit was worth the wait alone. My boyfriend had a ham and French cheese sandwich with fresh squeezed orange juice.  He was equally pleased!!    We just stopped talking for 20 minutes while we devoured our food!! Come bundled because the place is small and the door is always getting opened.  I found the waitress to be a lil pissy as well, but hey, I was probably grumpy, too, being a bit under the weather and all!!  I will definitely come back!

Brenda's was our last stop in SF before coming home. Parking was a hassle, but isn't that expected in SF? We arrived at the restaurant at around 11:30am and were told it would be about a 45 min wait for a table for 2. I put my name on the list and thought we would have enough time to go to Chinatown real quick to get some egg tarts. I swear we only took about 30 mins or so, but when we came back, my name was already crossed off with 4/5 names listed below. I thought, oh f*ck, I don't want to wait another 45 mins! But luckily, it only took about 10 mins to get a table. Service is pretty spotty. I guess I'm used to it in SF - a lot of small, busy restaurants that just want you to eat and get out. By the time we were ready to order, they were out of their pork chop special, which we were drooling over while standing outside, so we ordered the hangtown fry (oyster and bacon) special and grillades and grits. I loved the oysters, but the bacon had so much fat, it was unappetizing. I didn't really try much of the other dish (grillades and grits), but Henry said it was ok. The best part of the meal had to be the biscuits! We also ordered the flight of donuts (beignets) to go, which made my car smell wonderful. I thought I would like crawfish beignet, but the mixture of sweet and savory in this instance didn't appeal to me. The chocolate beignet was a little too rich and I ended up liking the original beignet the most.

I came with a friend on a Monday, for lunch, and had only a short wait after we added our name to the blackboard.  I had not expected such a small place - one row of tables against the wall with a small aisle in between.  Tables very close together, with the noise level quite high so that intimate conversation is definitely not possible.   I thought the service was only mediocre.  When we asked for water, it took five minutes to get it.  My coffee was cold before the requested sweetener came and the people next to us had gone, a new couple were seated and served before our orders arrived!  The table was so small, it could barely accomodate the dishes we'd ordered.  My friend's pancake arrived "blackened" - I've heard of blackened redfiish, etc, but NOT pancakes.   All in all, the food was good - the gumbo, red beans, hushpuppies, and cheddar grits were as good as any this Southern girl has ever eaten.  The side of andouille sausage was so well done, it was more like andouille jerky.  I've had much better fried chicken. I would definitely return to try some of the other dishes and to eat more of the hushpuppies!  I was disappointed that, though there are empty cans of Steens Pure Cane Syrup on every table, they don't serve it.  What self respecting Georgia girl can eat biscuits without that??

Yeah, five stars, it IS as good as it gets... and I've only had take out! I work near by and see this place crowded everyday... for good reason.  Take a step inside, hungry, and your stomach will be singing choruses and verses until you get served.  People dress up, so if you stay, put on a nice shirt... really, out of respect.  This place seems to put a lot of pride and spirit into their craft.   I've only had the shrimp po' boy and the gumbo... both beyond good, well prepared and bursting with flavor.  I have plans on bringing family, having their fried chicken, hush puppies and eventually breakfast! I can't wait! My boss, a big fatty, LOVES this place.  Unfortunately, it is closed for dinner on Monday and Tuesday... a bummer for diners, a major plus for me seeing the look of utter disappointment in my bloated boss when he found out first hand after an arduous walk!

I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting from Brenda's - but I walked away feeling I didn't get French NOR soul food, but some weird California bastardization of "soul" food. Fortunately we were a party of two and no one wanted the two remaining seats at the bar, so our wait was close to nil even though there was a long line that spilled out onto the street. I debated between the crawfish beignets and the pork belly grits, but in the end the pork belly won out (probably for the better, as some reviewers described the "beignets" as being more like hollowed out cornbread than fluffy donuts... No thanks!) The pork belly was spectacular.  It was crisp on the bottom and pull apart soft in the middle, with a softish skin on top. It would've been even greater if the skin were crunchy.  The grits were okay, but the spicy onion relish and cheese helped it all go down easy. My bf had the bacon and egg tartine and unfortunately the best part of his meal were the potatoes.  The scramble eggs looked curiously pale, and he said the cheese and bread were bland. Based on the glowing reviews I expected more. But I think it's misleading to call this restaurant "French" soul food.

Always loved the watermelon sweet tea, catfish po'boy (can't go wrong w/ fried fish & remoulade) & crawfish beignets.  Their fried chicken is also surprisingly good- crisp, flavorful & juicy. Recently discovered the sweet potato dumplings... Love!  It's very pasta like & perfect if you're into carbs, cream & seafood.  But hey at least there's veggies in it. Now they are open for dinner too, I can have Brenda's all day.  Or not.  (My jeans will thank me.)

Beignets and home made biscuits! The crawfish one was my favorite. The portions are HUGE so come hungry. The oyster scramble which was a special was the best by far. The eggs benedict with molasses ham, also a special of the day, was delicious. The creole veggie scramble was disappointing and was quite flavorless and way to cheesy. The hour wait was bearable because we were able to go one block over to Philz for some coffee. Everyone waiting for a seat at Brenda's seemed to have a cup of Philz in hand. Just a note: The place is tiny so be preapred to wait outside. Also beware of random people throwing stuff off the roof above. There were some guys throwing things like cables and pebbles at the people below. Kind of random and scary.

As if Brenda's REALLY needs another review, right? On both occasions that I patronized this quaint and cozy establishment for weekend brunch, I, like everyone else, had to put my name on the list and wait.  So my advice to future Brenda's weekend brunchers is: get there early if you can, dress appropriately, and hell, you might even consider bringing reading materials or a game to play with your dining partners. The food is definitely stick-to-your-ribs type of stuff.  With highlights in so many reviews, my friend and I had to try the beignet and watermelon iced tea.  Beignets remind me a bit of ox-tongue pastries except they're lighter and can come stuffed and/or dusted with powdered sugar.  My favorites were the crawfish and apple.  I'm sure the plain and molten chocolate ones were great too, but there's a lesson learned - these are to be enjoyed on-premise, as they are not the same once they're brought home.  There isn't a huge difference between the watermelon iced tea and blended watermelon juice that one can get at tapioca places and some restaurants, but the drink was sweet and refreshing nonetheless. From what I recall, the grits were a bit on the oily side and the sweet potato hash was delicious, but more than anything else, I love their biscuits.  They are huge and have great texture.

Hangtown Fry (4 stars) Shrimp + Grits (4 stars) Beignets Flight (3.5 stars) Granola Pancake (1/2 order) (3.5 stars) Watermelon Iced Tea Total = $50 bucks? Two things to note: 1. Beignets: the ones here are not the best. They are too doughy, thick, and HUGE. I've had them at two places, one in San Jose that is now closed and the other in Frisco, CO and both were phenomenal. PHENOMENAL! Plain beignets that were light and fluffy... I think the ones at Brenda's are just not up to par. 2, Shrimp + Grits: First time I tried them was in downtown San Jose. I thought it was delicious! Very delightful but not too heavy. Just enough flavor. The ones here are topped with cheese. Just way too much cheese that causes an oily layer to build up and get in the mix of the grits and cheese. The cheese then gets too stringy and thick.. just too much. Or unnecessary, I'd say? Aside from that, the food here is good... and service is standard. We came on a Sunday at 2:35pm (they close at 3pm) and there was still a wait! It's a tiny place though, which is the reason why.

Crawfish beignet, Chicory coffee, and grits, oh my! I'm not gonna lie, I wish I hadn't let myself be talked into ordering the Grillades & Grits (beef cutlets in Creole gravy), which I thought were delicious but not overwhelmingly so. It was pretty heavy and although I am probably teetering on sacrilege by admitting this, I only finished about half my plate. I really liked the grits and the generous refills of Watermelon Sweet Tea... and oh, that coffee! MmMmM I'd like to come back (yes, definitely at an earlier hour) and try the Croque Monsieur and have a whole order of Crawfish beignets to myself!

I absolutely hated this place. The two stars is for friendly service and the four star-average Yelp group think. We waited over an hour to get over-fried beignets w/ what tasted like frozen crawfish tails. I am not sure if crawfish are all up in SF bay but it sucked. I heard the gumbo was pretty good but didn't try any. The fried chicken w/ the secret recipe was also over-fried. The place was crammed with people, the seating was tight, and the cheap plastic tabletops moved. I knocked over my drink. Sooo not worth the wait.

I could talk about the wonderfully inviting atmosphere, the comfortable and friendly staff, or the tempting smells coming from the kitchen.  Alternatively, I could talk about how odd it is to find a place like this on the edge of the Tenderloin, where the always entertaining 19-Polk turns onto Eddy.  Or... Enough; I want to talk about the food.  Being from Virginia, I see the following things as requirements for a complete breakfast: bacon, eggs, grits, corned beef hash, and biscuits.  And, being a hopeless francophile, I'm always pleased when someone figures out a way to add a French touch to other cuisines.  Brenda's satisfies both of these desires, with a menu that could just as easily be mistaken for one from an exclusively American diner, or one from a cafe brunch in New Orleans. Since I arrived for lunch, I enjoyed a croque madame, coleslaw and a biscuit.  The sandwich was creamy and authentic, probably the best I've had in the US.  The coleslaw was spicy and crunch, with just the right amount of mayonnaise (read: very little).  The biscuit... Oh, the biscuit; what can I say?  Buttery, crumbly heaven, that's what. I am jonesing for another meal at this place and I just left 2 hours ago.  Yes, it's that good. -- EDIT - Two months later and this continues to be my pick for best breakfast in San Francisco.  The eggs benedict, when they have it, is the best I've ever had.

One of my favorite things about SF is that on any random corner you can find a hole in the wall that is hard to find and surprisingly satisfying, thus exceeding your expectations. We drove and walked around for a while trying to find it, tucked away right next to the taco bell/KFC. We ordered the Beignet Flight to share and I had the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette with potato hash and a biscuit. Beignet - My favorites were the plain and the granny smith apple, and although I love chocolate and do recommend trying the ghiradelli chocolate, it's a bit thick and strong for my taste. Coffee - very good! Andouille and Cheddar Omelette - It was so delicious. Better than any omelette I have yet had in the city, better than Dotties too (which I must plug in is highly overrated). The potatoes w/that salsa were a perfect combo. I recommend this if you come here.

Located in the (un)tenderloin, the food was worth arduous wait. Deliciously flavored crawfish beignets (not to be confused with "crayfish" :p) that were spicy just how I like, even if they were a bit crunchy. My french toast (the daily special) was great as well, but it was a little too much on the sweet side for me conquer all of it. Still, I'd definitely go back. Extra friendly wait staff. I went with my friend and her (amazingly well-behaved) 1 year old boy. The little one seemed to like the food more than everyone.   Laissez les bon temps rouler!

Despite the fact that this place is somewhat in the middle of the ghetto in Tenderloin once you step into Brendas you'll forget all about it. I have to firstly mention their watermelon ice tea! Super refreshing!!! Their chocolate beignets are gruuuuuub! Its like warm chocolate gooo spills out soon as you cut into it! Most of their breakfast menu is pretty good..but I usually only go for those two items. Also despite the fact that I live in OC and not SF..so when I do visit those are the two things that I have. They renovated and expanded. Its so much cleaner , its got a cool young hip vibe. Just expect there to be a wait..but keep in mind its well worth it!! I will be back again when Im in SF

Brenda's seriously is some good eatin', with stick-to-your-guts goodness, generous portions, and a friendly staff.  I had brunch there today, and five hours later, I'm still stuffed full.  I don't think there will be much of dinner going in! Let's start with the most obvious bit - Brenda's is small, no doubt about it.  If you're not there right when they open, I'm assuming, be prepared for a wait out on the street.  If it's a nice day, I'm sure it's fine, but on chilly days, it can be kinda brutal.  But wait you should, for it is worth it. Next time I go, I need to remember to just get a cafe au lait and beignets, and no more.  The cafe au lait is nicely blended, and the beignets are pretty damn good.  You can order plain, chocolate, apple/cinnamon, or crawfish...or get a flight and taste all four!  They are puffy doughy pillows of goodness, and will leave you plenty fat and happy.  The beignets are a little larger and tougher than I remember Cafe du Monde's being, but hey, it still works. I had an oyster/bacon scramble this time around, which was absolutely delicious.  Thick pieces of bacon, not burnt to a crisp, scrambled in with some breaded and fried oysters provided a savory, almost aphrodisiatic opening to the day (if you can count a 2:30pm start an opener to the day).  The biscuits are to die for, light and fluffy but dense and chewy once in the mouth.  And the grits - I usually don't like grits, but somehow, Brenda's has made them in such a way that I actually ate more than just a mouthful. The service has always been friendly and attentive, though two wait staff can sometimes be a little overwhelmed, but it's all forgiven by the time the first bit of food hits the palate. If you're looking for more than your standard brunch fare, or brunch jazzed up a bit, definitely head out to Brenda's...absolutely, totally worth it.

Party of 7?  Don't be silly.  If you've read about this place, you know it's small, so don't complain about the wait if you come with your entire posse. By the way, read Kevin L.'s review... he has good advice about the beignets - trust him, he's from New Orleans! Let me boil it down: It's awesome that such a great, cafe opened in a neighborhood that needs soul-warming good eats made with freshies from Heart of the City Farmers Market. It's awesome that the servers are super friendly, and quick without rushing you out. It's awesome that, according to 7x7, "To allow her time to spend with her six-year-old son, dinner service isn't in the plans for now."  And yes, if there are any supersensitive neo-feminists reading this, I would have said the same thing had Brenda been a father instead.  :) It's awesome that this place will run KFC out of the place next door within a few years *crossing my fingers and toes!!!*

OH MY GOODNESS!!~  I am so glad I found this place.  It's just a hole in the wall that packs them in.  Seriously, there's about 6 tables, a long counter, and no room to move...  But it also packs in the flavor! My friend and I were the very last table seated, and the wait took a good half an hour long, AT 2:30 IN THE AFTERNOON!  I started with their house special watermelon sweet tea and it's really good.  Not what I had expected but you get bits of watermelon and some herbage in it.  Very refreshing and tasty.  It would be great for a hot summer day. I got the special Hangtown Fry.  It is scrambled eggs with fried oyster and bacon.  I just couldnt pass both fried oyster AND bacon.  I wish the bacon was cooked a little more so it's nice and crunchy, but any bacon is good bacon!  The fried oyster was nice and crunchy on hte outside, and they did not skimp out either!  There was oysters EVERYWHERE!   The plate also came with biscuits and grits (you also have a choice of toast and hash browns but why would you get that when you can have grits and biscuits?)  The biscuits were nice and fluffy.  I wanted to split it in half and it pulled apart at the slightest tough, steaming hot inside.  There were also home made jam on the table, I didnt know it at first but our waitress was nice enough to point it out.  I think it was something like peach or apricot, I'm not sure, BUT IT WAS GOOD!!   But the part that took my heart was the cheese grits, oh the wonderful cheese grits.  IT WAS SO FREAKING GREAT.  The grits were cooked perfectly, it pulls apart fromt eh bowl and was not jsut a sloppy mess.  It was also packed in with yummy yummy cheese.  Trust me on this, these are like crack grits, once you had some, you are addicted! Finally, I was disappointed when they were out of the beignet flight because they were out of the crawfish ones.  Well just another excuse for me to go back again.  We got the apple ones and it was wonderful.  There's a pile of powdered sugar on top, and I love sugar in its pure form.  The skin was crispy and the inside was pillowy with yummy apple bits.  I cant compare it to the stuff in New Orleans because I've never been but I'll say this is probably one of the best in California! This is a great find, and pretty hard to spot too.  I wish they would expand so the wait isnt so long.  But I'm pretty sure they'll lose part of their charm by doing so too.  Either way, the food is roll over and fall asleep good and I LOVE BRENDA!!

For right now... having not tried the Beignets that everyone has been talking about, 3 is all I'm capable of giving. I ordered the oyster poboy and a watermelon tea. Also leeched some gumbo off my buddy. Gumbo = pretty tasty. I like it. I would order it. Oyster poboy = mispelling of POOBOY. At first bite my mouth was feelin' it. Not bad, not bad... a couple bites in and it started tasting extremely fishy, and had me questioning the freshness of it. Watermelon tea = iced watered down watermelon juice... not really worth the $$ in my eyes. I probably wont' be going back anytime soon. I'll update this review if I ever go back and try the beignets...and maybe I'll have breakfast instead. Oh, and this is one of those places in SF that is super tiny and makes you wonder if the establishment was purposefully chosen for its tinyness to up the hype. Iono~~ Just something to think about.

Brenda's has great food, can't deny that. Two thumbs up for the [Beignets]. When waffling over which to choose why not split a flight? We did and that gave us a taste of the crawfish, apple, plain and [chocolate] (which was my fave). [Biscuits], amazing, flaky, fluffy and even better when topped with their jam. Even their [grits] were good and flavored different than I've ever had em. My friend said she tasted a hint o cheese. I had the [grillades] for my brunch entree and it was filling and hearty due to its savory spices. The service? MEH! Okay, I understand that it's a popular place meaning we have to wait. It's busy. I get it. But that doesn't give staff the right to be curt, abeit a little rude if we ask  questions we don't know the answers to. We waited a little longer than normal for our flight and asked if it could be brought out before our food to which the lady who I'm assuming was the manager that morning made a condescending remark about us not getting it yet because it was "busy." My friends wanted to try the watermelon tea but weren't sure if they wanted a whole to themselves so they decided to split. When asking our waiter for another glass he said he couldn't do it and then walked away without explanation. It was only when he heard us audibly asking ourselves "why?" that he came back and matter-of-factly explained that drinks were automatically re-filled. And that two cups would mean someone was getting one for free. Did we know they refilled? No. Thanks, you've suceeded in making us feel impatient, foolish and cheap. I don't think that should happen when the environment is inviting. Makes me iffy about returning. I guess because it's a bustlin' establishment the management can afford to be brief to customers, not cool.

We started with the beignet flight, eating only 2 of the 4 because we knew we after seeing them we would be full, and wouldn't be able to take our eggs to go. If you get these, only order 1 other dish and share it. Everything is portioned big, and you won't be able to finish. I had some egg/potato special. I was brought bacon, which I didn't eat or order (I hate bacon, I know crazy) but wasn't charged for it either. Too bad I don't like it, I could've had free bacon which some people may think is better than sex. My friend had an omelet which she liked. The best part of the meal was the biscuit for sure. We came on a week day, so the wait was not so bad. We sat at the bar, which is very cramped and had to watch ourselves eating in the mirror, a little weird.

Brenda's has fast become one of my favorite places to eat, anywhere. The food makes your arteries cry, your soul sing and your eyes weep butter. I would eat this stuff any time of day, any day of the week, notwithstanding the beignets, which I found to be very disappointing. On weekdays, especially towards closing time, the wait is bearable. I have waited anywhere from five minutes to an hour and a half (on a Saturday morning/afternoon) depending on the day. From the regular menu the most tantalizing item is the grillades and grits, two braised cutlets in gravy, served with two eggs and a pool of the best grits ever-- creamy and redolent of that sweet corniness. I always pine for a bit more gravy with the grillades, but the dish is not without succulent moist bites all through the end even without. Omelets are great, and the specials are often tempting enough to eschew the regular heavy-hitters. Molasses pork chops with sweet potato hash encompassed the best of the sweet-salty combination, and the thin chops were tender and juicy. Wash it all down with some watermelon sweet tea, and how could you crave anything else? I've yet to try any of the lunch items because breakfast/brunch tempts me every time. But I've got my eye on the croque monsieur and the shrimp po'boy. Next time, I always tell myself.

THE BISCUITS ... omg, you must get a biscuit. Why would you get toast? You can make your own toast. Can you make your own biscuit? Get the biscuit. GET THE BISCUIT!!! Otherwise, I wish they had some spicier options and maybe didn't make me feel guilty for eating so much food ... no, I guess that's okay.

My opinion of Brenda's is unchanged; I still heart her food and the general atmosphere in this place, which is truly my favorite spot in SF. HOWEVER. I revise my review to issue a public service announcement...please do not come here if you are a group of 8+! The restaurant is just too damn small, and your large party will make for a miserably long wait for everyone who follows you. On a recent visit, I stood waiting as two - TWO - groups of 10 were sat before me. If I were planning a large group outing, my love of Brenda's would be countered by the fact that I don't want to be the asshole who consumes the whole restaurant with my party of thousands. It almost makes me wish Brenda would institute a policy like those I've seen at other small joints, and not seat groups larger than 6 - 8....ah, someday. Someday.

I really like food, but I never really considered getting emotional about it. Until the day I ate at Brenda's French Soul Food. For some perspective, my grandma came from the south (Georgia & Louisiana), and as such had an apparent mission to create a fat little kid outta me by feeding me good southern food. She died and I live in So-Cal (a vacuum for good southern food) and so I cannot tell you how excited I was to read about Brenda's while planning my most recent trip to the Bay area. It started when we arrived and had to wait a few minutes for a table. I seriously got pissed reading the daily specials because I knew that there was no way I would be able to try everything on it. Anyway, enough whining... on to the food! Jambalaya - was fantastic. Great consistency, thick, well spiced with a good earthy flavor. I mention that earthy flavor because there really is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to jambalaya, sometimes you'll get tomato, others it's almost creamy, this one was deep. Do it on a cold day. Catfish Poboy - Simple, fried fish (not greasy), slightly spicy sauce, soft bun,  w/ slaw and some fries. Seriously, K.I.S.S. and you'll almost always get a good meal. I'm not going to tell you that a PoBoy is the next culinary nouvelle vague, but it's still a damn fine lunch! Catfish beignets - I'd never had them, had to try it. They're not bad and in the right circumstance they'd be awesome (paired with an Abita lager). But I think that for the same reason I'm reluctant with empanadas, I'll stick the the more traditional sweet beignets next time. On a last note, the french toast and pancakes coming out to the other diners around us looked just obscenely good, and seemed to be as evidenced by the muffled comments coming from those around us with mouthfuls.

We were a bit discouraged by all the people waiting outside but since we were already there we figured we might as well go through with it. After putting our name down, we got some Philz coffee to help keep us warm while waiting. It took about an hour for us to be seated, could have been longer but a lot of people on the list left. Crawfish Beignets: Delicious! These came out piping hot and when you cut it open, all the goodness oozes out. Banana's Foster French Toast: I think these may beat Zazie's French Toast. So good! Eggs Benedict Florentine: The eggs were a bit more cooked than they should be. Instead of an English muffin, they use a biscuit. I love buttery biscuits but wow, these were just too much. They may have been good on their own but were too overwhelming in this dish, I couldn't taste anything else. After a few bites, I ate the toppings and side but left the biscuits. Watermelon Ice Tea: Pretty good, would have been better if it was actually cold. I would come back for the Beignets and French Toast! The wait wasn't so bad with good company and some hot coffee. :)

Ridiculously good beignets and biscuits. I had the pork belly/grits/egg special, which was spicy and savory. Really good. Others had the gillades and grits - also excellent. Chicory coffee was nice - don't see that too often. Worth the wait.  Not in the greatest part of town, though, and don't venture east from Brendas unless you're looking to buy some crack.

Came here a few weeks ago and gah-lee the food was delicious here ! I tried the oyster dish with a sample of each and it was really good ! I'm not a big fan of oyster but the way they made their oysters made me wanted to order more. I also ordered the crawfish beignet and mm mm mm it was really good too. The bread was perfect outside and the fillings inside went well with the outsider. Lastly, my main dish was the shrimp and grit it was really good ! The dish was really hearty and filling , it really was comforting to the soul eating that. Aside from the food the service was good as well regardless of the business . The servers were attentive and gave us what we needed. Lahvvv lahhvv this place !

We dodged the lines by going on a weekday. Four of us shared: hangtown fry (delicious!) shrimp & grits (a bit oily/greasy, but good flavor) pumpkin pancakes (a bit bread-like, but good) BFC (biscuits are GREAT) Gotta try the watermelon tea (not too sweet). Would definitely go again.

The epitome of soul food good cookin'!  Every taste I had at Brenda's was how I imagine authentic soul food should taste.  I picked my little brother up from the airport when he came home last November from Korea and on the spur of the moment I was like let gets some good old American eats.  So we went to Brenda's. I, once, watched Paula Dean cook grillades and grits once on TV, and Brenda's had it.  I ordered that to share and my brother ordered one pancake.  We should have ordered the beignets.  DOH!  Anyway, it was all gravy.  Literally. The grillades were tender and drenched in salty delicious gravy that complimented the smooth creamy grits.  Yummers.  The over-medium eggs also cut through the savory with more creaminess.  Oh man, just thinking about that dish makes me wanna bathe in it or kick my diet to the curb. Yeah, I know I've mentioned this extreme elimination diet a lot, but this time I'm not cheating!  Except, I would for Brenda's grillades and grits.  And if you noticed, I have not said that about any other dish I've reviewed today.  Oh and I'll throw in the beignets while I'm at it.  =P

Ever since I moved to San Francisco, I've been actively participating in 7x7's Big Eat SF. The list is made up of 100 Things to Try Before You Die. Brenda's came in at #42 suggesting the Fried-shrimp po'boy. Excited to go, I went with a couple of friends around 11am on the weekend. We anticipated a long wait, but it wasn't bad. Once you arrive, there's a sign-up sheet for those busy hours. Since it was around lunch we waited about 30mins. But boy was it worth the wait! The interior is small yet cozy. One of the walls displayed a big mirror, which opens up the entire place. The maroon painted walls compliment the relaxed environment and added to it's southern feel. The menu was simple and easy to read, while daily specials were posted on the mirror. My friends and I proceeded to order and came up with a couple different dishes. We ordered: - The Beignet Flight. - Hushpuppies - The Andouille and Cheddar Omelette - A couple of Catfish Po'boys (because shrimp was not available) The beignets were amazing! I recommend getting the flight because it includes 4 different beignets (Plain, Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple, & Crawfish). The hushpuppies were spicy yet deliciously filled with a creole flavored cheese. The main courses were plentiful and served in good portions. You definitely pay for what you get. (Ranging from $8-11). Each main course usually comes w/ potato hash or grits, plus a cream biscuit or toast. The omelet was cheesy and rich with flavor. The added sauce piquante gave it a nice louisiana taste. The catfish po'boy sandwiches were just as good. Being served on soft dough bread complimented the crispy, crunchy taste of the fried catfish. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and experience there. The customer service was great. I look forward to my next meal there as I explore more southern comfort food. TIPS for my next visit: My friend Paul recommended ordering the Watermelon Ice Tea, as it's one of his favorites. My other friend Connie also recommended ordering the food to-go, so I wouldn't have to wait in line.

Was here for an early dinner before Les Mis.  We started with the Oyster Flight for a taste of each - voodoo is my favorite, but all 3 flavors are good. My hubby had BFC - moist and tasty. I had the shrimp grits - mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!  Then the beignets came - plain, apple and ghirardelli chocolate. Lordy, Lordy, Lordy! Good thing I was splitting them with my husband. Becky's great! She kept making sure I had watermelon iced tea to wash down all this sinful goodness. Very attentive staff. Will return to try other items on the menu...or have another serving of shrimp grits!!

Finally, great soul food in a great looking place in a great location. Brenda's has been on my list forever, and I'm so glad I've tried it. I love soul food and cajun and all generally southern style cuisine (save TexMex- blegh), so of course I had to try Brenda's. I was not expecting it to be so cute! It's a handsome little joint (seriously- little, maybe 20 tables total?)- gilded ceiling, black wood trim, cement walls.  Felt very airy and open and chic. The food- spectacular. Had the beignets, which judging from the reviews seem to be a staple. DELICIOUS. Seriously, undeniably scrumptious. If you like soft, flaky, spicy, creamy or steamy- get these. Get one more too, you'll want one. Split and order of fried chicken and had a croque monsieur to myself. My tab leveled out around $22, not bad considering I was stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey. Word of advice however- this place, as I've mentioned, is TINY. Very, very small. If you come at peak hours expect a generous wait, but from the hordes of people pooling outside the front door as we left, and well- coming from my own opinion- it's well worth the wait.

My boyfriend and I went here for Brunch one Saturday and boy were we pleasantly suprised! First, my bf has an allergy to wheat.  Not only can he not eat wheat, but his food needs to be prepared seperately from anything - cutting boards, counters, etc. - that could contaminate it.  This ALWAYS causes some dilemna in ordering food. But the wait staff here was super-friendly and eventhough, like most, they had no idea what a wheat allergy was, they were really helpful in helping him pick out something he could eat and also very attentive in letting the kitchen know that it needed to be prepared away from wheat products. The food was also really good!  And the ambiance is festive and nice. I hope this little gem can find its way in the neighborhood!

French-Soul food in civic center, NO WAY!  When I saw that Sun's had closed down and Brenda's was opening in its' place, I couldn't wait to try it.  Here's what what I have had so far Grillades and Grits-  Kind of has a Filipino taste to it, like Kalderetta.  To those non Filipinos it is a tomato based sauce with onions and spices.  The meat was really tender and almost no need for a knife. Craw fish Beignets-  One order comes with 3 pieces.  Be prepared to share with some one. House Salad-  The mixed greens were fresh and the dressing was light. Combo Po'boy-  I asked for the shrimp and oyster po'boy.  SO DELISH!  The batter was light so you could taste the shrimp and the oyster were done just right. Watermelon Iced Tea-  Slight taste of mint  and a slice of watermelon...really hits the spot.

Before living in San Francisco, I rarely went out for breakfast.  I use to feel breakfast food was so boring compared to lunch and dinner food.   Brenda's French Soul Food proved me wrong.  There was nothing generic about the breakfast I had this morning.  I had a sampler of the four beignets, and the Creole Veggie Omelette. The sampler of the four beignets is a a great deal for $8.  Each beignet is big enough so that it can easily be split between two people but it's too filling for two people unless you are just splitting one additional meal.   The sampler included a plain beignet, chocolate beignet, granny smith apple beignet, and crawfish beignet.    Collectively I would give the beignets a high three rating.  The crawfish beignet was particularly interesting as it was almost like beignet meets hot pocket. Though the beignets were very good, the standout dish for me was the Creole Veggie Omelette with potatoes and a biscuit.  This dish was unique and delicious.   Again veggie omelette, you think a little egg and a few vegetables, very boring but not Brenda's Creole Veggie Omelette.  The egg was cooked perfectly, slightly brown on top and the perfect middle between too fluffy and too flimsy.  The omelette had a slight spicy kick to it, and the ingredients were abundant and delicious.  The biscuit was definitely one of the better if not best biscuits I have had in the city.  It was perfectly crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and buttery.  For someone that usually prefers crisp potatoes, I loved the soft potatoes at Brenda's as the potatoes were nicely seasoned, and I wouldn't have wanted the texture any other way.     Brenda's French Soul Food proves breakfast wasn't meant to be boring.

Soul food that had good amounts of soul.  Lots of rich ingredients, buttery grits and biscuits...  And beignets.  Nuff' said.   The menu will have something for everyone, and the daily specials should be enough to sate the old coot who sits in the corner and goes there every morning for breakfast.

This place is wonderful. The staff is attentive and have just enough attitude to make you feel like you're visiting your friends house for some good eatin' I have only been twice but everytime its been enough to make me come back for more. The space is small and can be a bit crammed, but common now, everyone is on top of everyone here in SF. You might pass by it if you're not looking, so be careful. And get the beignet sample platter (not a fan of the apple...but egh it's worth trying)!!

The best breakfast I have ever had the pleasure of eating. This place is small but lovely. I ordered the Creole Veggie Omelette. Oh my stars. It was a huge portion. It came with potato hash and a biscuit, which tastes spectacular if you add the peach preserves. My friend ordred the Bacon and Egg Tartine with Grits. Now I've never had grits but they were mighty good. I wanted to try their beignets but I was way too full. Next time for sure. Pictures here: http://meltung.blogspot.…

If you're gangsta like me and you're comfortable stepping over hobos as you walk past crack dealers and prostitutes, then you feel right at home in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. You see... I'm from the city of Angels and I am used to chillin' in the barrio with the homies sippin' on Gin n' juice -- in my Chevy (six-fo' Red to be exact) with witches on my side and snitches on my back. For the uninitiated, Brenda's features soul food/cajun food/creole. The absolute best. Maybe I am exaggerating since I am basing my review on one visit, but it was insanely good. So good, it's worth going into the Tenderloin district for this food. What did I have you ask? The special of the day: Red beans with dirty rice and Andouille sausage. I washed this down with coffee. This was for breakfast of course. I ate with 3 other people who were also very pleased with their meals. (They don't have nearly as much street cred as I do, but are pickier eaters than I am. Clearly, I was their protection on this venture into the ghetto.) Is this place crowded? Yes. Is it in a shady neighborhood? Yep.  Is there a line in the morning to get breakfast? Of course. Is it worth the wait? YES - IN CAPITAL LETTERS. More importantly..... Will I return to this place? HELL YA! Highly recommended. Go there.

The biscuits... they haunt me in my dreams. The chef has made sacrifices to the biscuit lords. Get one while you can! Seriously, the greatest biscuits I've ever had the privilege of smashing into my face. I've never had French Creole brunch and this was a great experience. I ordered the crawfish beignets. The dish comes with three large puffy beignets filled with a crawfish mixture with plenty of paprika and green onions. The flavors seem very authentic. My three brunchmates all ordered the goat cheese and shrimp omelets, which was oozing with goat cheese. I tried their sides: standard wheat toast, fresh fruit, savory grits, and the BISCUITS. Ok, first, the grits were alright. Can't say I've had them more than twice in my life, but I'd probably prefer them sweet. Maybe brown sugar instead of a pool of salty melted butter. And the biscuits... crumbly, soft, velvety, melt in your mouth, perfectly buttery, absolute carb bliss. Also, really great coffee and the prices are awesome! Almost every other breakfast/brunch place I've been charges more than here and for mediocre dishes with dry, humiliating biscuits. The interior space is also very elegant and a bit rustic. Definitely going back the next time I'm in SF.

Crawfish beignets: Extremely filling (1 order = 3 large beignets) and gooood Sweet watermelon tea: Refreshing, comes with free refills Grillades and grits: I might have just been too full, but these were just ok. Best part was probably the buttery cream biscuit. Catfish po'boy: Didn't order this but I stared enviously at anyone who ordered it-- will get this next time! Everything here comes in giant portions for a reasonable price, but sadly a lot of the dishes wouldn't hold up well as leftovers (lots of fried, runny, or mushy items) so I didn't see many people boxing up their food.  Unfortunately there's a charge for sharing, but 2 main dishes + beignets for 3 people is probably already more than enough. Our wait at 12pm on a weekday was about 30 minutes, but the lunch rush died down around 1:15.

I will so totally be back here. The staff is really friendly and very attentive, the place is small and cozy, and the food is great. I had the creole vegetable omlette with grits and a biscuit. The omlette was awesome, the creole powder stuff really made it stand apart from other omlettes. The grits were different than I was used to, but by no means is that a bad thing. I loved them, they were just as good as the ones my grandma used to make, and my grandma made some serious 5 star grits. The best  part of this meal though was the biscuit. Mine came fresh out of the oven and was PERFECT! It was flaky outside, but the insides were so soft that it fell apart when I tried to spread butter on it. The house-made peach  jam that I put on it made it even better, and the waitress informed me that sometimes they have mango jam..... I will so be back for this. The service is a little slow but it is totally worth the wait and I will be back to try more and more and more of their menu.

I also wanted to love it. Went for lunch. There was about a 10 minute wait - not bad. I got a cup of gumbo that was very good, a side of grits that was also very good and a caesar salad that was OK. The anchovies came on the side and the salad was barely dressed otherwise. The greens were nice and fresh but the flavors never became integrated even with much mixing. My wife got the shrimp pot pie and it came with a big gooey layer of cheese that she thought was unnecessary. Worse the shrimp inside were so overcooked they were practically inedible. The salad that same on the side was very good and the mustard-based dressing was tasty. We got the flight of beignets - the chocolate was very good, the apple and plain were OK, and the crawfish one was OK.  The strawberry jam seemed homemade and had nice flavors from the spices in it. Do not arrive having to use the bathroom - you have to squeeze by the cook at the grill and there may be a second cook plating in the same narrow space and the floor is greasy-slippery if you're not wearing non-skid soles. Funny note was the bathroom contained a bunch of bandaids, hair gel and a microwave cookbook...hmmm.

I went on the Monday of a 3 day weekend and waited almost 2 hours to be seated (I was part of a group of 3).  I know it's hard to believe, but the wait was totally worth it.  It wasn't so bad because I was with people I liked and we just talked outside. YES, the beignets are HELLA good.  YES, the watermelon iced tea is HELLA good (and there are free refills)!  If you like grits, order their delicious grits.  If you don't like grits...well, you should still get grits.  I feel like everything is good.  Breakfast is served all day, and you can totally order food to go for after you're done to give to, say, your sexy girlfriend who had work and couldn't come to lunch with you. You have to walk through a narrow cooking area to get to a tiny bathroom.  Parking wasn't a problem at all that day, but it's 6 minutes per quarter.  I snuck into 2 nearby laundromats to break bills into quarters so that wasn't a problem, as long as you don't mind paying a bajillion quarters while waiting/eating. Be careful because this spot closes at 3pm, and if you get there at say 2:30 you might not get onto the waiting list since they close it off once it gets close to closing. The best is when someone who works there comes outside to read names off the waiting list, and everyone standing outside prays to God they've left because the just want to eat.  Yay!

Please hire a busperson!  When we arrived, there was a line of people, but at least four table/bar areas were empty.  The problem appeared to be two people were doing all the serving and cleaning, so those four areas hadn't been cleared from the previous diners.  If one person solely cleaned and two served, I'd add another star to my review.  The fried oyster poboy was delicious, as were the chocolate beignets.  The french fries were kinda bland.   Oh, once we did get seated, we didn't get silverware and napkins until halfway through our meal.

Started our brunch with the beignet flight and I quickly fell in love with Brenda (whoever and wherever she is, and I'm a straight female) as soon as the bit of crawfish beignet entered my mouth. I thought it was rather naughty of her to take something I don't care much for (beignet or doughnut in the more familiar form) and stuff it with carefully spiced crawfish concoction) and turn it into something I dream of at night. I really enjoyed my fried catfish Eggs Benedict with its beautiful creole Hollandaise sauce generously smothered as to allow the biscuits to soak some of its creamy goodness. (alternatively there's molasses ham, fried chicken, or Florentine). The hash I chose as my side was seasoned and cooked so perfectly, I had to take home the little bit of potatoes left on my plate. Easily one of the very best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. This place is receiving high ratings obviously for the quality of food and it's fresh take on Creole cuisine. To be expected from Cajun food, what's on the menu tends to be on the creamy and rich side, but not greasy at all. Service was  good with a steady stream of good coffee into our cups. To top it off, the soft modern interior makes for a nice ambiance for brunch in the city. Still, you'd probably have to wait awhile to get seated if you arrive for a weekend brunch after 9:00AM. I'm not one to wait for food despite how good it is, but Brenda's is one of the few I'll make a concession for, especially when I have out-of-towners. Utilize your wait to have some Philz Coffee on Van Ness. Chances are, there will be a crazy line at Philz too so you'll end up waiting in line while waiting in line. Fun, huh?

great breakfast, but beware the crackheads outside!  Not that they bother you, but still, got some real weirdos in this neighborhood. Small little place in the tenderloin, got some great food.  service is really good, go for the beignets...totally awesome!  got the traditional, chocolate filled and savory kinds of beignets.  try 'em all i say! go early so you don't have to wait...i got there just around opening, by the time i left it was crazy crowded with a long line!   I think they are now open for dinner too, not sure if there is different things on the menu for dinner, but would like to try, just try to find good parking so you can avoid the crazy people.

Got here early before our show (5:00) to try the menu. There was plenty of seating and the wait staff was very attentive. Watermelon ice tea for the mrs. And a nice ipa for me. The menu is not overwhelming, but it difficult to decide on what to eat. A cup of gumbo and the oyster slider to start. The gumbo is thick and fully of flavor, no hot sauce required! The oyster were off the hook, almost wanted to order a dozen for dinner. The shrimp grits for the wife and the fried chicken dinner for me. I don't like grits but when I tried my wife's I think I could eat the whole plate. The fried chicken is tender with a little Cajun kick. For desert the trio of beignets! Plain, chocolate and apple, what a combo!!  Overall this place is deserving of 6 stars! Special shout out to our waitress Becky!

Okay okay fine, I give in. Not only did Brenda personally message me to thank me but they took my advice about seating on a first come first serve basis and put it into effect. I haven't gone back yet, but my cousin was just there this weekend and affirmed that the seating system had indeed changed. I'm genuinely touched and really happy. Go democracy and go YOU, Brenda. You are badass. Five stars and no regrets. :)

3.5 Stars. Brenda's is such a cute little place for breakfast!  It's really small so I'm glad I went on a Monday morning when most people are at work.  At 10:45am, I got a seat for two right away. Beignets - This was my first time having these so I didn't know what to expect but they are much lighter than the American donut.  My bf originally had these at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and said they are more gooey there.  One order of the regular is $4 but there are 3 big pieces!  It looks like there is a lot of powdered sugar but it's necessary since without it, the beignets would be a bit bland.  They come out piping hot though... even steaming.  Next time I want to try the beignet flight: chocolate, granny smith apple, crawfish. Egg and Bacon Tartine ($9) - I got hash and this was my favorite item of the dish!  I was expecting shredded potatoes but these are actually seasoned potatoes.  Sad that they came out a little cold but even then, they were still flavorful.  If you're unfamiliar like I was, a "tartine" is an open-faced sandwich.  It was topped with bacon, then a THICK layer of scrambled egg, then a thin layer of gruyere, with the tomato-bacon relish on top of a French roll.  Without the relish, this sandwich would be nothing!!  Okay maybe not exactly but the relish is sweet and tastes like tomatoes but not tart like tomatoes.  I wanted more of it.  The eggs were a little too thick for my liking so I scraped it off. I had a bite of the bf's Andouille and Cheddar Omelette; the sausage was tasty and the cheese was gooey!  He got less hash than I did but his dish came with a biscuit!  The biscuits were also lukewarm when they came out (seeing a trend?) and on the flaky side. During my meal, I desperately needed to go to the bathroom but it didn't seem anywhere in sight.  The server told me I just have to go through the kitchen and it was slightly daunting.  The floor is very oily and I kept envisioning myself tripping over onto a hot stove.  Do not rule the possibility out because the stove was literally inches from me!  I ended up leaving my hat here so I came back a couple hours later to get it and found it on the floor by my table.  Thanks?   I want to come back for lunch.

Definitely worth the wait. Stay the course and you won't be disappointed. I met up with some friends here at noon and we didn't sit down until 1:30 because we had a group of 7. We basically took up a third of the seating in this tiny place. While waiting outside on a sunny December afternoon, we sneaked peeks through the window at what people were eating. :P All the beignets are good. We ordered two flights for the table and split them. I like the combo of sweet and savory. Crawfish and cheddar was really really good. Chocolate, apple, and plain were tasty as well. If you come with at least four people, order a flight to share. Otherwise, they're pretty big and the portions for the brunch plates are really generous. I ordered the corned beef hash special. MMMM...soo good! Nicely seasoned, with a little bit of a kick, but not too much. A good blend of corned beef, potatoes, veggies, and seasoning, all mushed up, pan fried, and served with three eggs and a biscuit (or grits).I like to get my eggs over easy so I can later break the yolks and smother my hash in it. The biscuits are HUGE and super good. Really really filling though. I'm such a fatty, I can't believe I finished everything. Geez. :O An hour later, I could barely get up and walk outside. lol!! Oh, the meters in the area all seemed to be 1hr limit, but there's a garage on Larkin north of Eddy that's $2.50/hr. Connected to some hotel. Come early or late, maybe before 11 or after 2. At noon with a group more than 4, be prepared to wait. Hopefully the weather is nice. :)

I met up with an old friend, Carol L, who is also an Elite yelper and she recommended that we (Carol L., myself, and our respective BFs) hit up Brenda's bright and early for their decadent and oft-spoken about brunch.  We arrived at 9:15 a.m. and the crowds hadn't formed outside, so we were seated immediately.  The restaurant opens its doors at 8 a.m., so we were glad to have arrived before the rush! I tend to judge a brunch based on their eggs benedict, my go-to meal.  Carol L. was the resident expert, so she helped us all decide on our meals.  As a whole, our table ordered: 1.) One order of crawfish beignets 2.) Molasses Ham Eggs Benedict w/ a side of potatoes 3.) Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict (x2)  w/ potatoes and a bowl of grits 4.) Veggie omelette 5.) A cup of gumbo 6.) Watermelon iced tea (Carol's BF, the rest of us had coffee) The buttery rich homemade biscuits that made up the eggs benedict was so filling that, despite how delicious and enjoyable the dish was, became too overbearing to finish.  I wanted to savor all the biscuits but I wouldn't have had any room for the beignets or anything else. Also note - if you don't like the syrupy sugar taste of molasses, the ham eggs benedict is not for you.  The fried catfish might be better suited because the flavor of the catfish paired with the creole hollaindaise is a wonderful balance, although very decadent.   The crawfish beignet was the highlight of the meal because of it is a shining example of French soul food.  Dusted lightly with cajun powder as opposed to powdered sugar on its dessert counterpart, the dish was filled with stewed crawfish in creole spices.  My bf is from NC, and so we can always appreciate some good soul food, even if the interpretation is a little different. Overall, Brenda's left a great first impression on us and I'm sure I'll return for the dessert beignets in the future.   Four stars for ambiance, good service, great food and even better company!

the apple beignets. SO GOOD! The Mr and I ordered the flight, couldn't possibly have finished all of them. I did like the sweet ones better, but possibly because in my mind, they were dessert. The crawfish beignet was GOOD but a little odd because it was so unexpected. I ordered the shrimp and goat cheese omelette. OMG I LOOOOOVE GOAT CHEESE! It was good - no amazing. I also had my first experience with grits here; uhm they are ok, but nothing to write home about. The Mr had the Egg and Bacon Tartine, and I thought he was going to die from happiness. He kept saying, and I quote " this is the best restaurant in SF". After looking around and drooling over everyone else's food, we vowed to return on our next trip - and i will order the oyster po'boy or oyster anything.  Omg the po'boys looked amAAAzing. We lucked out by arriving earlyish on a Monday, parked a bit farther away (where there is freeee 2 hr street parking!) and walked in - waited for maybe 10 minutes! While we were eating, there were a bunch of parties that came and had to wait for a while.

I don't get the hype. On a visit to SF, I had lunch with a friend here. I suggested Brenda's because of its great reviews on yelp. My friend was excited to try it because she saw all the great reviews, too. Got here around 11:30am on a Monday, and there was a line. We waited about 20 minutes until we were seated. The place is a lot smaller than I had expected, but I was still open minded. We ordered what our server recommended -- The Hangtown Fry and the Shrimp & Grits. What a let down.  I was expecting really good food, but all I got was decent. It's good, but not worth the wait. And not worth 4 stars. Btw, the watermelon iced tea just tastes like water with a slice of watermelon in it.

There's a reason why "beignet" is pronounced "ben-YAY" - after you eat one, you simply cannot help but proclaim to the world how happy the little ball of fried dough made you.  We split one beignet flight between the four of us and it was the perfect taste of different types of beignets - savory, sweet, plain...all delicious. I ordered the shrimp & grits, which was amazing, and amazingly heavy.  The biscuits were so soft and fluffy, and is perfect for dipping in the grits.  I cleaned my plate, fully knowing that later on I'll need to run twice as hard at the gym. The waitress was impossibly nice, and did not mind repeating the specials 50 times because we were too hungry to register it the first time she said them.  She was also the one who recommended the shrimp and grits to me.  BEST REC EVER. We waited for 45 minutes in the rain.  IN THE RAIN, but I will gladly wait again to get another fix of their sinfully delicious soul food.

So my workplace placed us in teams and challenged us to a weight loss challenge.. a "Biggest Loser" or sorts. Before the challenge started, I managed to get one more wonderful delicious brunch in. Being that I LOOOOOOVE Cajun food, we made a trip up to the city to go eat at Brenda's Soul Kitchen. (Keep in mind, this place is in a shady place.... The Tenderloin... and you'll get taunted at as you wait outside for an hour for your table... We've had more than one hobo walk by and go "Man, who would spend 15 bucks on breakfast! You're nuts!" Seriously? I'd spend 15 bucks on my breakfast... especially from Brenda's! The cafe is a tiny little place; you bump shoulders with everyone around you and you better get there right when they open or an hour before they close at 3PM so that you don't have to wait eons for food. Oh yeah... and out of towners, go on Sunday or have a Handicapped placard cause those meters are sharks!! We finally settled in and Sam ordered the Andouille Sausage Omelette with a biscuit. I LOVE their biscuits. Flakey... light, buttery, oh so delicious!! It came topped with a smokey cajun-y salsa. Yum! I ordered their special for that day: Bananas Foster French Toast. OMG it was French Toast heaven... Delicious and completely out of this world... The bananas were tender, well balanced with a hint of rum, and had a wonderful carmelization to them. Being a Southern cafe, Brenda's also served biegnets. OMG... Biegnets.... Strangely, I hate doughnuts but LOVE biegnets. Something about the chewiness of them just totally appeal to me. Brenda's offers plain, Ghiradelli chocolate filled, cinnamon sugar and apple filled, and spicy Creole Crawfish and Cheddar filled. For those who can't decide, they also make a biegnet flight.. You get one of each!

Came here for breakfast a few times. I came alone, so I never had to wait and just sat at the bar near the entrance. They're quick to serve, and the second time I actually had four separate waitresses looking after me (and it was a full house). The French toast with butter pecan was simply amazing, and the sausage links I had with it were similarly fascinating. The second time, I had some sort of bacon cheese tomato-relish open faced sandwich. It too was quite tasty, though not as good as the French toast. I only wish they opened earlier, so I could drop by before work!

The place is usually packed. The wait staff is nice but tries to rush you out  so they can seat more people. We waited almost 2 hours. Eggs Benedict (2 stars), it was just okay. Sweet Potato Pancakes (3 stars) sweet and good. Andouille Sausage Omelet (3 stars) good and spicy. Beignet Sampler, the only one i Liked was the crawfish. (4 for the crawfish, 2 for the rest) Watermelon Tea (4 stars) pretty good leaving you wanting more. 3 stars for the food alone. 4 for the drink.

The first time I tried to get into Brenda's, we waited twenty minutes and no dice- there was no way we would have been able to wait even longer and still make it back to work on time.  So we sadly walked away from the storefront and hoped that the next time we stopped by, the line wouldn't be as long.  Luckily, the second time we came by, it was still early so there were tables available without a wait. I decided to go with the classic fried oyster po'boy with fries, while my sister got the Hangtown Fry off the specials board, my brother got the andouille and cheddar scramble, and my dad the grillades and grits.  Personally, I LOVED the po'boy- the oysters were tender on the inside, crisp on the outside, while the remoulade spread was thick and tangy on the fresh French roll.  The fries were delicious and overall, it was a solid 5 star sandwich.  Unfortunately, I can't say that the other dishes were as successful. My sister's Hangtown Fry was probably next best- of course, it may have helped that there were fried oysters in this dish as well.  Tasty, with lots of delicious potato hash (more like home fries) as well, this was a 4 star dish.  As for my brother's omelet, it wasn't quite as great as we were all hoping it would be, considering its got all our favorite breakfast ingredients.  He thought that the omelet wasn't well-seasoned and the andouille not as tasty, while the sauce piquant tasted like plain salsa.  Again, good home fries, but this was more of a 3 star dish.  Both of these came with a biscuit- they were both slightly burned on top and not as light and flake-y as we expected.  What really made the biscuit was the delicious homemade jam- we must have eaten half the jam in the small pot. My dad's dish was our least favorite- the beef cutlets were okay, but not anything special, while the "spicy Creole gravy" was too salty and not spicy at all.  Maybe it would have been perfect over the grits, but we asked for our grits on the side, which probably was a mistake on our part.  We didn't particularly like the grits, which congealed to a fairly solid mass once it cooled a little.  This was more of a 2 star dish. We also tried the plain beignets- delicious, delicious, delicious.  Fresh out of the fryer, they were pretty hot, but boy were they 5 star delicious.  We also tried the sweet watermelon house tea, which was too pulp-y and tasted too strongly of mint for my taste.  Our waitress also didn't offer me a refill, despite the fact that I had finished it about 3/4 of the way through our meal. The place is super-packed so either go early, alone or in pairs- you're going to have to wait a while if you're in a group of three or four, since there's only two 4-tops.  Don't go if you're hoping to get a private, quiet meal since you're just about sitting on top of each other in there.  The bathroom is through the kitchen, so you can a close view of what's cooking.  I'd definitely be back to eat more of the po'boys and beignets- I can't wait to try the other three types.

I just moved to the area and was surfing Yelp when I came across the reviews for Brenda's.  I was excited.  Since I work weekdays, I decided to be brave and go on Sunday (knowing there would be a long wait).  We got there around 2 on Sunday, and the wait was about 45 minutes.   As soon as we were seated, I started glancing around at other people's food.  I looked divine.  My husband and I ordered a flight of beignets, the blueberry cream-cheese french toast, a biscuit and watermellon iced tea.   I was really thirsty, and the tea was fantastic.  I gulped it down.  Then panic hit.  My glass wasn 2/3 empty and I didn't want to pay for another iced tea.  I sadly put my glass down, saving the last 1/3 for my meal.  I was surprised when a waitress appeared out of nowhere and refilled my glass - for free.  I expect refills on sodas.  I don't expect them on things that are obviously made with real fruit.  I was really pleasantly surprised.   The beignets arrived next.  My husband briefly lived in New Orleans, and was a little disappointed (the plain one was too heavy, and the non-plain ones were just not beignets).  Since I hadn't actually ever had a beignet before, I had no basis for comparison.  I loved the crawfish one.  I loved the first bite of the chocolate one (but it was actually too sweet after that).  I liked the plain one.  I wasn't fond of the apple one (the filling was a little dry and it was too sweet).   The biscuit with the homemade jam was lovely.  It was a little hard to eat because of the crumbly warm homemade goodness.   But other than being slightly too crumbly, it was perfect. I should have ordered something savory - because by the time I tackled my 1/2 of the french toast, I had eaten too much sweet stuff already.  I think the french toast was good.  The blueberry topping was really good and the unsweetened real whipped cream was nice (I was expecting it to be sweetened and was pleasantly surprised).  It offset the sweet taste of everything else.  I hadn't eaten it last I probably would be more in love with it.  It didn't stand out for me.   Summary: Brenda's was worth the 45 minute wait.  Brenda's is definately a restaurant I will add to my occasional line-up, but I probably won't stand in line there every weekend.  And when I have PMS it isn't going to be the one restaurant that I absolutely have to go to or I will die...

Not a big fan of soul food but I really enjoyed their shrimp and grits. Their portions are huge and filling, and sadly, I could never finish the entire dish, it's way too rich for me. Their beignets are pretty good, and they have about 4 different varieties of beignets so try their assorted plate. Parking is a pain in the butt, especially if you're going to come during a weekday. Metered parking all around, unless you decide to come on a weekend, then parking is free. Oh yes, I almost forgot to mention, there is always a line at Brenda's.

All the beignets are delicious, but the crawfish really lights my fire. The biscuits are buttery and flaky. Perfect with (more) butter and jam. The grits are also buttery and decadent... can never finish the whole pot. The portions here are plentiful so no matter how hungry you are when you wake up, save it for Brenda. She'll fill you up.

Brenda's Beignets are da Bomb! Aaaaaand, that's all we had. As much as I wanted to try this place, we were already lagging and just didn't have time to wait for a table. The line for Saturday brunch was out of control (granted, it was already 11:30). Quick solution: order a Flight of Four TO GO! I was half-tempted to order the Oyster Po'Boy too, but I figured I'd save it for when I actually sit-down and eat there. Instead we just walked a block over and up to Little Saigon and grabbed some Banh Mi (more on that later). The beignets were ready when we got back. We left behind the crazies waiting for a table and strolled over to a Civic Center park bench. Four absolutely scrumptious doughy puffs filled with either Crawfish, Chococlate, Apple & Cinnamon, or um, air. My favorite was the Crawfish. So, so good. Alice was digging the chocolate. I think she's found herself a new unhealthy comfort food. I most certainly fiend for those Crawfish Beignets. If only they didn't make my love handles grow.. This review is a work-in-progress, cuz I'm totally going back for more Crawfish Beignets and the Oyster Po'Boy. I clearly have no self-control when it comes to good food.

My friend Raechelle has been dying to try this place after I told her about it. Even though my last experience wasn't so great, I always give the place the benefit of the doubt and come back to give it a second chance. So off we went back to Brenda's for lunch last week. I'm so glad I came back. For some reason, the Crawfish Beignets tasted so much better. Not too salty or spicy like the last time. Maybe they worked out some kinks in the ingredients? I dunno. But they were quite delicious. We opted for the Beignet Flight, which had one of each. After trying all the cute pillows of goodness, the Crawfish Beignet was still my fave. For our mains, I ordered the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette and Raech enjoyed her Baked Brie Salad. Both were very tasty. To wash it all down, we each had a refreshing glass of Sweet Watermelon Tea, the house specialty. It was an interesting consistency. Not what I expected because it turned out to be a little thicker and had some sort of other ingredient added to it that I just coudn't figure out in addition to the pieces of watermelon and basil. Everything was great. I'm glad I came back a second time!

I don't really eat soul food since it's usually pretty heavy (oh boy, was it HEAVY) but uhm.. It was good here. But for you vegetarian/vegan types, not necessarily a place you want to be at, since most of the dishes are literally packed or scrambled with all sorts of meat.  There's like only 1 vegetarian/vegan friendly item on the menu (you will know, it says vegetarian). I must say that the crawfish beignet is SO GOOD. Just order one, they give you 3 that's like twice bigger than your fist (if you're a midget) I'm just trying to give you an idea here, that's still pretty big The wait ........... got there around 10:30am, and I can honestly say that the way was about 45 minutes (wasted a round of coins for parking, oh well) but was it worth the wait...? Well.. depends... I mean, the food was indeed good, but nothing quite stood out for me (except for the crawfish beignet).... So.. I'd come again for that only, by all means, the food WAS good, but you know. Oh, gf had croque monsieur here and she said it was bitchin'

My boyfriend and I woke up early enough to grab brunch... this NEVER happens. We finally got to experience what the hype of Brenda's French Soul Food was all about. Surprisingly, I can't say I enjoyed this place as much as the other 2000+ reviewers. We got there at 10:00am and wrote our name down on the chalkboard wall. We waited about 45 minutes until a table of two was cleared and we were seated. Both of us ordered the watermelon ice tea which was highly recommended. I like it because it was refreshing, but I have to say it was pretty watered down with a slight flavor of tea. It was nice that they gave us free refills.. but only once. The flight of beignet was the first item ordered. It consisted of 4 different beignets: Cinnomon apple, crawfish, plain/original, and Ghirardelli chocolate. We ate the crawfish first.. My first impression was that the beignet was on the dry side for each of them. Second, I expected this to  be fluffier but it had slightly too much dough which made it hard. We got a taste of each and got the rest to-go. My shrimp and grits were tasty. The spicy tomato-bacon gravy was good, but eventually got sweeter and sweeter as I ate. I felt there wasn't enough grits in my bowl and the majority of the plate was gooey (but delicious) cheese and gravy. I finished a little more than half of it and felt bloated. The boyfriend got 2 poached eggs, biscuit + fried chicken. He seemed to thoroughly enjoy his meal. I tried the eggs, but not really a fan of hollandaise sauce. I think this place is too busy for top-notch service. The waitress and waiters were kind, overall. Onto the next brunch place to try... whenever that is.

Nice minimal design, went at about 10:30 on a Saturday and only had to wait about 15 minutes. The Snooze blend coffee tasted like any other to me, but was nice and strong and complimented the hearty food well. The sample plate of the beignets was great...I would highly recommend the apple cinnamon if you like sweet, and the crawfish if you like savory..the plain and chocolate weren't as special. By the time my granola pancakes came, I was already full from the doughy goodness of the beignets, but the pancakes (topped with blackberries, pineapple, banana and oranges) were full of granola and absolutely huge portions... Come to this place with a full appetite!!

I had the flock of beignets. He had a sandwich. We both had watermelon iced tea. And it was awesome. I've been to New Orleans and the atmosphere really reminded me of my visit. My beignets were all delicious (the boyfriend liked the crawfish one the best, but it was a wee bit spicy for me--I liked the apple one more, especially after the addition of some heavenly preserves I found in a pot on the table). I will say, though, that they weren't very much like the ones that I had in New Orleans. This was slightly disappointing when they first arrived, but they were so good I stopped caring. HOWEVER. The boyfriend's sandwich was truly the best thing on our table. It was a work of ART. Turkey and ham on toasted grilled sourdough with heavenly cheesy bechamel sauce INSIDE THE SANDWICH and then gruyere cheese all over the top of it, broiled until just the right stage of melty-crispy. Amazing. I was also rather impressed to be able to look in and see the restaurant's namesake hard at work in the kitchen. I kind of expected her to be more of an "executive chef" and never actually be there.

Brenda, Brenda, Brenda. How you make me want to shout from rooftops and call/text/fax/e-mail/snail mail everyone I know to tell them how happy my tummy gets after eating at your restaurant! I rolled outta bed bright and early one Sunday morning to sneak into Brenda's before it's infamous long wait took hold, and I'm glad that it was totally worth it. Their flight of beignets couldn't have been a better way to start off the breakfast. Each one had it's own sweet twist, that almost had me doing the "Hey! Look over there!" bit in order to get the man friend to give up his share. Once we got to the main dishes, I was completely won over. Their Grillades & Grits (Beef cutlets braised in spicy Creole gravy served over grits) + 2 eggs was just what I was craving. My soft biscuit ended up rounding out the tasty meal as a personalized dessert, which included a swipe of their yummy berry jam. Not only is the food amazing, but the coffee and OJ are right on point as well. Service is friendly w/ down-to-earth servers that seemed to have been hired straight out of hipster Mission. The atmosphere of this small joint seems to give off a laid back vibe w/ a hint of hip. With prices this reasonable and food this good, I'll be back in a hearbeat! p.s. Make sure to come here w/ 4 or less ppl since seating is minimal.

We waited for almost two hours to get in on a Sunday. Why the hell would anyone in their right mind do that you ask? Call it determination. I've heard so much about Brenda's I was determined to eat there even if it left hypoglycemic as I waited in the long long line. Did Brenda's live up to all my wildest dreams? It was certainly really good! Okay, better than really good but I probably won't venture there again anytime soon. I had the Croques Monseur and it was delicious. We also shared an order of the Crawfish Beignets - YUMMY! Can't say I've ever had anything like it prior. We were all extremely quiet as we inhaled our food and tried to bring our blood sugar levels back to normal. The food and service were great but I did feel a little rushed as I looked out the window at the line down the block. I say give it a go but bring a snack for the line!

Beignet flight ($9) allows you to sample all four types. My favorite was the apple. But honestly all of them are very good. Sausage and cheddar omelette ($10) comes with grits and biscuits. The biscuits were amazing. The grits were also very good. Omelette was ok. Watermelon ice tea was pretty good. Place is a bit small. Staff was friendly and efficient.

We tried this place for Saturday brunch today. Wait wasn't too bad (15 minutes at 10:30) but we did have to share a table. Biggest complaint is that the space is extremely cramped. I know Brenda's hasn't been here long but it already desperately needs to expand. Fighting your way through the dining room and kitchen to use the bathroom can be quite an adventure. The food was very good though. We started with the cinammon apple beignets. They were very tasty (although not as exquisitely soft and doughy inside and not quite as fresh tasting as the beignets at Just for You). Next time I will have to try the crawfish beignets. I would've tried them this time but I was dining with my wife who is allergic and didn't want to rub it in her nose. I'll have to save that for sometime when I'm dining with one of my many mistresses. I then had the croque monsieur, which was excellent. The ham and sourdough were both really tasty, but the gruyere really made the dish. I had cole slaw on the side which was fresh and crisp and not drowned in mayonnaise. My wife had the egg and bacon tartine. It was good but not as awesome as the croque monsieur. The bacon-tomato relish was nice though. Potatoes were a bit uninspired, though certainly not bad by any means. The coffee was also excellent (nice and strong, not doused with that rat-poison-tasting chicory they ruin their coffee with at Just for You), as was the watermelon sweet tea (although the latter was a little long on watermelon and short on tea, but delicious nonetheless). All in all, a great meal despite the cramped quarters. Prices were reasonable (brunch for two was under $35). Plenty of enticing options on the menu, and lots of yummy sounding specials, so no doubt we (read: one of my numerous lady companions and I) will visit Brenda's again soon.

Go somewhere else. PLEASE. The line is already an hour long, and I still happily run to wait in it. The crawfish beignets are just incredible. I didn't know food could taste like that, and I count myself a foodie. Get the Grillades and Grits. Get the Poboy. Just get everything on the menu. I'm kind of speechless when it comes to Brenda's food because it's just so $%*&! good! So I won't write anything else. I'm just going to drool on myself for a while as I think about it...

It's been 6 months since I have patroned this establishment and after 500 Yelp reviews, business is more than booming on sunny Sunday. The good news is that the beignets were supremely better than the ones I ate in New Orleans' Cafe Du Monde and their biscuits (despite probably a pound of butter) are still the perfect texture. Unfortunately the grits were too oily and the eggs with corn maque choux were too heavy. I would be surprised if they don't got though a ton of grease a week. Also the sweet watermelon tea wasn't at peak flavor at the end of day, I think they need to create 2 batches a day if they want to keep quality high. In summary, a charmer for the fried goodness but if you are watching your waistline even a 2 mile stroll won't put a dent in the calorie intake.

Yelp has over 1000 reviews with the majority of reviewers saying something about the beignet flight. I ordered it and it was tasty, yes. But I think it would have been perfect if I had just gotten an order of the crawfish beignets. Awesome all around. Oh, and the fried catfish eggs benedict was also to-die-for. So . . . how good was Brenda's? So good, in fact, that I returned a mere two and a half hours later for lunch. The waitstaff thought I was insane. For lunch, I got the shrimp and grits. A shallow bowl with grits on the bottom, some sort of stew/sauce floated on top, at least 8 huge tail-on shrimp, and lots and lots of melted cheese. So, so good.

This morning I woke up excited. Today was the first time I would get to try Brenda's French Soul Food. Anticipation had been building for months, maybe even a year. I already started drafting my review in my head, before even getting out of bed. It would basically be a love letter to Brenda herself, going on and on about how much I adored her and her delectable food. Umm, I really hope I'm not the only one who does this... So, we arrived and were seated relatively fast. Our drink requests were taken by one very sweet waitress and the food order was taken by another not so sweet waitress. We decided on two of the specials:  the hangtown fry and shrimp and grits. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the crawfish beignets, so we ordered those as well. The beignets came out and while they were tasty, I felt they were a bit overdone. Not light and crispy, but chewy and tough. The filling was nice. We waited for what seemed like a while for our entrees, based on how quickly others around us were served. That was okay though because I knew heaven awaited. Or so I thought. Let me just break it down like this: The grits were watery and somewhat flavorless. My bowl was essentially a puddle of grease with shrimp on top. I've had cheesy grits before, but usually the cheese is blended in at some point so there's some type of semblance. Cheddar probably isn't the best choice for putting on top of this dish. I believe I ate less than half and that is unusual for a plate cleaner/licker as myself. I was sad to learn that my boyfriend basically choked down his scramble in an effort to avoid tasting it. Maybe we're missing something? Perhaps it's us Brenda, not you. OR maybe a place offering this kind of food is a rarity, which would explain the hype.   I'll close with the age old adage..."I really wanted to like this place."

Came here again with my coworkers for the Wednesday brunch! No lines which I love. The place is remodeled, giving it a more modern feel, but the food is still to die for. I was very happy after the meal, regret happened 20 minutes later after I realized how much I inhaled. Will definitely come here again and brings friends!

My new favorite breakfast food is crawfish beignet.  The best breakfast food ever invented.  Ever, ever, ever.  Just imagining that fluffy fried pastry pillow stuffed with zesty crawfish and cheese on the inside and powdered with Cajun spices on the outside is making my salivary glands explode.  *Homer drool-gargle* You have to understand that I am not a breakfast-sweets person.  Pancakes coated in syrup?  Donuts drenched in icing?  Oatmeal drowned in brown sugar?  GROSS.  Brenda's French Soul Food doesn't mind though.  That one savory crawfish beignet option (out of 4 total beignet types) completely won me over. The main dishes on the brunch menu have been filling and delicious too - grillades and grits if you're feeling especially carnivorous, bacon and egg tartine for a lovely contrast of textures, and the eggs benedict special was smothered in the most decadent Hollandaise sauce ever.  Plus, Brenda's is the first place I've truly enjoyed grits - the grits here are sooo creamy and buttery, they just slide down your throat.  Wash them down with their tasty Snooze blend coffee, which the wait staff is great at topping off! Hopefully helpful notes:  if you're trying to park, it's all metered parking nearby, but if you head west of Van Ness and past Franklin, the meters end, and it's only a short little hike back into the TL and the loving walls of Brenda's.  Be forewarned that personal space is probably going to be nonexistent here, but everyone and their mother has already told you that on this Yelp page, so GET OVER IT and be as considerate as possible.  If the beignets don't make you happy enough, you're a lost cause.  (Although the later you visit, the higher the dreaded probability of Brenda's running out of the crawfish beignets!  Gasp!!  The horror!!) So the best way to recap my feelings for Brenda's:  after the first brunch visit to Brenda's, we went back again the very next week.  I'm insisting on a 2-week break this time, for health reasons, but see you there soon enough!

First thing's first.  The biscuits are AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Beignet's are laso good. We ordered chocolate.  I wish they were a bit lighter, but best I've had so far here in San Francisco. Gumbo was okay.  You can pass on it. The egg and bacon tartine with its relish was very good.  Definitely give that a go.  The bread was so light...it made me also want to get a po' boy next time round And yes, enjoyed the watermelon tea. Cute place.  Small place. Worth your time.

I would love to award four stars, but we waited TWO HOURS before being seated. Granted, we came at peak time (noon) on a Sunday, so it was poor planning on our part. But even once we were seated, a good 45 minutes passed between ordering and the arrival of our meals. Fortunately, once our food did arrive, it was delicious (although by that point I would have settled for anything edible). I ordered the gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelette...Brenda's definitely doesn't skimp on the filling: it was stuffed with lots and lots of whole shrimp, sweet caramelized onions, and topped with a delish tomato-bacon sauce. My plate was also smothered with a mound of potato hash (good, but I prefer my potatoes on the crispier side) and a heavenly flaky biscuit. Enough to send any girl into an afternoon food coma. I also eyed the Beignet tasting platter - can't imagine tackling it solo but would be fun to share in a bigger group. The french toast also looked divine. If I come back, it will be at an off hour like 9:00am...no more waiting lists for me.

My parents were visiting SF for valentine's day and so we decided to take them out to one of the spectacular breakfast spots in the city. We first headed over to Dottie's, but the line was around the block and we were starving. Our friend Mario had recently suggested we try Brenda's and so we yelped it on our iphones and headed there straight away. We got there about 10am and put our name on the list. In the end we still waited about an hour, but it was valentine's day so I wasn't concerned. After we finally got seated, it was clear why we waited so long - the restaurant only had about 10 tables. As Dean Moriarty would say, the food was "It." Amazing, delicious, memorable. I don't remember what I had, but it was good - just kidding. I had the cream cheese french toast with blueberry compote and fresh whipped cream. I was in heaven. I am a BIG fan of maple syrup, but this french toast was too perfect to clutter with the overpowering sweetness of syrup. The bread was perfectly cooked, blueberries fresh and the whipped cream not too sweet. My gf had the tasty shrimp and Gruyere omelet, which I will probably be ordering next time. My father had the Hangtown fry - essentially a mix of oysters, hash and sausage. My mom had the sausage omelet. All the dishes were great.  Each dish was about $10. We also had the beignet flight, which allowed us to sample four different beignets. A crawfish one, an apple one, a chocolate one and a regular one. This flight was definitely worth it since it allowed us to try all sorts of different beignets. The only bad part of the meal was the coffee. Having visited New Orleans a couple times (most recently on our American road trip - see travel blogs) I am very familiar with Chicory coffee. It is sludgy, bitter and generally not good (some people still seem to like it). This was a dark spot (pun intended) in the meal, but wouldn't deter me from going back. I am a big fan of Dottie's, but when I want something a little more unique or southern inspired I will definitely stop by Brendas. You should too!

(3.5 stars) I've been meaning to try Brenda's for the looooongest time....and the food did not disappoint! I tried the Oyster P'Boy, really good! cooked perfectly and the cornmeal crust was really crunchy...for a Po' boy, it was at the higher end priced @ $9.50 --get the fries, the coleslaw was a bit of a miss. Also tried the burger with "tasso" which is a Cajun smoked ham, and it made the burger delicious!! It was extremely juicy and had a bit of spice --perfect! For dessert we had the  Beignet sampler--a real bargain because you get each flavor full-sized (4) for $8 as opposed to $5 for each. These however were a bit of a let down. I expected so much! But the puffy beignets turned out tasting more like soft bread. The fav. flavor out of the bunch however was the melted chocolate filled---a New Orleans style pain au chocolat! I'd go back for the food, but not for the beignets..I guess I'll have to plan a trip to Cafe du Monde for the real ones!

Only worth it on weekdays, and only if it's half-empty.  I can deal with the 30-45 minute wait, but it's so uncomfortably crowded inside that you can barely enjoy the delicious food.  I guarantee you that these guys are in violation of several fire codes, and I hope that they don't learn their lesson about this the hard way.  Beyond the danger factor, the fact that it's so crammed makes it far and away the most unpleasant atmosphere of any restaurant in town. That being said, damn were those some good grits.  I'm not a Southerner so I don't claim to be a grits expert, but these were easily the best I've ever had. Those fluffy pancakes are good, but the butter pecan syrup is AMAZING.  If I hadn't just stuffed myself on Thanksgiving yesterday, I probably would've just grabbed a spoon gobbled all of that gooey goodness down without even putting on the pancake. The beignets are also fantastic, and considering that they cost $5-6 apiece, the $8 flight of all four beignets is a great value. Beef cutlet grillades were a nice departure from usual brunch fare (I don't need to deal with the bullshit of eating here just to have bacon & eggs), but I'm not sure that I'd be in a rush to get them again.  I did love the sauce. And they make a mighty fine biscuit.

Oooh Brenda...I've eaten here a few times already but never thought to write a review until now. My husband and I enjoyed a rare day off together and headed to Brenda's for brunch. The wait wasn't too bad at 20 minutes tops. Mind you we showed up at 1pm instead of the popular early morning hours but there was still a small crowd gathered around the entrance when we arrived. We ordered two cups of coffee, the beignet flight, shrimp and grits, and the croque monsieur. The local chicory coffee was a jet-fuel eye opener. Strong but delicious. The crawfish beignet was our favorite among the sampler. It had just the right amount of heat to it. The apple beignet came in second. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp and grits but the croque monsieur was perfect, creamy on the inside and buttery and toasty on the outside. The fries were a little bland but it wasn't anything a little salt couldn't fix. Whenever I have the chance, I will stop by here to hoard my own order of crawfish beignets. Enough said!

We waited for about 45 minutes on a Saturday at around 11am, so had plenty of time to develop a game plan. I seriously spent almost all of that time reading reviews so we could decide what to get. After much discussion, we decided to get the Hangtown Fry (scramble with fried oysters, bacon and scallion), the fried chicken Eggs Benedict and the Beignet Flight. It was game time. And then it was game over. By the time we finished eating, I felt like I had consumed approximately 19 sticks of butter. The Eggs Benedict came with a bowl of grits with a pool of melted butter residing at the surface, and the biscuits were good for like 2 seconds until I couldn't hang with the butterness anymore. And let's talk about the beignets for a second. I might be a beignet snob because I've had them in New Orleans. But I thought the apple one tasted like a McDonalds apple pie, the chocolate one tasted like way too much melted Hershey's chocolate stuffed in a doughy mass, and finally, the crawfish beignet tasted like a Hot Pocket. I would say the Hangtown Fry was probably the best thing we ordered. But not sure I would come back for it.

My brother-in-law took us here (right after Thanksgiving) as he said we wouldn't be disappointed, but did warn us that there would be a wait... Yes, there was a wait but luckily it was only about 20 - 30 minutes and the place stays pretty packed. Food: I had the Shrimp & Goat Cheese Omelette (I asked for egg whites) which was very tasty and cooked well. My husband had the Grillades & Grits. He didn't care for the meat texture so he really didn't finish his food. My brother-in-law ordered the French Toast and that was good, not fabulous but decent (the Hyatt in the Financial District has an outstanding sourdough French Toast). We all agree that the cream biscuit is excellent. Service: I bit slow given how packed they. Price: Decent for downtown We will definitely come again and try the different types of beignets. Maybe after we try more of the menu items, the number of stars will increase. It is still a place that I would recommend to others.

From the South near New Orleans and this place is as close as it gets to the real thing.  Fantastic breakfast with a frequently changing specials.  The word has gotten out so if you want to beat the crowd get there by 9:30 (they open 8am).   I recommend the biegnets...very unique.  The crawfish is delicious. Word is the chef/owner is looking to train someone since she has gotten so busy.  I'm sure she'll do a good job with the training but try to get there before she hands over the pots and pans to a newbie!

If there's a fried oyster po' boy on the menu somewhere, I'm powerless.  This has led to many many disappointments in my life, because not every one can live up to the standard set by the many simple, perfect fried oyster po' boys I've consumed in New Orleans.   Brenda's is gooooood, even with the unorthodox but delicious chipotle remoulade.  More than made up for the decent but not as amazing fries on the side. I'm also in love with their crawfish beignets, an order of which could be a full meal.  All that rich, creamy spicy crawfish filling in a puffy savory donut casing.    Great biscuits, tender & a little flaky with homemade jam.   Refills on refreshing watermelon iced tea.  Some misses, like the mushy sweet potato hash next to a succulent marinated porkchop, but that was still good, just more like sweet potato mash.  I'm leaving a star open for when I can finally tear myself away from the oyster sandwich long enough to order something else.

Mmmmm the crawfish beignet was amazing, along with everything else we tried.  The wait wasn't too bad at about 10:30 on a Saturday either. I've als heard Brenda's is expanding into the laundromat next door so hopefully the space will be a little bigger and the wait will be a little shorter soon!

If you aint knowin about Brenda's you better get to knowin, this place is delish!  Only taking off a star because of the looong wait, but hey it's not their fault they're popular, or maybe it is. Chicken, sausage, and okra gumbo - amazing Shrimp, cheese & grits - incredible All beignets - mmm, beignets. French toast - great! But you should probably be a little more adventurous to make the long line worth it. Watermelon tea - what more could a po' boy ask for? Expect to wait at least 30-90 minutes for Sunday brunch, meet some interesting characters while waiting in line, and leave ready for an ecstasy-induced nap (of the natural kind).

Tiny place located near the heart of the Tenderloin, but it's packed of people with a crowd waiting outside when it comes to lunch time. That's how Brenda's first captured my attention, and I finally had a chance to stop by and try it out. It was a good experience and I will give it somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars rating. Melon tea was refreshing and I loved it not overly sweetened. I also had a 1/2 and 1/2 po' boy, half fried oysters and half shrimp gumbos. That was a good sandwich (though it got messy 'cause stuff kept falling out from the sandwich. Side coleslaw was okay - I think  the taste of jalapeno peppers was missing. Service was quick and prompt. However, the place is too small and it can make you feel uncomfortable at times. Other than that, I think I will go back and try out other stuff on the menu.

After years of walking by the brunch lines outside and not wanting to wait, went for dinner on a Wednesday, early enough to avoid the wait.  It would be worth the wait, but not on this night, too windy and cold. So everything was great.  You don't need to know anything else, everything was great.  Just in case, I will make some specific comments. Watermelon iced tea - nice and not too sweet.  I'd rather have brought some zin, but having already downed two drinks at a dive bar, this was fine. Oyster "flight."  The Casino seemed a bit tough, but the rest were perfect.  I liked the Tchopitoulas and the Orleans the best and would probably order just those next time. Fried chicken - Terrific, not just the chicken, but the sides too.  Good, juicy flavor and nice crust.  Coleslaw was excellent, watermelon pickles - yes.  Biscuit was great, probably should have butter since there was only jam with it, and nice crispy fries. Pork ribs - This was a special and if it's on, it's great.  Meaty and the meat isn't stuck on the bone so you don't look like Fred Flinstone when you're eating.  Mac and cheese and greens came with the ribs.  Now normally, I don't eat mac and cheese with gusto, but this was great.  Nice crust and rich gooey insides.  The greens were really fine, with big chunks of bacon. Desert - We got a desert but took it to go, fried sweet potato pie.  We were too full.  It was OK the next morning, but would be better hot. Ambience - nice if a bit noisy.  Service - attentive.  Price - great, under $60 before tip including the desert and a salad I didn't mention above.

Just lovely!  We had an earlish breakfast on a Tuesday morning, so there was no wait.  The service was terrific, the decor is simple but nice, and best of all the food was wonderful.  We had omelets & grits & biscuits, all of which were just tremendous.  The grits actually had some texture and were warm and buttery and didn't congeal into a scary  mass.  The biscuits were PERFECT and really didn't even need any butter.  I liked the shrimp & goat cheese omelet better than the andouille & cheddar one, but both were very good and had nice sauces.  We'll definitely be back and will send our friends.  Brenda's is a great addition to the neighborhood! Update:  I went back for breakfast a few months later and wasn't as impressed by Brenda's.  The server was inexperienced and had trouble keeping up.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing--the crawfish beignets sounded so good but in reality the shellfish was lost in the donut-like mass.  They beignets looked great:  they were covered with a dusting of some red spice mixture which was beautiful but, like most uncooked spices, didn't really taste good.  Next breakfast I think I'll stick to the eggs.

The best biscuits I have had in AGES! (The homemade peach jam on the biscuit tasted just like a miniature version of the most amazing peach pie ever!) The potato hash is perfect too. Oh, and I highly recommend the "Beignet Flight". It's a great way to experience the full beignet range. We also had great service:  friendly, warm, and welcoming.

This is my first ever Yelp review but I just have to give great reviews to Brenda's. I am a New Orleans transplant and I had just about given up on ever finding a good soul food meal at any restaurant in the Bay Area. They all miss the mark in some way. Just got back from Brenda's and I can't wait to go back! Today they have shrimp and grits as one of their specials. Get up and go right now! They close at 3:00 pm. This is the only restaurant where I will ever wait in line to be seated. The service was very friendly just as it usually is in New Orleans. The wait staff will actually chat with you if you so desire! We never felt rushed at all after we were seated. My friend loved the plain beignets he ordered but I was just too full to try them. Next time. Go to this place! If you are disappointed, I would be really surprised.

Yum yum. Most delicious biscuits ever. I liked the crawfish beignet. But though the main dishes at dotties at mama's was better. Lines on Sunday at 2pm was still 1hr+ long. And they no longer had the Upside down side pineapple pancakes. But still good... if you can handle the lines.

I've been on a bit of a mini California beignet seeking mission since I was introduced last year to these tasty fried dough balls (like a donut but without the hole in the middle).  I tasted the most amazing beignets at a spot in Boulder, Colorado and I followed that up with a disappointing experience in Santa Barbara where the beignet tasted like a style donut hole.   Just comparing the plain, traditional beignet, Brenda's stands a strong 2nd place of the three places I've tried.  Just because it isn't the best I've tried doesn't mean it isn't a solid beignet.  Warm, filling, and topped with a light layer of powdered sugar, this serves as a great brunch appetizer.   But what set Brenda's apart from the other beignet places I've been to is the Beignet Flight which is a sampling of 4 different kinds of beignets including chocolate filled, apple with cinnamon honey butter, and crawfish!  Why pick only one type when you can try the entire lineup?  I only ordered the Beignet Flight for my brunch and I was satisfied with eating just half of each of the beignets.  Everything was really good but major accolades go to the crawfish beignet which was unexpectedly amazing.  It was nice to have a savory beignet during the meal with cayenne Creole spices that weren't too overwhelmingly spicy. I came on a June summer weekend day and I didn't order the watermelon iced tea, what the heck was I thinking?  I'll get my head screwed on the right way the next time because everyone seemed to be raving about that.    And to top it off, we sat at the table next to Brenda's sister in law and had a pleasant conversation over the course of our brunch.

This place somehow brings out the klutz in me.  Today, I smeared syrup over my hands, my school books, and my hoodie.  Last time, I bit down on my fork so hard that a tooth felt sore for the rest of the day. But that's probably from the excitement every time they set down my plate.  The food here is really solid and this place has recently jumped into my top five list for breakfast places in the city.  The biscuit and jams (which change) are incredible.  The potato/sweet potato hashes and beignets (fried doughnut things that can be sugary or savory depending what you pick) are good as well.  The one thing that could be improved are the meats - the molasses chop wasn't as flavorful as I expected and the bacon was a bit soggy.  But the link sausage was great today - so these seem to be minor things for an otherwise perfect breakfast. Next week, I'm probably going to go again and manage to pour coffee all over myself.

If you are there to just try a beignet, Brenda's makes a solid "regular" beignet. I hear it's not as fluffy as they are in New Orleans, but I wouldn't know the difference because I have never been there. The chocolate beignet was not as good as I expected, spicy creole was pretty good but it was more creamy in the center than I would have expected. Coffee was like... dirty. Does that make sense? it was a gritty dirty cowboy strong coffee. I drink black coffee and needed to add milk and surgar. Not a bad thing, it just was. Things we enjoyed: home fries were pretty good. The biscuits were quite good. We sat at the counter and there was what looked like fresh strawberry compote, which was a very nice touch. The main event however we were a bit disappointed with. I ordered the Grillades and Grits and T ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine. Grillades and Grits: The sheer amount of food on the plate was overwhelming. 2 eggs, huge scoop of buttery grits, two pieces of pounded steak with what seemed like a spicy chili smothering the meat, and a giant biscuit. First - who eats this much? Second, I wasn't sure what the center of the dish was - was it the meat? Because if it were, then I was sorely disappointed. The grits were far better than I had anticipated, although I was expecting a bit of cheddar on top. Eggs and Tartine: When the dish came, we were both a bit surprised as it didn't seem to accurately describe what we saw. BUT... then we looked it up and low and behold, it was in fact what it should have been. The relish that topped the tartine had a hint of spiciness but ultimately finished with a sweetness that was common to relish. The bacon slices were nice and thick. Eggs were supposed to be scrambled per our order, but it was plain and dry, no fluff, sort of a sad excuse for an egg. The great saving grace of our experience (aside from the beignets) was the service. Some words that come to mind - respectfully casual, homey, the friendliness coming from all of the staff was really welcome and sort of unexpected. Sure, one always expects "good" service, but that "homey" service added a sweetness to it. Would we go again? Yeah, we are in agreement that for a cup of coffee and a beignet, absolutely... worth the trip. The french toast special from last weekend sounded LOVELY also... maybe we aimed too high?

OK, so this place needs another good review like I need a few more pounds on my thighs, but oh well, here I go anyway.  Brenda's was well worth the 1-hour wait we had today.  It was also worth it to finally meet my friend's man friend.   I had read about the long wait here, so I mistakenly had a little snack before going, since I can be even more of a raving bitch than I usually am when I'm hungry.  Then, to occupy our long wait, we decided to walk down to Hayes Valley and get a macaroon and some Blue Bottle coffee.  So, I was not as ravenous as I should have been. Now, onto the food.  The beignets with apples were fabulous.  I would love to try some of the other flavors in the future.  I got the eggs benedict with molasses ham.  Yummmmmm!  The hollandaise sauce had Brenda's special touch, with a hint of spiciness.  The biscuits rounded out the dish nicely.  The 2 bites of potatoes I had were yummy, but I barely touched them, since I was so damn full!  I took my leftovers with me to give to a homeless person, but would you believe the first person I offered these delicious leftovers said no???!!!  WTF?!  He didn't know what he was missing. 4 stars for Brenda, 5 stars for my friend's guy.

I went for breakfast today. Those cream biscuits are easily in the top three of my southern-food-loving life. Couldn't decide between potato hash or grits (sophie's choice?) so I got both. Almost forgot how much I love chickory coffee. The omelete was good. Walked out with a bag of crawfish beignets. One order produces three fried pillows of cheesy crawdaddy goodness. A bit rich for me, but glad for the taste. I'm thinking I need a long weekend in New Orleans to reacquaint myself with authentic creole cooking. Many thanks to Brendas for prompting this.

I don't understand the hype. We waited about an hour and a half to get in a party of three. If brunch is your thing though, you'll love Brenda's. They give you good sized decadent options. I tried one of the specials: pumpkin pancakes which smelled and tasted yummy. They were topped with cinnamon sugar and pecans. It also came with a vanilla cream cheese which didn't really strike my fancy but my BF's friend actually liked the way it tasted on his whole grain pancakes. I sampled some of my BF's pancakes which were okay they were definitely not something I'd go out of my way for. Service was minimal at best. Other tables had their drinks refilled several times but we only got one. If I were in the neighborhood, I'd definitely stop in, but otherwise, I'd go somewhere else. Not terrible but it didn't wow me completely. I heard that the seafood options here are really good. They don't take reservations and they don't split checks.  The watermelon sweet tea is pretty good. I don't recommend going here if you have a large party unless you feel like throwing down West Side Story style. I'd say four people max or you might get some evil looks.

OH MY G !!! Why have I waited so long for this place?! I mean we share the same name for crying out loud!! The watermelon ice tea is unbelieveably amazing !! Yelpers were not overexaggerating about this drink! We ordered the crawfish bignet ( comes in three ) and it was mindblowing! Along with that we had a cup of gumbo, two sides of biscuits, and the poboy sandwich with French fries. The poboy sandwich is similar to a sloppy sandwich but it was deelicious !!! The servers were fast and attentive to all the customers. Oh yeah, I'm not bragging, but the wait was only 10 minutes.

What I consider comfort food, some people consider: eh.  What I call extravagant, some people call comfort food.  For instance, I love biscuits and gravy.  I can't do bread.  I can't wait for things to rise, then knead it then bake it?   Today, I wanted something comforting, something fried.  Upon the suggestion of my co-worker, we came here.  I zeroed in on the fried oyster po'boy with fries.  Man the biscuit looked good.  And even the grits looked good.  I should have ordered a side of biscuits.  Even one biscuit.  I want butter.  Now.  I want something carb-ful and fattening and smothered in butter.   The oyster po-boy was good.  I don't like hard rolls.  I don't like the way it hurts my mouth.  I have a fragile lotus blossom mouth.  The oysters were plump and full bellied.  But there was only 4 or 5 oysters.  For $10.  Do you know what I can buy for $10 in the tenderloin?  I added a bunch of hot sauce.   I still want something comforting.  I'm searching for my comfort food.  I need something to make me feel better!  I don't like feeling like I'm drowning!

1 hour bart ride, 1.5 hours wait and 30 more minutes for the food to arrive = finally getting to try Brenda's. I really wanted to try this place since it was one of Yelp's top restaurants in SF. Plus I love brunch! My friend and I shared the Eggs Benedict with catfish, and the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette. Both came with either a choice of potatoes or grits. The omelette came with a biscuit which was really yummy. I love biscuits! We also got the Watermelon Iced-Tea which is really refreshing and even better because they give refills! We were so stuffed but we couldn't leave without getting beignets. We wanted to sample everything but was seriously way too full so we just got the plain beignets which came in an order of 3. They were so-so, not as soft and fluffy like Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. Overall delicious! It's a long wait every weekend but definitely worth a try!

Update from my last visit: Catfish Po'Boy.. A flight of Beignets. The 3 hour wait wasn't fun last time, but the food brought us back! At 7:45 am on a Sunday after a night of raging, no less. The watermelon ice tea is amazingly yummy and we were drinking this as soon as we sat down. The wait was just 15 minutes. They were open right on the dot at 8 am. Drinks and food ordered within minutes of sitting down. This time we ordered eggs benedict, a cup of gumbo, eggs and potatoes AND then of course, beignets! Everything blew us away again, so it wasn't a fluke last time. By 8:30 am, the place was filled and a crowd was waiting.. Can't wait to be back! --------------------------------------------------­----------------------- Parking was asinine since it was near Lunar New Year and there was a Tet parade on Larkin. After driving around for a good 45 minutes, we decided to park at a public parking building on Turk for $12. We proceeded to wait another hour or so and after 2.5 hours, we finally were seated. I highly recommend their Watermelon Iced Tea! YUMMY!!!! You can actually taste the FRESH watermelon in the iced tea.. It's not just flavored with a mix, but actual chunks of watermelon! Next we had a flight of beignets.. I loved the original! Next time I would just order that. You can't go wrong! Our main course was a po' boy sandwich that was on special that day. What I didn't realize was that no one ordered brunch at our table?! Soo I guess another visit is due! TIPS: Get there early!

I went here with two friends who live a few blocks away. The service was to the point but friendly, and the food came out in a timely fashion. Started with the flight of beignets, which was almost like dessert first. They were all great, but the obvious standout was the crawfish beignet. Great flavor, not too rich, and cooked perfectly. For my main course I had the Hangtown Fry special, which was moderately priced at $11. The dish was a fried oyster, bacon, and scallion egg scramble. It was a really unique combination of flavors, and they all complimented each other nicely. I had never had oysters with eggs, but I'm prone to do it again after this experience. You MUST try the house special watermelon sweet tea. It's delicious and not sickeningly sweet. Just right, and the perfect compliment to a great meal.

I have eaten breakfast at Brenda's 15 times per month for many months.  I guess that could make me a "regular".  Today I paid for my food, then left without even eating.   Here is why: My food, repeatedly, has come out of the kitchen in segments.  Eggs & Grits now, protein and/or biscuit 10 minutes later.  Eggs & grits are stone cold by the time all food arrives. I do not want to pay $13 for cold eggs & lukewarm grits.  The food is really great, though. Why not serve all parts of a single breakfast together?  It is strange to have a single breakfast delivered in parts. I will miss my daily breakfast a Brenda's.

I can see Brenda's doesn't need another review, but I thought I'd give a New Yorker's opinion. Arrived around 10am on a Friday, and wait was less than 5 minutes for a table of two. Ordered: crawfish beignets, hangtown fry, and sweet potato pancakes (special of the day). I got the watermelon iced tea, and my friend got coffee. Watermelon iced tea was a sort of murky brown-red color, but deliciously refreshing. You can actually taste bits of watermelon in the drink itself, and the tea flavor isn't overpowering, though it is rather sweet. If you don't finish it, you can ask for the rest to go. Wait was over half an hour because the wait staff apparently forgot about our table -- everyone around us was getting their food, and they'd arrived after us. So service was not the greatest, especially since our original waitress abandoned us and never apologized for forgetting our meal. But it gave my friend and me more time to catch up, so we didn't mind too much. Really liked the crawfish beignets. There is a lot of dough to this 'doughnut,' and the crawfish has no shells and isn't overly rich. It's a heavy dish though, with three servings that could easily be split among 3+ people. The hangtown fry my friend ordered was amazing. Huge omelet with fried oysters and bacon, which went perfectly with her crisp and buttery biscuit. Also loved the grits -- very flavorful and savory. My sweet potato pancakes made me gasp upon sight. Reminded me a little of Bongo Room in Chicago, but there were two HUGE pancakes slathered in syrup/pecan/brown sugar goodness. Hardly finished this one, but I loved that I could see actual sweet potato shavings in the pancake itself. Loved this place and will be back, though service could use improvement...especially since the place wasn't that busy when we came.

Love everything about this place except for the neighborhood. Atmosphere is a casual French bistro type. Service is friendly and intuitive. Every part of our meal was fantastic. Started with the watermelon tea and the flight of beignets (one plain, one apple, one with melted Ghirardelli chocolate and one savory that is filled with crawfish). The flight was a good way to try them all. We moved on to sharing a cup of the gumbo and it was really, really good. At that point we could have actually stopped eating but had already ordered more. I got the catfish po'boy from the specials and it was the best I ever had. They put their homemade pickles on the side and they were incredible. My boyfriend got an andouille sausage omelette with an awesome biscuit on the side. We rolled out of there, walked for the next few hours and ended up skipping dinner later because we were still so full. If you go there, I definitely recommend getting the gumbo, start with the crawfish beignet, order the catfish po'boy (which deserves a permanent spot on the menu) and finish with the chocolate beignet. This could be shared between two people.

This place is "Out of This World!" Every time I think of this place, I loudly wish I had the powers of Evie Garland from the 80s TV sitcom hit.  After taking one bite of Brenda's homemade biscuits, you can't help but want to "gleep" some right in front of you.  The thought of the buttery crispy outside and the heavenly perfectly baked inside is making me salivate uncontrollably as I write this review.  The beignets are amazing (you can get all 4 to sample).  I wish I could have touched my fingers to stop time and forever savor the hearty, juicy crawfish inside a cayenne pepper dusted beignet.  The chicken, sausage, and okra gumbo is also very good, but also very oily. If I could snap my fingers and teleport myself here, I would eat at Brenda's everyday.

This place is ridiculous.  Yes, its that good! The wait for a table can be insane on the weekends but  once you get to your table and get your beignets all that will be forgotten.   Try going really early or later or better yet on a weekday to avoid the crazy wait, or take something to read a folding chair, some paper bagged booze and make friends with the rest of the hungry souls patiently waiting with you.

Absolutely wonderful place.  Get there early Sunday morning or risk waiting in line for a LONG time, as the place is TINY. We had: 1. beignet flight 2. gumbo 3. bacon, ham, and oyster scramble 4. grits 5. biscuits with strawberry jam 6. watermellon iced tea - unusual, but very pleasant, and comes with unlimited refills And they were ALL good.  Reasonable prices, too!

=[ I brought some friends who were visiting town here to see what the hype was all about. Goodness the wait is LONG. So long, that we went to get siagon sandwich in the meantime! HAHAH Dang that sandwich was good! So after a 1.5+ wait, we finally got seated and order the famous Crawfish Beignet along with the catfish poboy, etc. Catfish poboy was MEHH. Tasted like a normal fried fish sandwich. Sauce wasn't memorable, and over didn't stand out in particular. As for the crawfish beignet - MEH times 2. Too much dough, too little filling, but it honestly didn't matter cause the filling wasn't tasty either. Sigh, the long wait was a waste.

I saw this place on the front page of Yelp and since I work closeby, I figured I should pay it a visit. I went there for brunch and ordered the crawfish beignets and bowl of the gumbo.  I had never had a savory beignet before and I'll tell ya.... I don't think they are for me.  Something about the fact that the pastry tastes exactly like a donut that didn't fit well with the savory filling. They were also coated heavily in some kind of red seasoning that I didn't really like either. But the gumbo, OH MY! was really awesome. Absolutely delicious and I could have eaten three more bowls. In fact it was so good, I came back a few days later during my lunch break at work and ordered the gumbo and a biscuit. YUM! The service is pretty good, they have good coffee, it's small and you'll probably have to wait, but I would say worth it.

Creative flavors and ideas for a fantastic brunch menu. I was impressed by the options from beginets and gumbo, to one of a kind scrambles/omelets. Most things come with homemade grits, or a biscuit and gravy. I ordered the bacon and egg tartine, it had the smooth sweet flavor of bacon topped with eggs on a baguette covered in melty swiss cheese and topped off with bacon, tomato, onion sort of salsa-looking medley. Delicious!!! The staff was really friendly and attentive, and answered questions while keeping the coffee flowin' TIPS: 1.) go in small parties- preferably a party of two; otherwise you'll wait over an hour 2.) don't miss it when they call your name; there are no take backs 3.) don't go hungry there is a long wait to get in (estimate 30mins outside and another 30mins for your food)

I finally got in.  Twice. I went on a Saturday around 10am.  We put our name on the sign up sheet, missed it when they called our name, and so we had to wait again. Dammit, it was worth it. I got the catfish eggs benedict with EXTRA HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.  And the cheese grits.  And the beignet flight.  Good god, it was tasty. I went back the next day.  I realized that it would be a smart move to order a ton of shit to go, and gorge myself on it when I got home. We got the banana French toast, the shrimp and grits, the poor boy, the hangton fry, the gumbo, another flight, and the catfish benedict. All of it was stellar.

I don't recommend their beignets - it's like fried bread dough. Once it cools they're better suited for playing squash with, but the flavors are nice - the chocolate beignet is probably just filled with semi-sweet chocolate chips and the crawfish one has a nice flavor of cayenne pepper cream sauce. What I DO recommend are their famous biscuits - "cream" biscuits, always served hot out of the oven, soft, flaky, buttery  served with real butter. Also, their sweet tea - which is sweetened with puree of watermelon and garnished with mint. Classy, subtle drink that soothes thirst and compliments your meal. Also, delicious grits (the best I've EVER had) and eggs although slow service. For you vegans... they serve a most perfect plate of vegan "josephine" a tofu version of the sloppy joe, in a most enticing tomato sauce with a side of the crispiest, most delicious shoe string fries. My favorite dish is their braised cutlet of beef served with grits, biscuits and choice of two eggs. I think that might be my favorite breakfast of all times, and as a loyal fan of chicken and waffles, I wasn't missing my chicken and waffles much. Also.. if it's on the menu try the sweet potato pancakes (perfectly fluffy, light, thick with a hint of spice, served with homemade brown sugar-butter-pecan caramel sauce) or the chicken etouffe (hot, spicy, chickneny). Or the catfish po'boys (crispy, creamy, toasty with perfect thousand island dressing on this awesome bun). The flavors are insane, and the texture astounding. It will blow your mind.

cute restaurant with a lot of personality. as everyone says, the crawfish beignets are truly amazing and REALLY filling. they're huge and super doughy. i barely touched my shrimp and grits even though that was amazing as well. heavy sauces but overall great flavor. it was my first time trying grits and i really enjoyed it! awesome service and affordable prices too!

Every time I have been here, it has been well worth the (long) wait. The po'boys are amazing! The staff is always so friendly and although running around like crazy, willing to stop and fill up my glass of watermelon sweet tea whenever it becomes low. And the pecan sauce?!

If you like fried, country/homestyle, comfort food then this is your place.  Otherwise go elsewhere. After driving by this place for years and always seeing a crowd outside waiting to get in, I finally tried this place out with a few coworkers.  All I saw was "Brenda's" on the outside so I really had no idea what food they offered.  Inside, the cafeteria type seating is a bit crowded but all the servers are nice. The food was surprisingly mostly all deep fried or buttery type of food that I personally try not to eat more than once a month.  The food was good overall but not what I expected.  We shared most of it.  I regretfully ordered what was basically a ham and cheese sandwich where the cheese was on the outside of the sandwich and melted.  I made a mistake on that one, haha.  I must say that the watermelon drink we ordered was OFF THE HOOK!  Gotta order that. Overall this place is ok, not worth the potential wait in my opinion.  Not for people on diets.  A bit over hyped.

Teeny, but cute place for good Saturday brunch.  The sausage omelette and red potato home fries were decent.  M loved, loved the gumbo but thought the biscuit a tad dry and dense.  Enjoyed the homemade whole grape jam.  The beignets smelled and looked good.  We'll be back after the superbuzz has run its course - geez, man.  I have to remember to try lunch. UPDATE:  Lunch was delicious.  We lucked out in getting the last available table.  Made the mistake of greedily ordering a bowl of gumbo with rice plus fries.  I can't leave well enough alone.  Oof.  Will be back again soon.

MMMM. Leaving Brenda's, the first thing I said to my fellow ladies who brunch, was "San Francisco needs more restaurants like this." Got there around 10:30 on Sunday morning, knowing there would be a wait for three, but we were seated by about 11:15 -- optimum brunch time! As we were entering the restaurant, I did glance at the list though, which had tripled in length since our arrival. The moral here? Drag your hungover butt out early, or fuhgeddaboutit! Anyway, the interior of Brenda's is what I would call cozy or intimate (but just wait til you see the bathroom!), and the servers expertly seem to maneuver through the space like little acrobats. Everyone was friendly, we ordered shortly after being seated, and kudos on the authentic French Louisiana hickory coffee... almost as good as Cafe du Monde! My special was the peach cobbler pancakes with vanilla creme fraiche, and it was a warm sweet delight. My dinettes had the praline caramel French toast and  the other a simple eggs-meat-toast combo, both of which were exquisite. Oh, and so is the apple butter on the table! Great food, great service, great ambience... I'll be back, but I hope you won't. In fact, forget everything I've said, because I don't want to wait any longer than I have to. Next time I'm going back by myself for coffee and a chocolate beignet! PS: If you haven't gotten the drift, this place is just like Dottie's -- not a sit down and leisurely enjoy your brunch type joint -- know what you want BEFORE you sit down, or risk being stoned by the hungry zombies outside!

Just up the street from where I live (yes, I live in the TL) and SOOOOO yummy.  There IS always a pretty long wait, so be prepared to stand outside for a little bit (in case it's cold).  Also, not a good place to come with big groups as the dining area is the size of my bedroom - so I either have a extra large bedroom or they have a super tiny dining area.   I got a catfish Po-Boy which was really deliciously fried goodness.  The sauce they used was really tasty.  Their beignets are also to DIE for.  I've only had the crawfish ones, and they are SO SO flavorful.  Kinda heavy food, but really worth the calories and the long waits.   Love it!

Summary: 2 hour wait Gross condiments Unkind fat to food ratio Wow.  It is rare that I am let down so much by a place.  Just wow.  We picked this place based on Yelp's fanatical love for it.  D'oh.  We arrived at Brenda's at 10 maybe.  Stood in the cold streets for two and a half hours.  Thats like $5 in quarters for the meter, just for the wait.  There were only like 10 groups ahead of us but the place is the size of an 1988 Camry so the going is slow.  So around 12:30 we are called.   As soon as we sit down I notice there is no lid on the katsup which is kinda gross and the strawberry jam container is sealed shut.  Once I pry it open its empty and crusty, ugh, but whatev.  We order the beignet flight, a coffee, a hot tea, shrimp and grits special, and this oyster omelet thing.  The coffee was ok as was the tea.  We would have been happy with Splenda or even Sweet n Low instead of sugar as an option for sweetener.  Take the decaying condiments off the table and toss us some Splenda.  Then the beignets came.  They were big.  Original, Apple, Chocolate, and Crawfish.  They were ok.  The crawfish one was really good.  The rest were little more than Winchell's dough nuts in a new shape.  And these things are big.  I mean, a plate of four was a fine breakfast for the two of us.   Then comes the entrees.  Let me start with the shrimp and grits.  The flavors were great.  But the pool of fat sitting atop it ruined it.  There is rich and indulgent soul food then there is pouring half of every spoonful out as orange fat.  Like Taco Bell meat style fat.  It was disgusting.  I don't know what the cooks have against draining a bit of it off.  I am not kidding, EVERY SPOONFUL was half grits and half orange fat.  Even pouring that off my lips were oily my mouth was coated it was disgusting.  My wife got the oyster omelet thing.  Her grits had the same problem as mine.  The omelet's flavor was over powered by butter.   I could have stayed home, gotten a stick of butter and a teaspoon of sand and accomplished the same thing.   I left feeling like I had eaten a 10 pound bag of flour.  I was kind of nauseous for most of the day. It was bad.  I understand what this is supposed to be.  They are trying to be that super buttery, yummy, indulgent place that you gain 6 pounds just eating there.  Instead it was just gross.  Indulgent and an oil slick on top of your food are not the same thing.  The service was meh at best.  It wasn't worth the 2 hour wait.  It wasn't worth a 10 minute wait.

Still good after all of these years. My new good friend and I shared a small cup of gumbo with sticky/slimy okra, and a plate of 3 apple-cinnamon beignets. She ordered the Eggs Benedict with fried catfish, and I ordered the beef rillets with grits and poached eggs. Needless to say, way too much food, but we nibbled and chatted like perfect Southern ladies would on a late Sunday morning. I felt like we should have been wearing lace covered sun hats and white gloves while sipping on our Community coffee and sharing our plates. Damn that line, though. Waited an hour after getting there at 10:45am for a two-top. Ugh. Any other day and I would have hightailed it to another spot.

I definitely will be back again! This beats Dotties (first brunch place I tried as a new San Franciscan) hands down. My boyfriend and I waited about an hour or so on Sat but it was well worth the wait! I must admit, we almost caved to the temptation of going to the Taco bell next door because we were so hungry. But don't give in! Okay, one thing on the menu you definitely HAVE to try is the crawfish beignet which was "mmm mmm goood." I'd be happy just eating that for brunch. It had this creamy crawfish filling inside the soft beignet dough and was topped with some powdered spice on top. The watermelon iced tea was freakin' delicious and the free refills were icing on the cake. It is a MUST order. My boyfriend ordered the fried catfish eggs benedict and the unique combination was spectacular! The catfish seriously carried the dish. The muffin was decent and so was the hash. The hash side was pretty good and had some moisture to it because I think it was fried with a little bit of gravy. I will order another catfish dish the next time but first-timers should really get this! I ordered the banana french toast but it was pretty much left untouched while I mooched off my boyfriend's food. It was alright and the portions was humongous. I gave the leftovers to a homeless person because it's not even worth blowing my calories over.

Brenda's. Even though the wait took about 30 minutes in the shady SF district known as the Tenderloin, it was definitely worth it! At first I wasn't sure what French Soul Food meant, thinking that it was more French cuisine than what it turned out to be, which was pretty much Cajun food. Not that that's a bad thing! Even though they required our entire party to be there (one of them was late and running like a mad man there), they allowed us to sit anyway, giving him 5 minutes to get here. It was definitely more than 5 minutes by the time he arrived, so I am glad they were okay with it! So grateful! Especially because the venue is tiny! And probably couldn't even hold more than 40 people tops. I ordered the Fried Catfish Poboy that came with Cole Slaw. I am usually indifferent to cole slaw, but this one had me wanting more after I was done! The poboy itself was delicious, and had an amazing (and dripping!) spread to back it up! I also ordered for our party a flight of beignets (since I wanted to try all the flavors). They give you all four different flavors: Chocolate, Apple, Original, and Crawfish. The beignets were the highlight of the meal. Nice and crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. The fillings were delicious! I especially liked the crawfish and apple ones. I love this place and plan on going back the next time I'm up in the SF area!

I eat out, a lot.  Today was just another one of those days (well not really).  I went to Brenda's for a birthday celebration and I am glad the birthday boy decided on this location!  I had heard a bunch of good things about this spot and I was excited to try.  I couldn't decide on what to eat so I ordered a bunch of sides: Grits Pecan sweat potato Pancakes Mac & cheese Beignets - chocolate I am mos def coming back to try something else (I had my eye on the pull pork egg Benedict) Quick friendly service and affordable prices.

Absolutely delicious.  Apple beignet to start, followed by grillades and grits.  Man, oh man... what a huge meal!  The beignets were the size of my fist, and there were three of them for $5.  The grillades fell apart on contact, just like they should, and the delicious gravy they were covered in mixed awesomely with the thick, buttery grits.  Yum, yum!   The wait here is insane.  The counter is just as crowded as the 6 tiny tables, so I'd just take whatever comes first.  We put our name down on the list, walked all the way to Starbucks on Market St., had some coffee, slowly made our way back over to Brenda's and still waited another 45 minutes or so.  Definitely worth it the wait to try it... not sure how often I could do it, though.

If this is a po' boy, what was the shit I ate in New Orleans? This place is really, really good. Super authentic. I knew it was going to be good before I even sat down. The following is a list of indicators that a restaurant will be good: Small dining room Closes before 3 Menu with only a few items Efficient to-the-point staff Good coffee Brenda's meets all of the aforementioned criteria. There are only 8 tables in the whole place (not including the counter service along one wall). It's tiny, so the place fills up quickly. That would probably explain the wait so many people complained about here. I would definitely wait for this food. I love a restaurant with the confidence to close at 3. That says to me "we're so good we will make enough money by lunchtime". I love it. This hallmark can also be extended to a good deli and a good breakfast place. There's a business saying that goes "do one thing and do it well". This carries over to the restaurant world. Menus with more than 50 items make me nervous. Brenda's has a few items under appetizers, a few under breakfast, and a few more under lunch. They offer specials throughout the day, but the good items get "86'd" before the restaurant closes. Once they're out, they're out. TS: Too late for you. I'm also a fan of this philosophy. If a restaurant has to bend over backwards to please a customer because they're out of an item that's a sign that the restaurant is in trouble and you might want to run. Most people think servers need to be ridiculously accommodating in order for the restaurant to be good. I was a server for a long time. It didn't take me long to realize that most people weren't at the restaurant to see me; they were there for the food. As a result I learned that I only needed to be polite and bring the damn food. Brenda's service staff is efficient and doesn't say much. Check! Good coffee. Goes without saying. Brenda's has great chicory flavored coffee. It tastes just like it does in New Orleans. The only problem is we didn't get a refill. Booo! (This is also why I didn't give all 5 stars, but Brenda's is so close! As for the food: Amazing! Everything we ate and drank was incredible. I had a shrimp po' boy that was to die for! Nicely fried cornmeal and flour encrusted shrimp with a hint of Cajun spice smothered in sauce. I also had the sweet watermelon tea. It was incredibly refreshing and tasty. A must! My husband had the pecan butter french toast. So good! Needless to say there wasn't a scrap of food left when the server cleared our plates. I can't wait to go back to try everything else.

Brenda's. You are awesome! Best breakfast in the city! Do not be fooled by the surrounding area. This is a diamond in the rough. Best biscuits I have ever had at a restaurant. So flaky yet very light. I had the seafood fritatta last time I came out here and it was overwhelmingly delicious. Try the red beans with beef cutlets too if you have the chance. But the biscuits... oh man. Dock one star for the food always taking so long, but other than that, it's worth the wait! Keep it up!

I do not remember any of the names of the wonderful things I ate at this spot, however I know that they were simply to die for.  Word on the street was that this place USED to be cool and is now a hipster haven...not true in the least.  The crowd was a healthy mix of all walks of life.  And there will be a wait on the weekend, but I assure you, it is worth it! And for those of you who have to "venture into the seedy Tenderloin," you don't deserve to go. I mean really?!

This is a place that actually deserves the 'People love us on Yelp!' sticker that you see flaunted on seemingly every restaurant in SF. However, because of this, I highly recommend you do NOT attempt to eat here on a weekend with a party of more than 3 or 4. You will wait for at least an hour! Or more! It was my mistake and I should have known, so, be warned. Next time I might even come here solo because the food is that good AND you will get in real quick that way. That said, deliciousness prevails and after the long wait you will lick your plate clean with pride. I do loves my soul food. Also noteworthy- It is BYOB here. And I, being the brunch mixologist I recently discovered I am, added a shot of Jameson to the watermelon sweet tea, and it was pure, alcoholic magic.

First thing's first, plan to get lunch (yes, even on a weekday) at 11am or 2pm. You will thank me. Also plan to eat no other food before or after this meal. Second, order the shrimp and cheese grits. JUST DO IT. Don't make the same mistake I did and spend the lunch hour being swatted away stealing bites from your coworker's dish. My shrimp and goat cheese omelette was alright. Not the best I've ever had. And more importantly, it wasn't shrimp and cheese grits. And another thing, no matter what you order, if it doesn't come with a biscuit, GET A BISCUIT. Maybe get two. You'll cry little buttery tears of biscuit happiness. Don't waste room in your stomach for the beignets. They weren't that good. And that's valuable space that biscuits and shrimp and grits could be occupying. Also tried my friend's watermelon iced tea and yes it's quite tasty. Lastly, plan to hide your leftovers in a large purse or jacket, as you will not be willing to give them to needy homeless people. p.s. you have to squeeze between cooks and frying pans to get to the bathroom, so go before you get there!

More like 3 1/2 stars... I've come here a few times. The first time was the best time then... I don't know what happened. The crawfish beignets are always good so that's a must order. I'm more of a savory fan so I wouldn't waste time getting one of the sweet beignets. When they have it on the special menu I would order the deep fried pork belly on cheddar grits, but noticed that piece of pork belly would shrink in size every time I would come making it more of a plate of cheddar grits :(  My friend had ordered the fried chicken which she normally likes, but it came out pretty dry the last time we came. Service is so so.

Deserving of all its raving reviews and well worth the wait. Had the beignets flight / sampler. Crawfish one was super delicious, apple was yummy, chocolate was a little too rich for my taste, and saved the plain for later. The gumbo was fantastic - such wonderful flavor! Didnt think I could take any more food, but the eggs and bacon tartine with hash was sooo good, I couldn't pass on a few more bites. Definitely share or come with a monster apetite.  I'll have to come back and try more of the yummies on Brenda's menu!

Fried chicken and greens was delicious.

THE PROS AND CONS TO VISITING A RESTAURANT THAT HAS TONS OF GREAT REVIEWS ON YELP Let me capture your attention by listing the CONS first: You order almost everything on the menu (Since Yelpers are such descriptive and creative writers; they make everything on the menu sound orgasmically good) You cry when the check comes because you ordered almost everything on the menu. You realized that Yelpers weren't exaggerating when they said they had to wait till the cows came home for a table or bar seat. Now on with the PROS: You get to taste almost everything on the menu You were smart enough to bring The Mister so he could fork out the cash to pay for the bill (or at least I was.. THANKS HONEY) We had secretly scratched some of the names from the list off so we could get seated first!! hahaha.. just kidding.. but you know you thought of it too!! STANDOUTS Brenda-She is way cool and full of personality Brenda's Staff- Our waitress is soo nice and very attentive with the pitcher of watermelon ice tea! yum Beignets- Fried dough -need I say more- Hangtown fried oysters with bacon scramble-cooked to perfection Buttery grits- I don't usually eat grits but this one is stellar A bottle of Crystal Hot Sauce- You stole my heart with this one

This place has amazing food!  Like everyone says, the Shrimp and Grits are to die for (warm-creamy-gooey-yumminess) and the Crawfish Beignets are pretty dang tasty (seasoned to perfection with chunks of veggies and crawfish).  I liked all the beignets, but the Chocolate Beignets are the ultimate sweet treat at the end of the meal.   The downfall to the place is the long wait.  I hope they expand this place because I'm not so sure I'd want to go through the waiting game again. This is a great place for groups and dates since you'd get the chance to try everyone's food, but be prepared for limited space and long lines.

Where y'at?  Y'all butta drop your Zydeco and grab those rusty britches and git on down to Brenda's!  Lord a-mercy!  I luv me sum good ole' southern French New Orleans breakfast, how bout chew?!  This place is the place where you had planned to stop for a mess of butterbeans but you plum dissermembered wit jus a smell from Brenda's kitchen, mmmmm, mmmmm! (I can only keep that up for so long) This place really makes you feel like Mardi Gras because you will feel like the personification of Fat Tuesday (and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday...).  Due to my busy schedule, the wait was long for my dining partners who arrived early but decided to wait it out.  I ordered from my BART office but arrived just in time for coffee and a splash of moo juice.  It's tight quarters inside, but super cozy and the staff is friendly and warm like their coffee. The beignet sampler came with chocolate, apple, plain and crawfish! The crawfish was my favorite but the plain goes great dipped in coffee! The homemade granola pancakes were large, fluffy and like a scrumptious breaded parfait.  Next came the Creole Veggie omelet and the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese omelet... oh it was completely absolutely fabulous!  Every bite of the omelets and taters were ... perfect.  I even spooned some of the grits.  They were a bit too buttery for me but had a nice hint of corn.  Much better than the grits I had in Kentucky (yes, I actually used my vacation time to go there - don't ask.) The only other thing that stood out to me were the biscuits.  I love big fluffy biscuits... LOVE....  and bread is my most favorite food in the whole wide world and the one's they serve up with your meal are just wonderful.  Put some butter and homemade jam on it and... OmmmmmAHhhhOooH.. the angles begin to sing! Hot damn, if no one has toad yew fokes, there ain't no udder southern style breakfast fixin's betta than Brenda's and as long as the lord's awillin' and the creek don't rise (muni is on time, that is) yew shore should get sum!

Even though this place already has more than a thousand reviews, I still wanted to add my two cents. Brenda's is good, but not great.  The line was pretty ridiculously long, we just went on Martin Luther King Day and even though it was slightly drizzling, the wait was about an hour and a half. Everyone recommends the Beignet Flight which comes with four flavors so you can sample all of them (apple, chocolate, original and crawfish).  The original and crawfish were pretty good but not as AWESOME as everyone hyped it up to be. The apple tasted like a normal apple pie bite. I had the Andouille Omelette and honestly, I've had better omelettes.  It was just a regular omelette with sausage, mushroom, onion and cheese.  The biscuit and jam were good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Everyone says the biscuits are bigger than your fist, but I could've sworn mine was a regular sized biscuit... and I'm an asian girl with small hands. The concept of French Soul Food and the high ratings on Yelp are definitely attractive factors that make this place so popular, but personally, I don't think it deserves all the hype.

After reading so many great reviews from a few different sources, (including Yelp) my guy and I were anxious to try this place. I had read that the wait on weekends can be up to 2 hours, so I was hoping that on Presidents' Day it wouldn't be so bad. WRONG! We waited 1 hour and 45 minutes....After such a long wait, I was truly expecting to have one of the best brunches of my life. You know that show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on FN? Well, I thought this would be my own personal "best brunch I ever ate." Wrong again...Notice a trend here? A REALLY annoying aspect of waiting so long are the cheaters...The people I saw walk up, and put their names on the list...then get called before we did. WTF? This isn't the restaurants fault, it's the fault of entitled douche bags. Anyway...After reading the raves about the beignets, I felt like they were practically a right of passage. Keep in mind, I've only had beignets once before, and I'm thinking they just aren't my thing. I thought the crayfish beignet was kind of interesting, and they were all tasty...But, I didn't have the orgasmic food experience with them that so many other people seem to have had. I did enjoy my shrimp and goat cheese omelet. The onions in it were nicely caramelized, and the flavors worked really well together. The tomato relish on top was also delish. Unfortunately, the potatoes alongside it were a huge disappointment. They looked like they'd be very flavorful, but they were completely bland and tasteless. I left all but two bites of them on my plate. The biscuit was good, and once again, maybe I'm just not a biscuit person, but it wasn't as good as I expected. I haven't had a biscuit in at least a few years, so this had the potential to be an exciting event. The peach/cinnamon jam was AMAZING!!! I even asked if they sold it. (They don't yet, but will eventually.) The servers were nice, especially given how slammed they were. I don't think i could be that pleasant! If I had waited 20 minutes, my review might be  one star more. For as long as we waited though, it was a disappointment. I'm glad we came, since I've been waiting to eat here for awhile, and i would have continued to wonder about it. All in all, NOT WORTH THE WAIT. There are plenty of solid brunch spots where you don't have to wait as long. Honestly, waiting that long takes a little bit of the joy out of brunch for me.

I asked where I can go for brunch? The reply was, "Brenda's Pam!" I finally made it here.  I run in the morning partly to be ready for the big feast that I was about to partake.   There were 10 people waiting for a table when we got there.  Always a good sign to me.  The wait wasn't that bad.  People were getting in quickly.  The place was small and cozy, almost no elbow room.  Tables were small, you had to almost be finished with a plate so they can take that away and give you the rest of your orders. The watermelon tea was popular so we got that.  Eeehhh nothing really special with it.  My friend didn't even finish it and got coffee instead.   I got me the gumbo cup.  I was hesitant with the okra in it but I didn't taste it at all.  It was so "meaty", tasty and really savory.  It had that kick I like. We got the Beignet Flight, since we were undecided.  OMG!  This on it's own was a full meal.  I specially liked the savory and spicy crawfish followed by the chocolate - yummy! I don't really like grits but for some reason I ordered the shrimp and grits.  After a taste, I decide it wasn't a bad idea after all.   Really, it was the crawfish beignet that blew me away and everything else was 3.5 stars.

After visiting New Orleans, my partner and I had very high hopes for fulfilling our creole food needs in our home city. We were thoroughly disappointed with the flavorless food and hasty service. We ordered banana foster French toast, shrimp and grits, and flight of beignets. The French toast tasted bland and dry, no fluff of any kind. Homemade french toast would be much tastier. The beignet dough was thick and dry, nothing like cafe du monde's fresh hot fluffy goodness. The best part of our visit was the crawfish beighnet. It was flavorful and had all the right ingredients. Shrimp and grits also lacked flavor. Our experience was really disappointing especially given the hour long wait. We would not go back. And our search for good creole food in sf continues...

The restaurant opens for Dinner at 5PM, main suggestion...get there early and write your name on the chalkboard...you will not be seated until everyone is there so tell your perpetually tardy friends dinner is an hour earlier than actual...and they do not take reservations. Brenda's is located in the what can best be described as a very 'urban' neighborhood...liquor stores and "massage" parlors are as common as Starbucks.  It looks like they are planning on expanding, the current restaurant is a bit narrow, but cozy...albeit a loud cozy.  You are sitting almost elbow to elbow with your neighboring tables. Good place to meet new people, but for you Apple Engineers, I would not discuss the newest secret designs for the iPhone or iPad here. Service was great!!!  I really do mean this.  The servers were very attentive in making sure our cups were filled and that empty plates are removed.  So an A+ here. Since it was date night, my wife and I decided to give this place a try...actually she's been here before and she "suggested" that I should try it...so here we go with the food: Appetizers:  Crawfish Beignets    ($2.50 each)  Like I always say, you can't go wrong with deep fried bread.  These gems (large gems) were stuffed with a cheese/onion/crawfish mixture...one word..."AWESOME".  The beignets were dusted with a cayenne pepper mixture that only hinted at some heat.  One word of advice(warning); cut open the beignet and let it cool...otherwise you will get a scorched tongue. Entrees:   Shrimp & Grits ($13)  Good size plate of creamy grits topped with melted cheese and about half a dozen shrimps (not fresh).  There was also bacon and tomatoes...really good texture and flavor.  It was definitely filling, surprising what a little mashed up corn can do. Oyster Poboy ($10.75)  Good size sandwich, but the roll was a bit thick.  Like I said, you cannot go wrong with deep fried foods...the poboy was stuffed with about 4 large battered fried oysters with a nice a slightly spicy chipotle rémoulade.  I had the coleslaw on side instead of fries.  The slaw was slightly sweet and crunchy.  There was some watermelon pickles too that had a really interesting flavor.   1 Piece of BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken - Thigh) ($3.75)  really g ood fried chicken, but for 1 piece it was a bit pricey...I just had to try it.  The crust was a single seasoned flour dry dredging.  It was moist...moist and more moist.  I love the crunch crust (more like a seasoned skin then a crust).  Next time I want the 3 pieces instead of the single a la carte. Drink: Watermelon Tea ($2.25)  too sweet and cloudy for my taste.  I like my teas not so sweet or chewy.  There were too many bits floating around.  My wife really liked it and got a cup to bring some home too. Bathroom: there is a dedicate Women's room and a co-ed room....which makes sense with the usual long lines for the Women's room.  The co-ed room was only a single seater.  It was clean and well stocked, good lighting...must be for the women that use it.

The Watermelon Ice Tea is sub-par.  I prefer standard sweet tea. Beignet platter - very good Shrimp and grits - grits wasn't as thick as I expected (not good or not bad just different from what I was used to when I lived in Deep South.   Since I went there at 10:00am on weekday, I didn't have to wait.  But if I were to wait for one hour or two, I don't know if I would go back.

Ever since I heard about Brenda's when I moved here...I've always wanted to go but don't really live in the area to make it a convenient breakfast or anything. But finally this past week a friend had his going away party here, and I got a chance to finally check out this place. I know there's always a line, and that makes sense...it's so small. We had a group of 10 and we were allll over the restaurant so we could all fit in there. The watermelon iced tea is really incredible here, and I feel like I might need it everyday now that it's been introduced to my life. (I've heard  drugs have the same effect). I got the sloppy Josephine (sloppy joe but with ground turkey) and it was really delicious. I often don't like sloppy joe's unless I make them myself (Hellooo I'm from Stockton- we have a secret family recipe!) so this was a surprise. But I was really down with this meal! can't wait to go again!

OK, yes, I could have done without that long-ass wait but the flight of beignets made me quick to forgive. The chickory coffee was soo tasty, smooth and strong. I needed a healthy dose of cream to get it the color I usually drink it. The only thing is that I wasn't crazy about the Gulf shrimp and goat cheese scramble I ordered. For some reason it was pretty watery. I thought it might have just been because I ordered the shrimp or something but my friend's order of the andouille and cheddar omlette was also watery. And my dish wasn't as tasty as it sounded like it was going to be. Ah well, the biscuits were awesome. Just spread some butter on that with some jam and heaven! Also, order the flight of beignets. We had that as our "appetizer" and liked it better than our actual meal. However, my boyfriend did enjoy his hearty dish of granola pancakes with fruit. He couldn't even finish half of it it was so hearty. But I thought the service here was efficient and friendly despite one customer's complaint to the manager that the hostess was rude to her. I think it was just a case of the customer being difficult. But if you do find yourself with a long wait, maybe walk on down to City Hall and check out the architecture. It's a beautiful building.

My friends and I planned our Sunday Brunch at Brenda's.  We were looking forward to it for weeks.  Finally, the day arrived.  We got there at around 12:30, and didn't get seated until 2:00 pm.  It was an hour and a half wait, but well worth it once we started eating!! I had the shrimp & grits, which were to die for!!  The flavor was wonderful and the shrimp were cooked perfectly!  I also had a buscuit, which was heaven...pure heaven!  :)  We also tried the crawfish and chocolate beignets...delicious!!!  Another friend had the pecan-maple french toast, which looked so good, just like dessert!  We were all pleased with our food, beyond happy!  We totally forgot about the long wait (they don't take reservations), and after eating our food, would gladly wait an hour and a half to get in again! The good news is that it looks like they are expanding, which may cut down on some of the long waits.  I say they cannot expand fast enough!   Word travels fast in SF if the food is good, no matter where the location, or how long the wait.  The food has to speak for itself.  And at Brenda's, it did that and more! Not only that, but for 4 of us, with all the food we ordered, or bill came to $62, which included drinks as well.  Very nice for the amount of food you get, not to mention the top quality of the food! I am still dreaming about that shrimp & grits and cannot wait to go back again!! Shannon

Maybe I came on an off day...or maybe I wasn't feeling sweets that morning. For whatever reason for my funky mood, I didn't enjoy Brenda's like most of the folks did. We came on a weekday in the morning and was seated right away. This place is small--I can see how it can get crowded. My sister and her hubby came on a weekend and waited 45 minutes outside before they got a seat. The plan beignets were hot and fresh, but I just wasn't feeling it. The gumbo was perfectly spiced with their grits but the two eggs any way you like 'em was..ehhh. Maybe I should have ordered something else. I'm willing to give it another try however...this time I'll be more creative and order something fancier.

Seriously, what is all the hub bub with this place?? On a Saturday morning we waited 40 minutes on a sad Tenderloin/Civic Center strip to be seated at the counter.  The experience didn't get much better from there.  The restaurant is miniscule, and the servers and kitchen staff are clearly overwhelmed.  After waiting an eternity, it took equally as long to order and get our food.   Just before we passed out from hunger, they brought over our beignet flight which was good, our favorite beignet was the crawfish.  The only other compliment I have is for the coffee.  The breakfast plates were mediocre.  My friend, who was starving, took 5 bites of her omelette and left the rest.   Hub bub unworthy.

I was going to wait however long it took...unfortunately it took 75 minutes.   This is not why it gets only 3 stars.  I really really wanted to love this place. We had the beignet flight, meaning you get one of each kind.  The crawfish one was awesome, the others were good, except the chocolate which was a bit hershey-like.  Note we did eat all of them. Ordered the egg and bacon tartine w/tomato-bacon relish.  It was very good, the relish is what saves the dish...it is so yummy.  HOWEVER, my friend had the same thing and after eating like 3 bites there was hair in it.  Like 2 - 3 long hairs from the chef.  Advised the server, who apologized briefly and removed it, replacing it 5 minutes later.   I would have expected to have something done, like a bite of something else from the chef as an apology, or comping the beignets, or something....but nothing of the sort happened.  Even more strange, the table next ours got the beignet flight "compliments of the chef" for something.....I think they were the last table seated for the day. I want to go back to try something else, but considering it's popularity, the hair, and the service, not sure I will get the chance.

I'd been meaning to try this place out for a while now.  When a friend of mine woke me up this morning for some brunch, the opportunity to hit this place up was too good to pass up. As noted by many of the reviewers, this place is TINY, hence a rather long wait.  It got to the point that my innards began eating themselves and a double decker taco at the KFT next door began looking pretty tasty.  However, through some hurculean willpower, I was able to resist.  And believe me, it was worth the wait. Since all of the beignets sounded so good, we went with the flight.  It was honestly a party in my mouth.  And I'm not talking D-List celebrity party with Kathy Griffin and that slut Trishelle from the Real World Las Vegas.  I'm talking strictly George Clooney, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz A-Listers baby. The rest of our food was a blur of delicious goodness.  One thing I must point out was the biscuits.  Perfectly flaky on the outside and melt in your mouth deliciousness on the inside.  When we were done with our food, they had to roll us out of the restaurant.  I'm still kinda full from our meal there today, yet I can't stop thinking about the next time I'm hitting this place up.  Looks like I've got a new favorite brunch spot!

The food was great!  I am not a fan of corn bread or stuffing but I love Brenda's cornbread stuffing.  It was perfect and moist and full of flavor. I was not impressed by the watermelon tea.  It was actually kinda gross. Our wait was about 45 minutes.  Luckily it was a nice day and I didn't freeze to death standing outside.  The restaurant is tiny.  The back of my chair practically rested against the tall stool behind me, putting me uncomfortably close to a strangers behind.

YUM. Since Brenda's is only 6 or 7 blocks down from my apartment, I think one of us will have to go and put our name down next time or possibly get take out. The wait got a little painful toward the 90 minute mark. Anyway, I don't regret it. The Crawfish and Cayenne Beignets alone were to die for. They come 3 at a time so be careful. We could barely eat one each and still eat ANY of our meal. After the beignets I got some sort of open faced breakfast sandwich with a side of grits that tasting amazing - at the least the 1/3 of it that I could still get down! BF got the shrimp and grits which was a  massive bowl of buttery goodness. He also ate about 1/3. I would definitely save Brenda's for a treat - unless you're trying to quickly reach 400lbs.

I picked this place for 2 things: The beignets and the watermelon iced tea.  Both failed way below my expectation. The plain beignets came out dry and literally, plain.  They did not have the fluffiness I was craving, rather, it was just doughy and tasteless.  The watermelon tea was only OK.  It had a faint smell/taste of Chinese red bean soup, a fruity rawness to it, but nothing special. And the bathroom...  Oh my.  I had to risk getting burned by walking sideways with my arms held down to squeeze through the narrow kitchen just to wash my hands...  But that wouldn't have been an issue with me if the food was delicious.  My problem with this place was mainly the food.  The underwhelming eggs and grits, the very so-so flavors.  Won't go back, I don't think.

Came here on a weekday around 1pm, waited about 20 minutes, not bad at all because we were expecting the worst.  Ordered the hangtown, watermelon ice tea, and beignet flight.  The hangtown had lots of fried but juicy oysters in the scramble.  It was delicious.  The watermelon ice tea was extremely good and refreshing.  The beignet flight was good but between two people it was too much food to handle.  Overall, a great experience.   Pros: great hangtown and watermelon tea. Cons: it's really small so you always have to wait and you have to wait outside!

I've been here twice and tired out about 4 different things. I came back the second time just to make sure I didn't miss anything. One day I will hopefully figure out why everyone likes this place(the watermelon ice tea is good), but until then here is the scoop: 1. The beignets are not good. They are doughnuts, they are supposed to be soft, not hard like they are here. I didn't order a brick covered in sugar.  Go to Cafe Fanny in East Bay or Just For You Cafe in the city for real beignets. You will thank me. Really. 2. The grits are terrible. I actually had my frist grits here, and then went to Atlanta and had real shrimp and grits, huge difference. 1300 on Fillmore has actual good shrimp and grits; go there please. These are drowning in a pool of butter, I didn't know that much butter was legal in the state of California. 3. An hour+ long wait? Haaaillll no.

Would everyone PLEASE stop claiming to make the best beignets? Better yet, would you please stop calling your tasteless fried lumps of bread dough beignets?  The beauty of southern french cooking, and, in particular, the beignet, is in the heavy use of egg and butter in the cuisine. A beignet is supposed to be a fried pâte à choux. Where is the butter? Where is the egg? I feel like a broken beignet fan recording. I guess I just have to make them myself. Oh, bollacks. As for the OTHER creations here, the food is quite good, ESPECIALLY the biscuits!!! Fill up your belly with a side of eggs and bacon, biscuits, butter & jelly. Sometimes simple is best. This place is tiny and you will have to wait.

Did takeout for breakfast Sat morning, bit of a wait for takeout, but nice setup complete with environmentally friendly silverware. I had the Creole Veggie omlette, roasted potatoes (or you could get grits) and biscuit (or you can get toast)--Omlette was nicely cooked but not sure what made it "creole" other than creole seasoning sprinkled on the top of the omlette. Nice size. Potatoes were tasty, big chunks and good seasoning, home-style breakfast potatoes. Biscuit to die for, big, flaky, little bit of a crust on the top and sides, super soft on inside. Also comes with little tubs of peach and strawberry chunky jam (seems homemade) and butter. Hubby had Grillades and Grits--Beef cutlets braised in gravy, grits, 2 eggs and biscuits. Beef and eggs were overdone, but flavor pretty nice. He had asked for overeasy eggs and it was not runny one bit. Steak was tough.Same opinion on biscuits. Grits were also super good and creamy, he grew up eating grits so he knows some good ones and he gave huge thumbs up. Overall would go back and get grits, potatoes and biscuits...slightly pricey (about $23 total) for breakfast, but portions nice and the good parts surely make it worth it!

So apparently the trick to this place is get here before 9:30am on a Sunday and its no issue getting in.  I don't know - I've only been here once and we got there around that time and got the last table...  by the time we left, there were about 20 people waiting outside to get in.   The beignets were delicious...  I don't know if I'd suggest the flight unless there are at least 4 of you... as they are very large!  We just got the plain beignets and it was plenty for 3 of us to share.   For brunch, I got the eggs benedict.  Oh man - those biscuits!  So good...  and they even got grits right!  Someone in San Francisco knows how to make grits!  I shouldn't say that - I'm sure there are plenty of southern transplants in the bay area.   Anyway, this place is tiny.. so get there early and enjoy a cute little french soul food meal.

Update Feb. 2010 The Superbowlers win 2010 big time and then another le bon temp bon mot...Hooray...glad to hear that Brenda got an opportunity to expand her space to welome more of her fans...I guess this will help most during the Sunday stomach growling noises... 2009 Respect the Petite Brenda. If her place is crowded because she is not an industrialized corporate behemouth of a feed farm. BE PATIENT. This place is VERRRYYYY popular at lunch Monday - Friday and for the Sunday brunchers, but don't let that deter you. The kitchen is smaller than a walk-in closet and it appears as if Brenda is cooking with maybe two burners on the stove. I can appreciate that Brenda is down home Mama. She has white linen tablecloths for what..about seven tables multiply it by say two seated at a table (small tables in a small space)  that means space for about 14 customers?.... Try to figure out what you want to order before being seated and ask the waitperson what they recommend too. There is a sandwich board outside of Brenda's on Polk street listing her specials for the day. If it is late in the day the specials may be long gone and in someone else's tummy. If you can get there around 11:30 am on Wednesday, sometimes it is pleasantly N.O.L.A. stylin...like that slow and warm New Orleans drawl..."Le Bon Temps...bienvenue". Libby was helpful, and nice. Chocolate Beignets were Ghirardeli  rich, hot, heavy doughy and dusted powdery...Three Chocolate Beignets fill one up heavily. Pancakes, Eggs and Hash, (Watermelon Ice Tea, when the weather is warm and the sun is out). Hey Mardi Gras without the crazy alchoholic beady-bourbonites, Respect the Brenda's Soul. It may be small, but it is comforting if haters are not doing the SoCal rush...wanted it yesterday attitude. If you cannot respect the Petite Brenda, perhaps you want the KFC next door.

Ignore the other offerings in the beignet flight and possibly the rest of the menu - ask for a full order of crawfish beignets and be glad (and fatter) that you did, they're wonderful. i grew up + went to college in the south. mud bugs, spicy food and beer are an integral part of life. that, and subtle racism (which is why i be livin in sf :))

#42 on the Big Eat SF Fried-shrimp po'boy 3 stars for the suggested item. Grabbed it to go - easy enough to call in 15 min before (otherwise very busy to sit down). Was ok, a bit on the heavy side. Extra star - I'd rather go back for brunch there though! Been once, but the crowds scare me. With some planning I'll be back again =)

The only problem I have with Brenda's is that I ALWAYS end up ordering the wrong thing. And whomever I'm with orders the most delicious thing ever and I'm grumpy the rest of the day because I wanted the frittata instead of my lame omelet or whatever. But really, I love the food and now that I've tried a lot of the menu I'm pretty sure I know what to get. I just get so tempted to try the specials and then realize I should have just ordered what I wanted. I'm neurotic about ordering, sorry. The crawfish beignets are my fav but sometimes come out a tad too salty. All of the egg dishes are super duper and the biscuits with homemade marmalade are the really the main attraction here. The po'boy sandwiches kind of suck tbh. I think it might be the big mac sauce or the fact that the breakfast food is so darn good but the time I ordered that I wanted to cry. My friend had gotten the andouille and cheddar eggs which I loved and considered ordering ex post facto and giving my sandwich to a homeless person outside (i'm not that nice tho) The only other thing to watch out for is that they exclusively serve that chicory shit here. I still don't know if I'm comfortable accepting this as a substitute to real coffee and there should be an option for the tradition coffee bean sect of society. we do live in america right? I NEED OPTIONS. AND FREEDOM FRIES.

I just came here for brunch yesterday with my friend and I already want to go back! We ordered the Beignet Flight (one of every flavor) and my friend ordered the French Toast while I got the Fried Gulf Shrimp Po' Boy. Man oh man...it was so good! I'm actually craving it right now! The french roll that it comes on was toasted to perfection which added an extra nice crunch to go along with the fried shrimp, lettuce, tomatoes, and their delicious sauce. Must try! Well, acutally you can't go wrong with anything here. Make sure you order a glass of their refreshing watermelon iced tea to make your meal complete! Yumm!!

It sucks to update my review, I've experience better - at Brenda's about a year ago. I went back with a friend recently, quite unprepared for weekend brunch crowds on a non-holiday Monday around 11am. So ok, I was prepared to wait a bit, whatever. But what I was not prepared for was their new policy of trying to cram as many large parties into the two-tops or the counter seating at the expense of parties of two that had been waiting for more than an hour. We arrived right before 11 and were seated around 12:30. And then there was the food. The fried shrimp were gross. The breading was cold, not even flavorful, and the actual shrimp were overcooked. My breakfast-mate's tartine had one anemic piece of bacon and a HUGE portion of eggs that (and I'm trying to be as honest as possible here) looked like McEggs. Her side of potatoes were an unidentifiable shade of grey/brown and sort of gloopy. The worst, however, were my once-upon-a-time faves: the crawfish beignets. For the love of god. The pastry was both soggy and dried out in places and the filling was more paprika than anything else. I took two of the three home to my husband, who made the saddest face after biting into one. It was depressing to eat at Brenda's because I love everything about that place (well, except for the wait), but maybe the quality had to take a dive to accommodate so many tourists (who were eagerly clutching guidebooks bookmarked to Brenda's entry when we came). Thank god I didn't come for weekend brunch.

If I must be honest...this Naw'lins restaurant got a lot mo' hype than it shoulda. It's not bad food, but it's also not.... TO DIE FOR! (LAWL! Get it?! Because of Hurricane...oh...yea....sorry....too soon) Anyways! The setting here at  Brenda's French Soul Food is very nice. Cozy, warm, and it makes you just wanna spend a butt load of your money. When ordering beignets, you start to think "should I order plain, chocolate, apple, crayfish, or the sampler of each?" As many of you might have been thinking, a sampler of 4 different beignets sounds like a lot - which it is. But in the spirit of those who lost their lives in such a tragic event, I HAD to get my grub on! So I ordered the sampler (the Beignet Flight), the watermelon iced tea, and the grits. **Watermelon Iced Tea** It's watermelon juice/chunks, and iced tea. Not a big deal. End of story. **Grits** WOOO DOGGY! I've never had grits in my life and after hearing so many black people talk about it on the food network, I just HAD to see what the fuss was about. And boy oh boy, this shits GOOD MAH NI......nice friends! After eating those grits, I felt 40 times more black than I normally do! I just wanted to listen to some blues, hate on white folks, and complain to the government for not paying my reparations! Nevertheless, the grits were flavorful, smooth yet gritty (go figure), and they served as an amazing dip for the beignets. **Beignets** *Plain* Light, dense, and tasty. Like a fresh - but not so soft - donut, the plain beignet was primarily used as a dipping agent for my beignets. I guess you can consider them the "white girls" and my grits the "black men" of society. MUAHAHAHA! *Chocolate* Now... I'm no Swiss chocolatier, but the chocolate in this thing was overly bitter-sweet. I mean I get it, and I'm sure they were just sticking to the original recipe, but honestly, it wasn't sweet enough. I just felt like the bitter aspect began overwhelming the flavor and it started to feel like I wasn't even eating chocolate. *Apple* No sooner than my first bite, I started to make that "squinted eyes while looking into the air, trying to recall what this reminds you of" face. Sadly, I wasn't thinking about my first kiss nor was I recalling my case of jungle fever - instead, I was reminded of McDonald's Apple pies. The filling in the beignet felt cheap, a wee bit mushy, and overly seasoned. I just wish they let the apples take precedence instead of letting the brown cinnamon immigrate and overpopulate the beignet, causing an influx of poverty and crime into the.... ANYWAYS! *don't worry, I totally love Mexicans. I'm actually more pro-Latino than I am white. NO WORRIES, HOMES!   *Crayfish* Now THIS is what I'm talkin bout! YEAAA BUDDY! The seasoning and the creaminess of the filling was amazing. Spicy enough, sweet to an extent, and all was good in the land of my belly. Although, I honestly wish they added more filling. Oh wellz. I give Brenda's French Soul Food a 3.7 out of 5.

4/5 worth it. 1. get the flight, you know you want to. just keep eating. 2. you can skip the gumbo. 3. get the oyster bacon scallion egg with grits and biscuit. yeah. just keep eating. it is all good, worth the wait. butter your grits, that is just good form. come early or later, try to gauge the dining rush. will be back for sure in the very near future. to top it all off, super affordable. holler at that.

I'd waited about 4 months before deciding to go for the long wait preceding eating @ Brenda's. We waited for an hour (at noon on a Sunday - not too uncommon around SF) and got served quickly. The food was definitely tasty, and true to its 'French soul food' claim, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I'm not from the south and am therefore not exactly sure what crawfish and grits ought to taste like, so it's possible I'm not the best judge. Nonetheless, I don't think I'd go back unless someone I was with really *really* wanted to go. Why can't popular SF restaurants take the hint and get bigger joints!?

Honestly, our visit did not start off too well. We meant to grab some brunch but got there 2 minutes after the brunch menu ends and were not allowed to order off it. Got the mid day menu offered from 3-5pm instead. The only appealing item on the menu was the burger so 3 of us ordered the burger, then I ordered the hushpuppies and a cup of Gumbo. The burgers come w options to add cheese ($1) or an egg ($2). I suggest adding both!!! it makes it a pricey burger at over $13.50 but so delicious. The burgers are cooked well (all according to requested temperature). We got it medium and it was nicely pink and ultra juicy. The patty was well seasoned and the mayo was delicious - it tasted like a mix of relish, mayo with some Cajun seasoning. The egg ties it all together so well, made it quite messy to eat since the burgers were massive and juicy. but it is all good. Hushpuppies were pretty decent. Nice crusty corn bread balls with a spicy kick. Served with the same mayo that comes on the burger. Gumbo was ok. The rice stayed intact and was not mushy. Good fflavours but not the best thing there. Watermelon iced tea - very good and refreshing. Might be an acquired taste for some. Coffee - tangy and light. Service was ok. Food got served in less than 10 minutes after ordering. Servers were too much on top of anything or very approachable but efficient enough.

When I saw this place I thought it would be good, but it was better than that. They have some innovative items on their menu that are must trys- like the craw-fish beignets and watermelon sweet tea. We tried a few other things off the menu as well like the shrimp po boy - and everything was very tasty- but i just kept wanting more and more of the beignets! Of note this place doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait. We showed up on a friday afternoon at about 12:30 and waited about anhour to get seated. And given that its in the heart of the tenderloin - not exactly the streets you want to spend and hour hanging out on. That being said, it was the only con I could find in the place. This is a definite return to place. And in a city with so many delicious places to try I don't say that all too often.

Mmmm! This one one my favourite breakfast spots in my 'hood. I was actually having my knives sharped across the street from the Culinary School and started to look for something to eat. A few doors up was BRENDA'S. First time I had the french toasts w marscapone, strawberries, and walnuts. That was fantastic! The only thing that could have made it better was warm syrup but I've found that not many places in the Bay do this. Second time I had the egg and bacon open faced sandwich (can't remember what it's called right now) and that was really REALLY good. There was this bacon-tomato relish that just really sent it over the top. My gal pal had grits with her meal and the grits were really good too. I also really recommend their water melon tea. I think it's a sweet tea with watermelon puree in it. There's also basil in the tea - not mint. That tea was the highlight of my meals. It's a nice little walk from the Civic Center Plaza. I definitely plan to come back with friends.

Delicious!    I just went to Brenda's yesterday for brunch and it was well worth the 45 minute wait. Me and my bf ordered a cup of the gumbo (so tasty - a bit on the salty side, but I loved it).  We also had their crawfish beignets - which practically filled me up before I had my main entree.   You get three rather large beignets - they were a bit doughy for my taste buds, but I'm not a beignet expert by any means.    We also ordered the watermelon sweet honey tea which tasted exactly like regular iced tea (not sweetened) with a slight hint of watermelon and honey.   It was refreshing but just needed a little extra sugar for my palette). For an entree I ordered the Andouille sausage and cheddar cheese omelette with hash.   It was super tasty and a nice big portion.  I loved the biscuit and their strawberry jam on the counter was perfect.    The biscuit was huge and fresh from the oven.   I was so stuffed i had enough for breakfast the next morning.   Few pieces of advice - go early or expect to wait awhile.   don't go in large groups as this place is tiny and if you have two people you'll get seated quicker since they have a counter area that you can sit at easier than the larger groups.   The area is a little sketch as it borders the TL but it was fine on a Sunday afternoon in daylight.

Amazing... when I eat breakfast now I feel that I am somehow insulting Brenda's food by calling what I'm eating "breakfast".  This is an amazing place that I'd go to every day if I could. It really is as good as it gets... which means, get there early, put your name on the list and be prepared to wait.  But oh my the wait is worth it.

It pains me to give this place 3 stars.  -1 star because I don't think I'll come back.  -1 star for being extremely heavy and just shy of greasy.  I've been to New Orleans and I appreciate and understand the heavy use of amazing flavorings such as sausage, butter, cheese and cream.  And I have eaten at many places there where I felt I probably needed to head to the "cath lab" at the local ER to remove the blockage.  BUT... in those cases I also walked away feeling satisfied, happy and wanting more (but with my brain saying no from a pragmatic perspective). At Brenda's, I felt it just wasn't pulled off.  I ordered the beignet flight which was definitely worth trying.  I thought the stuffed beignets were a bit crunchy (perhaps they're supposed to be like that when they get fillings) and the unfilled beignet was a tad soggy on the inside (did they add butter?).  Worth a try, certainly.  But frankly I think the beignets are lighter and fluffier at Just for You Cafe.   For the entree, I got the creole seafood fritata.  This was a pretty big let-down actually.  It did have a pleasant flavor of crawfish, shrimp and andouille, but it was drowning in cheddar cheese spread all over the top.  I've had many a fritata that was not good for me, but the cheese totally killed the dish for me and visually was very unappetizing.  The best thing on the plate were the grits.  They're pictured in one of the photos in this review.  Of course there was a 1/4" thick clarified butter slick over the top (I'm sure that added to their yumminess), but the visual was also a big turn off. Three of us gobbled up the beignets, but I could only eat half my fritata and maybe a 1/4 of the grits.  We took it home with us, but I felt so full and so turned off by the thought of eating any more of that breakfast, we tossed it in the garbage before we even got home (the smell in the car after stopping at a book store was overwhelming).   After writing this review, I wonder if I should drop another star, but my gut tells me that for those who haven't tried it, perhaps you'll see something in Brenda's that I missed.  The place was hopping and many are willing to wait upwards of 2 hours to get in on a Sunday morning/afternoon.  We waited an hour and 20 minutes after arriving at 10:15am on a Sunday and while I feel it was worth a try, I won't be going back.

Brenda's is a small, cozy space.  Very few tables with the largest accommodating 4.  I came here with three friends for brunch on a Sunday, so needless to say it was a bit of a wait.  To keep the wait to a minimum, get there early and maybe stick to a party of 2.  Parties of 2 go by quick.  Parties of 4+, prepare to wait. And yes, it is worth the wait (mostly.. I'll explain later).  We ordered the beignet sampler to start.  The crawfish was deliciousss!  It had a little bit of a kick to it.  I also liked the chocolate, maybe not wowed by it, but I really like chocolate in general.  I ordered the andouille and cheddar omelette.  Very good but also very heavy.  I couldn't eat too much of it.  What I could definitely finish though and what I think everyone should order is the grits.  Unbelievably good!  You get the choice of grits or potatoes.  I tried the potato's off my friend's plate and was not overly impressed.. average potatoes.  But amazing grits!  I definitely recommend ordering the grits.  And the biscuit was buttery goodness.  I really love butter so I was very pleased. Service was okay.  We were a bit put off at first because the lady gave our table away when our friend was literally across the street and waiting for the green light.  Our name was called, we pointed to the direction of our friend, who appeared next to us about 10 seconds later and all she could say was, "already gave your table away."  I'm sure she's used to people pulling the "oh, she's just parking the car.." and then not appearing for another 30 minutes but after you've given other parties "last call for so-and-so party of x" and waiting that 10 seconds for them to respond, it's a little frustrating that you wouldn't give our friend that time to cross the street.  We get that you have a policy of not seating incomplete parties, but c'mon.. seriously?!  We ended up having to wait another half hour for our table.  I can't say the food was worth that extra wait.. Overall, I'm happy with the food and will only go as a party of 2 (hungry Jess is not happy Jess).

I probably will not be going anymore unless I can be sure there is no wait... and that means waking up early in the morning to bypass the crowd. The food is really good, but the service I would say is definitely lacking. The servers never seem happy and this last time we went it was particularly bad. Still, nonetheless I will give Brenda's 4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service. What we really enjoy when we come here is the egg and bacon tartine... the bread is perfectly soft, crisp, and not too heavy and the tomato bacon relish on top is what really sets this dish off. It's that combination of slightly sweet and salty. yummm The beignets are good, very filling. I recommend getting the flight of beignets so you can try them all. The catfish po'boy which is a special is also really good, but they are kinda stingy on the catfish... it's a smaller piece and the dish is so good, you really want more of it. I've heard the shrimp po'boy is also really good which we'll have to try next time when I can wake up early enough. :P

Um. Foodgasm. I can't even find the words... you'll understand once you've tasted the crawfish beignets. I had brunch here again with my mum this morning and we waited less than 5 minutes to get seated, but be warned-- if you try to brunch on a Sunday you will be waiting a long, lonnnng time. Sure it's a hole in the wall, sure it's cramped and busy, sure it's in the TL, but still-- the potato pancakes I had this morning were the best pancakes I have EVER destroyed.

When it comes to waiting for brunch, I am of the belief that if I'm not the first person in line, I don't want to be in line. San Francisco has enough great places to eat that you shouldn't have to spend a hungover/hungry/exhausted weekend hour just waiting to get in the door, right?   Well, after my first of what will be many visits to Brenda's, I can say that this is one of the few times that I've ever been happy being wrong. Brenda's was simply outstanding and well worth the wait. To be honest, even the wait wasn't that bad.  You drive up, double park for a moment, sign your name up on the waiting list, drive around for a while until you find a non-metered parking spot, and by the time you find a spot, listen to a few tunes in the car, and start walking back to the restaurant, you should get there right about on time.  Or in my case, you arrive to find your name crossed off the list but walk in anyway where the friendly server understands your situation and still seats you. There isn't a lot of space inside Brenda's so if you don't like people you don't know sitting directly next to you and people brushing past you as they walk by, Brenda's probably isn't for you and I could happily recommend the IHOP on Lombard if you need more space.  But if you're like me and don't mind listening and contributing to other people's conversations, you'll find the layout and decor of the inside perfectly compliments the flavorful, comfort food served inside.  There's even some counter seating on one of the walls that faces a large mirror, giving you the opportunity to both secretly survey the activities of the rest of the restaurant and check yourself out in the mirror, noticing your growing double chin which will remind you of all the delicious, memorable meals that have helped contribute to said double chin. While I've never been to New Orleans or the south, I've eaten enough great meals to know soulful cooking when I taste it and don't know why anyone would ever complain that Brenda's doesn't taste like authentic New Orleans grub as a friend from NO has done.  Good is good and if it's good, there should be no complaints.  I started with a large cup of chicken, sausage, okra gumbo (a steal for $3.50) which, while I have no idea if it was authentic, was so tasty and flavorful, I got really sad when I finished it, as if I had lost an old friend. Next I had the catfish eggs benedict ($10) that came served not on the standard English muffin but on a soft, fluffy, freshly made biscuit! The catfish and pouched eggs were cooked perfectly and topped with a delectable Creole hollandaise sauce that was the best I've ever had. The egg was a little bit set and not really dripping when I cut into it which I actually preferred for this benedict because there was so much of the tasty hollandaise covering the entire biscuit that I liked having the texture of the partially set egg yolk and a completely runny yolk wasn't needed.  The dish also came with an ungodly amount of well-seasoned potato hash that more than once had me asking myself whether I was actually physically capable of finishing everything. This seemed to be a problem of the person sitting next to me who ordered the apple with cinnamon, honey butter beignets as an appetizer (3 huge beignets for $5, that is not a typo), managed to eat one and a half beignets and left a perfectly good, untouched beignet sitting by itself wondering why anyone would ever neglect it so.  When the server came to take his plate, I informed her that I was going to relocate that beignet to my plate and rather than be disgusted by this behavior, she was genuinely happy that I didn't let food go to waste and even came up to me as I was leaving to find out how I liked it. After rescuing that poor beignet from the horrors of a tenderloin garbage bin, the people sitting next to me told me that they were considering doing the same thing so I graciously offered them half the beignet and we both agreed that it tasted great (although I'm not a big fan of apples in desserts but, hey, people picking food off other's plates can't be choosers) and was a perfect way to end such a savory meal. By the end of the meal, I had passed the point of eating to satisfy my hunger or even to enjoy the taste and felt like a marathon runner who just wants the honor of finishing the race, no matter how long it took them to finish.  And I'm proud to say that I was able to finish everything, barely, and could not have been more pleased with my entire dining experience. I came away impressed with Brenda's entire operation, from the quality of the food to the warm servers, to the unbelievably great value you get for your money (nothing on the menu is over $10).  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu, no matter how long the line is.

I was REALLY excited to try this place. My heart and soul belong to soul food and New Orleans. I mecca to NOLA every year. To find a place the fused NOLA, French Cuisine, and soul food sounded like a dream come true. I arrived and was told since I was alone I had the option of sitting at the bar or waiting 10 min for a table. As well all know wait times are usually under estimated but I decided to take it in stride. My name was at the top of the list, the followed by two parties of two and a party of four.  A four top cleared and the hostes skipped my name and called the next party of two in. 15 minutes later a different hostes came and said "It's our policy not to sit singles at our large tables so we are going to call the next couple after you". They sat this couple at a small two top in the window that had been crammed with a third chair. Sure that third chair makes it a large table. By this time, 30 min later, any food that I ordered better be over the moon in perfection to make up for being slid down the waiting list and told to stand around for 30 min.  Not to mention you feel punished for being a single patron. The two tops before be got preferred treatment and I had to wait. Would it have really killed them to sit a single at the smaller of the two tables? Had they been smart they would have sat the 4 top at the 4 top table instead of the couple... but I digress. I ordered the bignets, chicory  coffee, and cheese grits with shrimp. My cup of coffee was tossed at me violently and I asked for a cup of water to go with it and was snarked "it's coming". The coffee taste burnt. I imagine, since I ordered the decafe, it had been sitting as the same pot as morning. Nasty. Beignets came. Basically they had none of the deliciousness of any beignets you would buy in New Orleans. They need to go buy a box of Cafe Du Monde beignets mix and do a comparison. Their beignets were cakey, heavy, topped with crunchy granulated sugar and powdered sugar. Bleck Cheese grits and shrimp. It could have been good had they folded the cheese into the grits vs shredding it on top. Had the shrimp been cleaned and not tasted like dirt. Had they not overwhelmed the dish with sweet tomato relish with bits of pig. The grits were creamy and well cooked. The relish as an accent would have made the dish sing. Shrimp well, they have to be cleaned pr they taste like mud dirt. I didn't get any more water until the end of my meal. I guess single patrons aren't worth serving. No one asked how my meal was. I had my plate taken from me as I was eating my beignet and I had to request it back so I had some place to set my food down. Charming. So sadly that's how the beignets crumbles.

3.5/5 Fresh and lively lunch crowd, high-ceiling, cement walls adorned with a plethora of mirrors. Bright, inviting, and full of life, my lovely guest and I walked in, signed our name on the chalkboard, and after a 10-15 minute wait, were seated. We ordered the following: -Sweet Watermelon House Tea: Refreshing and not too sweet. I like that the watermelon rind is utilized, giving this tea a one-up on most you've probably had. Reminded me of a watermelon aqua fresca. YUM. -Beignet Flight: 4 beignets- plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, and crawfish. The chocolate and granny smith apple were good and surprisingly subtle in sweetness. The plain beignet was flaky and buttery and the crawfish one was just sublime. Out of all four, this was my hands down favorite. Stuffed with succulent crawfish, molten cheddar, and dusted with cajun spices, this was definitely a revelation. Be sure to eat this when its fresh and hot to truly have the ultimate experience! -Hangtown Fry: Crispy oyster, bacon & scallion scramble, with grits, and cream biscuit. RIDICULOUSLY good. C'mon. Crispy oysters AND bacon? How could you go wrong? My taste buds were doing the happy dance. The grits had an exxon pool of butter suspended over it (quite off-putting) and was just ok. The cream biscuit is ginormous and paired with the homemade jam was as Oprah would say "AHHHHHHHHHHHHMAAAZZZING!" HAHA. -Chicken Etouffee: Chicken smothered in spice creole tomato gravy served with rice. Like chicken soup for the soul. I'm a big fan of tomato based sauces and this one was perfectly spiced and layered with such deep flavor. The plain rice served as the perfect canvas to absorb the beautiful flavors of this dish, and together, was just an absolute masterpiece for the taste buds. The unfortunately -1.5 star is at the expense of the rude service. Upon entering and weaving ourselves through the somewhat closely, cramped tables, the heavy set, UNKEMPT lady server bumps into my guest with her back turned and instead of apologizing, turns around, makes eye contact, snarls at my friend, and rolls her eyes. JUST because you had a booty bite and the back side of your shirt was ruffled and bunched up in a VERY unflattering DOESN'T mean you have to be such a _ _ _ _ _. Our male server was pushy, impatient, and didn't space out adequate time to enjoy our appetizer then main entrees. Add to that,  the tables are so closely connected, there's not enough space to put everything down at once without bumping elbows with other customers at the restaurant. Yet despite clearly seeing that it was virtually impossible to put everything down, he takes our plate of beignets away (we weren't finished and does it unannounced), drops down the main dishes, and comes back minutes later with the beignets stacked on a slightly smaller plate, and throws it back on the table. This would of been all fine and dandy, except one of the beignets is dusted with cajun spices and have now mixed with the ones dusted in powdered sugar. RUDE. I understand the restaurant was busy, but we shouldn't have to suffer the brunt end of your frustration at the expense of your lack of composure, professionalism, and time management. FOOD is stellar, SERVICE was disappointing. Let's hope in due time, that the restaurant can iron out its obvious kinks and service can stand at eye level with the high standards set in their food department.

Coming from the oc bubble, this place is located in the hood.  There's tons of dirty streets and homeless G's roaming the streets.   Expect a long long wait and they don't take reservations. Also make sure to come with an empty stomach so you can chomp down on their large portions.   The watermelon ice tea is hit or miss with each batch they make.  sometimes good, sometimes weird tasting.

After hearing I'm from New Orleans, people are quick to discuss three things: music, Katrina and food. Brenda's is almost always suggested as the place to get authentic Southern food. My fellow Nola friends and I finally gave this place a go for dinner and were very happy with the experience. Collectively, we shared two fried shrimp po-boys, a side of macaroni, grits, red beans and rice as well as some hushpuppies, fried chicken and beignets for dessert.   Woooo [loosening my belt now]... ok, where to start. - Fried shrimp po-boys: were pretty good, although I'd probably say that about any in SF given that I'm so desperate for one. The shrimp wasn't Gulf shrimp though (it's farmed). But could I really tell the difference if tested since the batter almost always overpowers the shrimp? Probably not. - The sides were all pretty damn good, including the hushpuppies. I was so happy and nostalgic; I held back tears of saturated-fatted joy. - Beignets: we were in disbelief that any place in SF would house Cafe Du Monde-style beignets (not that Brenda's markets its as such, but one can always hope). It was definitely not the real deal, which we expected given that they offered chocolate and apple-filled options. The filled ones were pretty good, but the hunt for Cafe Du Monde-style beignets continues. Sidenote: I can't wait to try the bread pudding next time. Overall, Brenda's is a great place for experiencing food outside the SF norm. I would suggest trying the food in pairs (groups of four at most) because the actual room probably sits no more than 40 people (although they're expanding). Also not recommended for people who need to talk secretively as you will include the strangers sitting next to you. But hey, that's the Deep South style anyway -- secretive or not.

I came in here at 4:45PM one day.  At 5PM they start their dinner menu. We tried the crawfish beignet, which was pretty good. I got the grits and shrimp, my friend got the dumplings. The dumplings were pretty much "melt in your mouth, love your life/ life is too short to not be eating something this rich" goodness. Amazing. My grits and shrimp was also super rich, and it upset me greatly that I only had a few bites before I could not eat anymore. I took it home but I never finished it. Now that I'm sitting here writing a review, I miss it; bad decision -- always finish your food from Brenda's! People recommended their watermelon tea, but I've tossed watermelon into a blender before and it shouldn't cost that much, especially if you're diluting it with tea. I'd definitely come here again. I live a few blocks away and whenever I have guest, I always try to coerce them into going, but the idea of waiting an hour for brunch is always daunting. However, now that I know what's in store, I'm definitely going to wake up, run downstairs and put my name down, go back up and get ready, and come back down 30 minutes later when my name is about to be called. I know, great plan. Thanks.

The food is good and they serve large portions! As others have said, be prepared to wait in a long line before you are seated. The $8.00 crawfish, with cayenne, scallions & cheddar beignet was tasty. The reason I gave four stars: The long wait in line. Plus, the hash browns were not what I expected (they were more like potato chunks) and not that good.

Brenda's has been on my list for ages, but I've always been intimidated by the line. Last week I finally got my chance and since I went on a Thursday at about 9am I didn't even have to wait in line! The food was outstanding. I had an the Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette. It was huge, the potatoes on the side were crispy and seasoned to perfection and the biscuit was nice and flaky. It was all so filling I had to walk the long way around the block to work some of it off!

Do not come here with a big group. It will be a two hour wait. The most memorable item that would make me go back would be the craw fish beignet. That's the best dish I would say they have. The gumbo, french toast, sweet watermelon house tea were all above decent but nothing amazing. My suggestion...try this place once and get your curiosity over with.

My friends and I ordered the crawfish beignets as an appetizer and they were delicious! The beignets were pretty big so it was enough for the three of us to share (three beignets in total). I ordered the crispy pork belly with cheddar grits and poached egg. The dish was simple but it was very good. Definitely my kind of comfort food. My only complaint is that despite the name of the dish, the pork was not crispy at all. I was expecting the skin to be crispy but instead, it was soft and rubbery so it wasn't something that I wanted to eat. My friends ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict and they were very satisfied with their dishes. Overall, the food at Brenda's is excellent, no doubt about it! In addition, the service was great and our food was ready in no time. The only reason that I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that we had to wait at least an hour and a half to be seated. Though I already expected this from reading all the reviews, it's still a bit frustrating to have to wait that long.

Love love! Granted I have not been to Brenda's yet for its lauded brunch, I must say based on my shrimps-and-grits and crawfish beignet, I have no doubt that this place is a must-go. - crawfish beignets with cayenne, scallions & cheddar - shrimp & grits - sautéed shrimp, cheddar grits, spicy tomato-bacon gravy I happened upon this place while walking through the Tenderloin towards Civic Center. As I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised at the fancy, industrial feel it had - quite a contrast to its surrounding neighborhood. The dining hall is very narrow and the tables are tightly set at elbow-distance to the next diner. No wonder the lines are long during its busiest hours! The compact space would also be difficult for a wheelchair to maneuver as even I had to squeeze between the occupied chairs. The table next to me had a plate of broiled oysters that looked and smelled amazing. Casino - bacon, scallion, gruyère Saint Charles - andouille sausage, cornbread, holy trinity Tchoupitoulas - cayenne butter, garlic, herbs Orleans - bbq sauce Dinner is served 5pm - 10pm, Wednesday through Saturday.

it was a drizzly Thursday.  My work's PO Box was nearby, and I was looking to drop off some mail.  since the PO decided to d/c some of the boxes in the area, that left me to wander the streets wondering if there was any nearby with noon pick-ups (fyi, none thus far, I guess you have to go to the Federal building or to Fox Plaza to drop off  the mail).  I had $10 on me, and a pressing need to get back to the office before we opened the doors up at 11 (it was about 10:20).  They weren't busy at all, maybe 2 tables when I walked in.   I ordered the flight of beignets, since I knew I had to try em, and lacked the cash on me (no cc on me either), and I was barely about to pay for the 4.  She said it would only take 5 minutes, and while it did come pretty quickly it was a lil more than that (only counting since I did have to get back to the office on time).  I could only gaze lustifully at the large bowl-like cups of steaming coffee that a couple of incoming customers ordered (damn that lack of cash!), and smell the lovely scent of dozens of strips of bacon frying (I swear they were trying to torture me!).   I rush back to the office with 10 minutes to spare.  the beignets were still warm....what to do, what to do....I'm manning  the front desk and will have about 10 to 15 minutes of chaos beginning at 11....well, I take stock.  the crawfish can wait.  the others?  Well, since they're piping hot & fresh, it'd be a shame to not experience them in their warm deliciousness.   That's right.  I ate the 3 of them powdered sugar confections of loveliness right there and then.  Over a garbage can.  the plain.  Ummm, yum!  The chocolate, oh goodness, rich and dark...the apple, cinnamon and rich.  Decadent and trashy all at the same time.  What can I say?  I'm from the bay.  And I'm from new jersey.   And then I could face my rush of incoming clients..... 15 minutes later, me and the crawfish, with it's cayenne dusting, oh my.  that was soooo tasty.   I'm scared of the hype about the crowdedness and waiting.  Maybe I'll take the casual carpool early one of these days and try em out at 8am on a weekday......and then I'll try one of their real breakfasts! ooo, last bit, the woman who took my take out order remembered my name and thanked me on my way out the door....nice touch! update 1/24/08 I had the andouille sausage & cheddar omelette last week, and  today the corned beef hash, with a side of grits (and took the leftovers home for tomorrow's breakfast).  The biscuits are freaking yummy!  I think they're possibly the best I've ever had, they don't need butter or jam even! the hash was yummy, very scallion-y and potato-y, rather like on the corned beef, so it's not a meat fest. the sausage & cheddar omelette-wow andouille sausage with a kick to it?  yum! Long wait last week, but even at 8am the place was almost filled up immediately.  Today was wet & freezing out, so there were only two other peeps waiting to be let in at 8am

Nummy stuff! We hit this place up for brunch and it was perfect! I wasn't such a fan of the beignets, but they taste like a donut to me and I don't like donuts so that explains that (though the apple one was yummy). The rest of the breakfast food was great! just really nicely thought through and put together home cooking.  Everything I saw come out of the kitchen looked mouthwatering. The place was tiny and crowded and the line was pretty bad to get in, but one can see why! Great food and it was totally worth the wait. I would love to do it again sometime.

I love the location. We waited around 20 minutes or so for a table at 1pm on a Thursday. The interior is super cute and crowded. I had one of the "Specials" Banana bread pudding French toast with homemade whipped cream, pecans on top with a delicious syrup that was sort of caramel like. It was damn good. Definitely for those with a sweet tooth. Perhaps banana slices or something fresh could have toned it down a little. My friend had the vegan sandwich, also yummi - it reminded me of a sloppy joe. We both ordered something drink and left with a tab of $22  before tip -  I'll definitely be back!

Passed by here the other day and thought this looks interesting! Outstanding food and service. The gumbo was yummy and a little spicy, and the fried oyster scramble with Canadian bacon along with the gritz with tons of butter and cream, and biscuit served with some sort of fruit compote with cinnamon on the side left me wanting for more. Downsides: LONG wait, more than 45 minutes on a Saturday morning and the parking meters along the street eat of rolls of quarters just for an hour of time (not the restaurant's fault of course). If you have patience and a love for great food, than this is the place to see and be seen!

I'd been wanting to go here for awhile, but unfortunately, for me at least, it was a bit overrated.  First of all, wait is crazy ridiculous, but I kinda expected it.. expect a 2-hour wait in the morning towards noon time on the weekends.  We decided to take ours to-go and if you have a small party (like of 2), they might let you just put in a to-go order which'll come out in like 20-30 minutes. Beignets were pretty good (especially the chocolate one) although the crawfish one was slightly strange especially the cajun powder-y outside was too cajun powder-y.. not necessarily in a spicy way, but in a too-much type of way. I got the watermelon sweet tea, and for me, it wasn't sweet enough (although my friend thought it was good).  The watermelon was in there but almost too subtle for me to taste and if I'm getting watermelon sweet tea, I'd want to taste the watermelon, right? I got the granola pancakes and although other people might've liked it, it was kinda not my thing.. had dried cranberries or something in it and a ton of granola and if you put any syrup on it, it was overly sweet and I like sweet!

Don't listen to the people telling you that it's not worth the wait. They're just trying to make you leave so their name gets called sooner. Yes, the wait for this restaurant is ungodly long--upwards of 2 hours if you come at 11am for the Sunday Brunch--but once you're in, you're gonna want to order nearly everything on the menu and take your precious time savoring the cuisine that is French soul food. Everyone likes lists so here's a list: - Beignet sampler: Plain, chocolate, sauteed apple and crawfish. $8. Fluffy. Delicious. We ate the crawfish one first, which was filled with a spicy creamy sauce, and saved the rest for after brunch. Like a brunch dessert! - Gumbo: The bowl size is enough for one's entire breakfast, so I suggest ordering the cup size to get a taste and save enough room for more. The gumbo itself was very smokey, bordering on too smokey, but full of robust flavor. - Eggs Benedict Special: Poached eggs on fried catfish and some of the best cream biscuits ever? Have I had a heart attack and gone to creole heaven? BTW get the grits. You won't be sorry. - Grillades and Grits: Beef cutlets had a strangely tough texture. But everything else was top notch. Get the biscuits.

I've always wanted to try Brenda's after seeing the 1000+ reviews here. I came here on Saturday morning, primetime brunch (doh!) and waited for about 1 hour. Our party of five was seated and snug between lots of tables. As you know from the other reviews this place is tiny -- capacity, I imagine is about 30ppl. I ordered: --Crawfish Beignets (4/5) --Watermelon Iced Tea (3/5) --Gumbo (5./5) --Andouille and Cheese Omlette (3/5) Everything was eh..ok. I mean, it was worth the experience because there was so much hype about this place. Yea, its hype, not so much quality in my opinion. Service? Well, my boyfriend misread the menu which actually said, "WATER service upon request"..as ."WAITER served upon request" which was a big problem. So double doh -- he thought we had to let them know when we were ready to order. He tried to flag the waitress down and boy, did he get his head ripped off. We laughed and said, "get out! no soup for you!" If you want to experience that soup kitchen in Sienfield, its here at Brendas! :) Note: best way to enjoy Brenda's is to try their renowned beignets and watermelon iced tea. Also know that it will be cramped and the waitresses will be a bit feisty. But can you really blame them??

Great place for brunch (haven't been for lunch but I will be back!) Everything we had was delicious. I especially recommend the crawfish beignets, and the gumbo. Watermelon iced tea was great too! All their menu items are a good price and the portions are BIG! We had omelettes and the bacon/tomato thing- all great. Someone next to me got the granola pancakes which looked amazing, so I will be ordering that next time around. Service was unbelieveably friendly and fast, but I did not get the sense that they were trying to rush us out at all. Decor is cute, music was great, and the place is small, which explains the large waittime for a table. Refills on coffee is an added plus. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because wait time can get ridiculous. I suggest going with one or two friends max (no big groups) and getting there before 10am if you dont want to spend way too long waiting for a seat. Other than that, I'm a new found fan of french soul food!

I had the crawfish beignets and the chocolate beignets.  They were as awesome as everyone says they are. Crawfish beignets were delicious and I loved them most.  You get bits of crawfish with Cajun spices and some cheese.  Beignets were dusted in red pepper, but is mildly spiced.  Perfect. Chocolate beignets were also solid.   They have lots of Cajun dishes here and I'd love to come back here if I ever visit SF again.  Their side order of potatoes seemed particularly delicious to me.  Check this place out.   This review is part of my "AWESOME SF DAYTRIP" list.  Check my profile to see my other recommendations.

We talk about food-gasms in the Yelp community, and I avoid using that term loosely. But I will use that term with Brenda's. I was de-virginized yesterday, and I liked it. The food was simply food-gasmic! * I debated over the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette vs. the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette. I went with the Gulf Shrimp, since it sounded more unique. It was incredible! The caramelized onions were exquisite, and the goat cheese worked - to my surprise - very well! It was an unexpectedly good combination. * I chose the grits, and was not disappointed (even after my high expectations of grits coming from: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). * And I LOVED the cream biscuit (but, who wouldn't?). * The watermelon iced tea was fab. * And I even got to snag a bite of the Fried Shrimp Po-boy (which I wasn't sure I would like) - I loved it! All around awesome breakfast/lunch joint. AMAZING food. p.s. we called ahead and picked-up, so no comment on the wait. :)

Brenda's French Soul Food is painfully good. The type of good that makes your serotonin levels do somersaults. The type of good that makes your chest bottom out into an audible sigh of relaxation. For a place that is the size of a matchbox, there is something uniquely comforting about the place, so much so that you wont mind bumping elbows with the patron to your left (sorry, guy). The place has a menu that bubbles over with flavor. Let me tell you that these are the best grits you're bound to have. Buttery, creamy, and completely free of that paste-driven stuff you're bound to find dubiously sitting at Denny's. You can feel your veins being marbled with this wonderful, unspeakably delicious evil. Alongside the grits, I had fluffy eggs and bacon that popped. Washing it down with watermelon iced tea was the biggest surprise. Not doused in artificial flavoring, the watermelon was watermelon, and it was ladled into black tea. The swirling tornado of fruit and tea was...well...invigorating. Despite the fact that you have to check people into the boards to get into the restaurant, you will end up thanking yourself. Just be prepared for the occasional wait - and waiting outside of a restaurant in the tenderloin can lead to unsavory moments of awkwardness with the local street folk (that means you, homeless dude who wished me bad karma because I only gave you a dollar).

For the most part it was worth the wait on a Sunday afternoon.  We headed over there around 1pm and the wait was about 35 mins. The crawfish beignet was a bit try for my liking.  The Granny-Smith apple was probably one of my favorite along with the plain one.  The chocolate one was so-so.   We also had the shrimp and grits and that was pretty amazing! It was very flavorful, but I must admit, a bit too cheezy...I mean, once in a while, it wouldn't hurt, I guess!  The shrimp was tasty and a generous portion. Don't forget the watermelon sweet ice tea that kept on coming! It really hit the spot on the very hot day we were there!   Overall: I'd like to go back and give the other items on the menu a try.  I looked around and it certainly looked very tempting and delicious.

Brenda's is a terrific little breakfast/ brunch spot nestled in the Tenderloin. It really is little, but the stuff that comes out of that is absolutely yum-may! The wait can be a bit lengthy, but it's worth every minute. Once my chocolate beignets came out, I forgot about the 40 minutes I spent standing outside. These poofy, sugar-sprinkled pillows are filled with decadent Ghirardelli chocolate; and the awesome part was that you get 3 of them!!! They're huge -and filling. I ordered a cup of grits, but there wasn't anything spectacular about it. I'm most likely coming back but next time, i'm going to order the spinach eggs benedict. :)

I've been told about it, I've dreamed about it, and I finally got to experience it.  What the heck am I talking about?  A beignet flight.  That's right, I said beignet flight bit*$@%! Absolutely amazing.  Now I've had beignets from New Orleans and still dream about the fried batter puffs with enough powdered sugar to make royal icing on a wedding cake.  But Brenda's takes it a step further.  Not just plain, but with chocolate and apple filled.   That doesn't impress you, you say.  But wait...there's more!   The fourth was a savory crawfish beignet. Can I get a "Wha Wha?" You heard me - savory crawfish beignet.  This was just culinary genius.  Never thought I would like it, but not only did I love it, I wanted more.  But alas, I had ordered the hangtown fry and could go no further. Weekday is definitely the way to go.  I went on a Friday morning and was seated sans waiting.  Service was pleasantly casual and felt pretty authentically southern.  This place is not for the faint of heart.  You will get filled up.  I probably could have stopped at the beignet flight and been fine.  But sit back, order a watermelon ice tea and relax while waiting for your meal.  It's a nice treat in this neck of the woods.   Next time - that red beans and rice is mine!

I heart you Brenda!!! You know it's love when the whole restaurant went dark for 4 seconds with no electricity and the whole place went "Awwwwwwww!" and then "YAY!" when the lights came back on. I love the new biscuits..the flavor and texture has redeemed my former views of it being KFC-esque...no way! They're big and bold...much like your fried catfish eggs Benedict I scarfed up on Sunday. The service was top notch...and as a group of six, it was hard to sit us all together but the effort you guys made, was worth it. And so was the watermelon ice tea...more refills please (hehe). You made my grumpiness go away...thank you...my friends thank you cause I can be "B"-itchy when my blood sugar is really low.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he loved it! It was one of the places I had been dying to go to and knowing how much people raved about the place, I figured I'd kill 2 birds with one stone by going to place I wanted to go to and treating my boyfriend out for breakfast. The wait for this place can take forever and you have to wait outside, but hey they immediately disclose that on their wait list so if you don't like it or are impatient then this isn't the place to be. The restaurant is very small, but cozy and the staff is amazing. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of our waitress, but she was very attentive and helped suggest some of the better breakfast dishes. I got the Andouille and cheddar omelet and my boyfriend got the Creole veggie omelet. Both were delicious. We ended our meal with an order of the classic, plain beignets, which were served warm and I could tell it was fresh! A great place to come for breakfast or brunch, but just remember to be patient with waiting! We lucked out and only had to wait about 15 minutes since there were 2 of us and most of the people waiting were in large groups.

One of my friends recommended Brenda's and I was definitely not disappointed.  I was disappointed, however, by the ridiculous wait.  We got there around 1:30PM but didn't get seated until almost 3:00PM.   The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth the hour and a half wait.   We ordered the crawfish beignets, which were, um, way too bready to be beignets. In my experience beignets are light and fluffy.  Anyway, they were still tasty and I loved the cayenne pepper sprinkled on top.  There was a nice spicy kick, in addition to the cheesiness. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict w/catfish (delish) and I ordered the shrimp po boy (even more delish!).  The shrimp was amazing--lightly battered and crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside.  The chipotle rémoulade accompanied the sandwich perfectly! Oh, and the watermelon iced tea was fabulous.  My boyfriend ordered coffee but he kept taking sips of my watermelon iced tea! If you're planning on brunch at Brenda's, I would recommend coming here right at 8AM when they open.

Oh my goodness. Okay let's get the basics out of the way: yes, it's a long wait, but yes, they do takeout too. So if you're not down with waiting for the magic chalkboard to come upon your name, then go for the takeout option. BF and I saw the line and decided to do takeout instead -- he got the Grillades & Grits and I got the Eggs Benedict with Molasses Ham. Both of our dishes was so tasty and both come in big portions. The creole hollandaise sauce was superb, especially on the grits. The wait in total for the takeout was 20 minutes which was just enough time to grab some coffee from Philz, which is the block over.

Amazing Brunch at this spot. Been 3 times now with three different people and never been disappointed. Warning:  It is in the Tenderloin hood so be prepared to see crack-heads and trannies. Warning:  Wait times are 45 minutes on weekends Recommendations:  Shrimp and Grits.   Watermelon iced Tea.

It's good.  It's popular.  It's small.  It's an awful wait. We couldn't stand waiting in the cold any longer so we ended up getting the goods to go.  The crawfish beignet was generously seasoned/spiced and was my absolute favorite.  An improvement would be replacing the chocolate beignet with a Nutella beignet. Note:  If you're just going to try a flight of beignets, save yourself some time and ORDER TO GO. ------------------------ Update:  Guess they're expanding. "Just thought I would send you a quick note- I'm the sister of one of the owners, and just FYI- they're expanding! They bought the little chinese laundry next door and its currently under renovation- so the wait times and small space issues will soon be solved! (Plus, they are going to have a separate to-go counter!) Just FYI..."

Awesome breakfast/brunch spot. Maybe not quite as good as Dottie's but the line was shorter, Brenda's is classier, and they have butter pecan sauce for their French toast. I had French Toast ($7) with Butter Pecan Sauce ($1) and a side of Potato Hash ($2.50). The French toast was good; three thick slices of bread with cinnamon and icing sugar. It didn't have the amazing texture of the ones I had at Dottie's but the pecan sauce was freaking awesome. The potato hash was excellent and had lots of spices. I also had a Beignet Flight ($8) to go. This got me one each of the four varieties of these New Orlean's style donuts: plain, apple, chocolate, and crawfish. The dough of the beignets was very tasty but the fillings were hit or miss. I found the crawfish to be much too fishy tasting for breakfast and the apples in the apple beignet, while good, could have been a bit softer. I'd stick with the sweet beignets next time.

I finally got on the Brenda's French Soul Food Train! And I don't wanna get off! Small place on Polk, b/w Turk & Eddy in the city's tenderloin district. Maximum occupancy is 40 so keep that in mind when ordering your food. Tabletop space is limited :-) I couldn't decide what to order off of the menu so I narrowed it down to the specials which included Hangtown Fry (oyster & bacon scramble w/grits or hash browns or toast), Red Beans & Rice, Chicken Ettoufee, Fried Catfish Po Boy, Sweet Potato Pancakes, or Shrimp & Grits. I chose the etouffee (partly because I just wanted to say it).  It didn't disappoint.  I've only ever had Crawfish or Shrimp Ettoufee and I was feeling really hesitant about having this dish with poultry. But... It was absolutely incredible.  It actually reminded me of the most heavenly Crawfish Etouffee I first experienced at K-Pauls Louisiana Kitchen about 15 years ago! I also had the flight of beignets.  While I loved all the varieties, I really wasn't too please with the 'plain' beignet.  I found it a bit too 'thick' for my taste.  I'd still go to Just For You Cafe in the Dogpatch for my plain beignets. True to Cafe du Monde form, I had to order a Cafe au lait to have with my beignets.  And I also had to try the ever-popular Watermelon Iced Tea - wow!  What a wonderful concoction.  I can't wait to have all these flavors swim around in my mouth again. I can't wait to go back here.  If you're lucky, you might actually be able to witness Brenda herself cookin' up a storm.  It was great to see her thriving in her element.

Came here on a late saturday afternoon. Lucky that there's no line and actually there's only a few people in there~ I've read and heard a lot of good things about the brunch but obviously they don't serve bruch until 4pm. They have a "In between" menu from 3p (or 3.30p) to 5p (or 5.30p) At first we were disappointed that the beignet was not on the menu, but when we asked they said they do serve beignet the whole day!! So we went ahead ordered the crawfish beignet that was highly recommended by my coworker and it was SO GOOD! It was not oily and there was quite a lot of crawfish. This was my first time having beignet and I really liked it! We have also ordered the hushpuppies. This was one of the best that I've ever had! Then we ordered the braised pork rillettes. I like the little toasts that came with the dish! Watermelon ice tea was nice. Latte was alright. I wish they have brown sugar for my coffee. Oveall it was a decent meal~ I would definitely come back for their brunch! I really want to try out their chocolate beignet too!!

Date: October 24, 2008 @ 8:15 AM. Occasion:  Weekday brunch in lieu of lunch. Girlfriend:  Alexis Venue:  In the heart of the Tenderloin is an inconspicuous and very easy to miss very cute, red-brick restaurant right next to Taco Bell.  Look for the handwritten menu board on the sidewalk and people waiting in line outside of the restaurant.  Very small and narrow inside. Not recommended for claustrophobics. Just enough  elbow room but cozy. Social Scene:  Young couples.  Granma in mu-mu dress dining by herself.  2 young professionals having an early lunch (very early)--us :).   A group of pencil-pushers/money-makers.  4 people waiting outside for a table. Service:  Friendly but slow.  One server for the whole place.  3 cooks in the kitchen whom you will bump into when you use the bathroom in the back.  Coffee was not refilled until the tab was delivered. Treats:  2 orders of Community and chickory coffees. ($2.25 each) a)  Very light and fluffy pumpkin pancakes with ginger butter for Alexis. ($9.25). Very good per Alexis. b)  Flight of beignets (plain, apple, chocolate and crawfish) for me. ($8)             Verdict:  a) All the beignets were not as light and fluffy as I had them at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans where I had them for 5 days straight.   b) Chocolate beignets were decadent and oozing with rich chocolate but I like my beignets just plain and sugared just like I had them in the South. c) Ate the apple beignet the next day for breakfast.  It was dried out maybe because it was a day old. Good apple filling. Strong nutmeg flavor.  Will not order it again. d) CRAWFISH BEIGNET is the BOMB!!!! Oh, my gosh,  I will be dreaming in warm melting cheese and bits of crawfish pastry dusted with slightly hot/slightly sweet cayenne pepper from now on until my next fix!   Tab: $28.54 To Do:  Get an order of crawfish beignet next week for me and boyfriend.

I finally made it here this past Saturday..The pleasant surprise was my girlfriend got there at 10:00, put in our name and when I arrived at 10:15 we were seated!  This may have been an off day because I hear the wait is normally insane.   To start we ordered the very strong coffee (chicory) and the chocolate beignets which were to die for.  These would have satisfied me alone.  The buttery, flaky biscuits that came with my ham and eggs were also fantastic.  I could only eat half of my breakfast as I was so full from that scrumptious, ghiradelli chocolate filled pillow.  My girlfriend ordered the gumbo which I sampled and was also very good.  The couple next to us ordered the crawfish beignets which looked  a little too rich for my taste.  I can't wait to take more friends to try this little gem of a restaurant.

Totally overrated. I'm a huge fan of soul food after spending significant time in New Orleans and Atlanta. Nothing on the menu lives up to the standard set by the top soul food restaurants in the south. The watermelon ice tea isn't good, I would rather have a glass of plain ice tea any day. The beignets were a total failure, they lacked any true southern flavors. They also use way too much garlic in some of their dishes. So dissapointed.

I've been to Brenda's two times now - once at 8am, and once at 11am - both on Sunday.  The difference?  A two hour wait. No, seriously. Worth it?   YES. The first time I ordered the croque monsieur, and it was decent.  The second time, I wised up (and urge you fellow Yelpers to do the same) and ordered the catfish eggs benedict.  The catfish, fried to perfection, was the perfect ingredient in the dish alongside the runny yellow eggs.  The crawfish beignets are very thick, but the flavor is delicious.  If your sweet tooth is itching you, the cinnamon apple beignets are also delightfully packed with satisfyingly sweet saucy goodness.  The gumbo is also delicious, and the service is friendly. The space is small, so choose your bestest closest friends, show up early, and uninvite the rest.  You won't regret it as you're enjoying your savory Southern cooking in a cozy space.

Other than the shaddy walk to get to the restaurant and the 1 hour wait (had a party of 6 plus long line because everyone loves this place I was okay with it) it was delicious. I had just ran the San Francisco marathon and was ready to eat. I had my first beignet! They were so delicious and have muliple kinds to try: granny smith with cinnamon, ghirradelli chocolate, plain, and something else. I went plain because I'm a plain girl. Loved it plus powdered sugar. Had nice juicy sausage and their fruit cup was good. My dad loved the french toast. Their biscuits were really good. Have a variety of eggs benedict too. I would recommend coming early but the wait is worth it!

What you should get when you go there for the first time: Beignet flight Gumbo Coffee (w chicory) Watermelon ice tea po'boy What you will make sure to get again EVERY TIME you go Gumbo Grits Whatever pancake special has nuts on it Either coffee or Ice tea Everything else is fun to try and has never failed to impress me; from the grillades to every omelette to the french toast.

Great beignets, as I'm sure thousands of other reviewers have noted.  We got the sampler and tried them all, and they were all great (except the crawfish, which was just..... wrong). The rest of the breakfast was good.  I'm not sure I'd ever go back, though, because the wait is just too damn long (and is the reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4).  We waited almost 2 hours, during which my wife left to go to the Asian Art museum to check some stuff out while I waited around playing games on my Nexus One. Sometimes a place can just get too popular for its own good.

Yes, yes, yes to the crawfish beignets!!  I definitely should have gotten three of those instead of the flight (which included only one crawfish beignet and one each of the other way less impressive beignets -- regular, apple, and chocolate).  And don't try to order too off menu; it doesn't really work.  Oh, and really good coffee.  The surrounding parking meters have 1 Hr limits...

This is such a quaint and cute place. I went here for lunch with a friend of mine a few weeks ago after reading so many positive reviews. The beignet flight was AMAZING. I wasn't a big fan of the chocolate one because it was TOO sweet, but it was still really yummy. I had the andouille sausage &cheddar omelette with their home potatoes & biscuit. Mmm! My friend had the shrimp & goat cheese omelette with grits & biscuit. I didn't try her dish, but she loved it. I did try the grits & they were yummy. The plates were huge and we were already semi-stuffed from the beignets, so bring your appetite! I would definitely come here again to try their other dishes & have me some more beignets =)

Got here at 8:20am for brunch & still had to wait 45-60 minutes for a table for 4. It is a tiny tiny restaurant. The best thing was the crawfish beignets. An order comes with three huge ones! I could've gotten full just off of this! The catfish eggs bennedict was just okay. The catfish didn't have enough flavor. It was really bland. Love loved the cheesy buttery creamy grits! Could not get enough of that! It's served in a pretty decent size bowl & I did not leave a drop left in that thing! Honestly, the food isn't really worth the wait. I've waited longer at other brunch spots & thought other places were worth it, but not here. Meeeh.

I went here for lunch to get breakfast...It was very good. Normally breakfast food makes me want to hurl (thanks to McDonald's breakfast "food") but this was an exception. I had the bacon and egg tartine or whatever it's called. The hash was awesome. And the egg was scrambled well and everything worked really well together. I also got a biscuit b/c I heard people are practically having orgasms over them. It was okay. Nothing to really write home about. I was actually surprised about how small the place was. It literally is just this hole in the wall place and it was very cramped. I had to accidentally hit a few people to talk to someone. The woman was nice, but clearly overwhelmed as I think other people have said. Took abt 10 minutes to get my food (I had take-out) Overall very good. Probably not going back any time soon just b/c it's more expensive than I care to spend on breakfast-type food. Not saying that's all they have, but it's what they're known for

I LOVE BRENDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! I don't know why, maybe I am in extremely good mood, haha! Got here around 2 p.m. Saturday, I was all prepared for the wait. I kept telling myself that some parties in front of me will give up eventually so I kept waiting and waiting... Name called, some were already gone, the list got shorter and in 40minutes my friend's name is called, yay! To make the best out of my first visit, we ordered the Beignet Flight, a small cup of Gumbo, Egg Benedict with fried catfish, Fried Shrimp Poboy and another sandwich which I forgot what's called. ANYWAY, they were all VERY DELICIOSOOOO! The beignets were a surprised, I didn't expect it to be that good, I especially love the one with craw fish and chocolateeeeeee! Gumbo is pretty heavy in taste which I like. Egg Benedict is alright, but the grit is so good! Although I was very very full, I just could not stop diggin' on my grits yumyum! I loved my friend's Poboy, that's probably what I will order next time......... YUM! Oh I had the watermelon sweet tea too, but I think it's too much of watermelon cause I did not taste the TEA! But I liked it, it's not too sweet and refreshing! Wuhoo!

Brenda's is pretty good. There was a bit of a wait for a Tuesday morning.  And it didn't help that we had to flee from a very aggressive homeless man in a wheel chair and missed our name being called. Inside was really warm, a little sweaty, and definitely over-crowded.  There were two waitresses on shift; One was really nice and the other was not.   The food, however, was delicious.  I got the blueberry cream cheese french toast.  It was so incredibly good.  The cheesy grits were the best I've ever had that weren't homemade.  Lunch Date really liked the shrimp po' boy.  And the watermelon sweet tea was worth the trip alone.  The beignets looked phenomenal.  Can't wait to try them next time.

This was the highlight of my visit to San Francisco, this time around.  I loved the atmosphere in the restaurant, and our server was fun to talk to.   I had pork rilette with toasts and pickled watermelon for the first time.  I also tried their breaded sausage and pepper oysters.  Both appetizers were excellent. My entre featured spicy fried chicken, buttery collared greens and biscuits with red pepper jelly. I seriously couldn't have enjoyed this dinner more.

Brenda's you make me happy!!!! FOOD: -Beignet flight: Plain, Chocolate, with molten Ghirardelli chocolate     Granny Smith Apple, with cinnamon honey butter     Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions & cheddar     Absolutely... incredible.  I have to say... those beignets were pretty sensual. My favorite is the crawfish, it melts in your mouth... -Shrimp & Grits: Sautéed shrimp, cheddar grits, spicy tomato-bacon gravy Perfection! I've tried to make this at home, but I can't quite capture the creamy, savory texture explosion.. -Coffee: soo strong! makes me wired for hours til I crash ENVIRONMENT: -The wait drives me nuts, but the reward ends up being worth it. - I always have a hard time parking, so I either park far away or have to bring a big bag of quarters. -You are practically sitting on the lap of the person next to you.

I think that my first visit was a product of ordering the wrong stuff. I was just here the other day and figured I'd keep it simple, remembering the less exciting tasting more innovative dishes. I had 2 eggs over easy, hash and a biscuit and was blown away. I think that Brenda's actually has the very best biscuits, better than Just For You and Lois'. And, I tried my friend's grits, which, again, blew the competition AWAY! The hash was killer, but I couldn't finish everything on my plate. Highly recommended!

French and Soul Food...great combo A lot of people have been raving about this place and I have been looking for a substitute to Blackberry Bistro in Oakland. This place was well worth the drive out to SF. I had the shrimp and grits, gumbo, and beignets...yes I know that is a lot of food. I was especially excited about the beignets and was only slightly disappointed. They were very tasty but I was expecting amazing due to all the hype. The gumbo was excellent but the real winner here was the shrimp and grits. It was one of the daily specials; so, if you see it order it! It came out piping hot...just the way I like my food. Great seasoning and spices and who doesn't love cheese? I am normally not a huge fan of grits but they pack so much flavor into this dish you hardly notice you're eating grits. Wasn't too happy with the customer service. There were two waitresses and one was very friendly and helpful. The other basically did her job. I can't really fault her because she was a good waitress in the sense that she did her job and didn't forget anything. BUT the entire time she seemed annoyed by customers and any requests. This place is definitely a must try! Come hungry because the portions are a good size. It is also great for sharing if you want try a little of everything!

My friend and I decided on this place for lunch yesterday... It was pouring down rain... but after reading the reviews of this place... I have been dying to try it out! We came at a perfect time when a few tables were being cleared.. it was around 1pm... I ordered the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette with Biscuit and Grits.  My friend ordered the Friend Shrimp Po-boy.  We also shared a Crawfish Beignet. I really enjoyed the beignet... never had one before.. but being the first time... i thought it was yummy!  The omelete didnt feel spectacular... but OMG the freaking Biscuit was so damn amazing.. just thinking about it is making me hungry for some!  Even better dipping it in the grits!  I had to say... i love my butter... but the grits was like butter soup!  It was enjoyable... if this is original down south southern style grits... i think I would prefer a little less butter... But other than that.. the grits was still great! I just kept thinking of my heart... hoping that i would not go into cardiac arrest! lol  I definitely want to come here again and try the other stuff on the menu... I dont think i would get the omelette again only because I didnt think it was anything special.. still good though... my friends po-boy was definitely better.

Bursting-at-the-seams good food! After a short wait on a Friday morning, I was seated at a bar area along the wall. It took me seconds to decide on what I wanted - eggs & bacon tartine (per the recommendation of some yelpers on here) and chocolate beignets. Too bad the beignets are humungous and come in threes! Fortunately, another traveler sitting next to me agreed to share his, so I wouldn't die of sugar overload and saved me a few coppers. Yay! The eggs tartine was surprisingly unboring. Though you can't go wrong with bacon and eggs, the hearty salsa on top made this more flavorful and interesting. I was a little sad that I didn't get a biscuit with it though. The standout though were the cheesy grits! It has been a long, soul-wrenching time since I have had grits (probably waffle house 3 years ago), and grits this good! Yes! Yes! Yes! The portions are super filling. I took some to go and warmed it up in a lounge at the airport so I could eat it on my flight that afternoon. Everyone on the plane may have been upset about my aromatic meal during takeoff, but really, they were just jealous! I wish I could transport Brendas to NY. P.S. Beignets + chocolate = HEAVEN!

The food was out of this world.  It was the perfect mix of filling, savory, authentic and unique.  My only problem with the place was its size, but honestly, that can't be helped.  Their home-made juice can be seen at the register in what looks like a big ole Sangria jug -- it was pretty dang good.  Make sure you read the mirror for specials, as they are good good good.  DROOL. Also try to come here with the understanding that you'll probably have a wait; if you have to urinate, try to go before you come -- you have to navigate your way through perhaps the smallest kitchen in the world.

Man oh man oh man oh man! God dayam that was a good breakfast! I've never had seafood for breakfast, but the clam and bacon omelette was... great. The watermelon ice tea? Great. The atmosphere? Also Great. Great + Great + Great = Disgusting... just kidding. It was great. Best breakfast I've ever had ever.

Went back with my GF for Sunday brunch.  Got there early, around 830, so it wasnt crowded yet.   Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict with Spicy Hollandaise on Biscuits, with Grits.  Amazing.   Bananas Foster French Toast with Rum Sauce.   Off da hook!   Its basically the best shit ever.  Best brunch ever.  Keep in mind tho, that I consumed about a 10,000 calorie meal, and my body was in complete and utter shock from the triglycerides and other madness and insanity etc etc.  I was still full around 7 pm, only about 10 hours later.  Didnt eat anything else the whole day.   Still Awesome.  Great service too.  Im taking anyone that comes to visit me in SF there fo sho

Every time I drive by, there is a line out the door.  I also have heard alot about this place and decided to check it out.  Stuffed and tired from cooking Thanksgiving, I showed up to Benda's for breakfast the next morning.  To my surprise, there was plenty of parking and no line (highly unusual). The decor has a cool industrial look with exposed brick and concrete walls.  The place also has great natural lighting with large sky lights. Here is what I ordered: Watermelon Sweet Ice Tea - it hits the spot with watermelon chunks that can be sipped through a straw. Original Beignets - beignets were coated with a nice layer of powdered sugar.  However, the beignets were a bit thick and heavy for my taste. Shrimp & Grits - Not a fan. Grits were overpowerd by cheese which made it seem like my "breakfast/brunch" was an entree for dinner.

Yes, the line can be disheartening, but the food makes it so worth it!!  Been here 3 times this year and would be here weekly if I lived close by. The crawfish beignets are a must.  It comes in 3, but you'll only (begrudgingly) share just one ;) The gumbo is terrific!  I also ordered the fried chicken which was pretty good.  My wife had the pancakes with bananas which was very good as well.  She says their coffee is "excellent".  I went with the watermelon ice tea, which is super refreshing!

I guess I stand as one of the few because I was (whispers) sort of disappointed by Brenda's. The beignets were interesting, but I've had better. The crawfish beignet had too much powder on top, which gave it a bitter taste. I really liked the apple and cinnamon one-super sweet and delicious-- but it also wasn't a combination I haven't had before. To me, it was basically an apple pie rolled into a donut. The BF ordered the egg and bacon tartine, and in all honesty it tasted like a breakfast dish I could order anywhere. Not very inspired. The watermelon iced tea was refreshing but nothing special. After waiting more than an hour for this (and having to check my meter twice in the process), Brenda's was not worth the wait. Next please!

Love it! Good start to the story right? I've been here about four times now over the course of a couple years. The first three times I went, it was in their much smaller space, about the size of a closet.  I was literally bumped into every couple of minutes or so, as there just wasn't enough room for people to maneuver.  But hey, that was just part of the experience. The good news is that they have moved right next door into a larger space. It still isn't big by any means, but it's larger and nicer and still has that small restaurant charm.   So enough about the space, how is the food?  Unique, excellent, delicious, etc. etc. etc..  Here's what I have tried throughout my visits... Beignets - Crawfish Spiced with cayenne, scallions and cheddar House Favorites - Hangtown Fry Crispy oyster, bacon & scallion scramble, with grits or hash, plus cream biscuit or toast House Favorites - Shrimp & Grits Sautéed shrimp, cheddar grits, spicy tomato-bacon gravy Off The Griddle - Housemade Granola Pancakes with Fruit Drizzled with vanilla bean cream My only advice is check it out on a weekday morning, to avoid the long wait.  This place is a "must try."  A highly recommended SF experience!

After an hour and 10 minute grueling wait on Easter sunday sat down for brunch.  Service is quick as pretty much we had decided what to eat during the wait.  Had the beignet platter, chicken gumbo, shrimp&grits, Hangtown Fry   .. The crawfish beignet was THE best on the plate.   Chicken gumbo(cup) is pretty filling and bit salty. Shrimp&grits - THE best.. with cheese toppings and spicy bacon tomato sauce.   Hangtown Fry - oyster, ham, bacon scramble with potatoes.. loved their potato version.. Dining here at the restaurant is not a big deal or a must-dine ambiance, but it is great for to-go food.  Parking is easy around the block.

Woulda coulda shoulda - I regret not having researched Brenda's a bit more carefully. I stopped by here for dinner w/my fiance - she was the winner.  She ordered the croque monsieur and it was delicious.  The layer of melted gruyere over the smoldering ham was delicious. While poor me was "fried out" as I ordered the fry basket - fried oysters, fried catfish, fried shrimp, hush puppies, fries etc.  You get the picture, my heart still kept ticking tho.  I guess Brenda's idea of veggies was the side of coleslaw and watermelon pickles (LOL).  Advice, order this with a group of at least 4 so you all can sample. Fortunately, all was not lost as we ordered the flight of beignets (plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish).  The crawfish beignet was hands down my favorite. The next time I go to Brenda's I will need to try the shrimp & grits along with a mix of sides. Glad I walked the mile there and back to my hotel :)

For post-finals-hangover-breakfast, my friend Kate and I traded the line at  Dottie's for the line at Brenda's. It might have been the best decision of my semester. We were lucky enough to snatch a table, and our server was delightful and attentive. At one point my stomach took over my brain and I had to ask for something to nibble on while we waited for the main meal.  She was back in 30 seconds with fresh strawberry jam and biscuits. I almost cried, it was so delicious.   I ordered the bacon and egg tartine, which actually made me cry. Granted I have been pretty emotional since I finished finals, I have never had a more delicious brunch. The bread was sweet; the bacon salty; the Gruyre smoky.  I was in foodie-heaven, in a restaurant I could actually afford. Thank you Brenda! I will hopefully be back every Friday for biscuits and ice-tea next semester.

The Beignet's here are ridiculous. especially the one with crawfish. And that's enough for four stars.  The biscuits are good enough to make a meal out of..

I love Brenda and I love Brenda's. Whenever I go here, I can feel the energy put into the food and the restaurant. I think a lot of people can, as there is always a wait after 10:30 on weekends and after 11:30 during the week. The neighborhood is certainly diverse. It is near City Hall, the not so great part of Polk, and Russian Hill. In my opinion, Brenda's is the jewel of whatever neighborhood it is in. So, the wait time. That is the only flaw here. Truthfully, how was Brenda to know how popular she would be in the first year? She could not have known, I just hope there are thoughts of an expansion or second location. Then, we can all say,"I knew it back when...." I have gone about a dozen times and each time, the food is wonderful. The Beignets are wonderful. I went there a Beignet period, Morgan knows what I refer to, so I am still not eating them, as I have ate enough for an entire lifetime. I love the crawfish (more savory) and the chocolate (sweet of course). The croque monsieur is good, any special is delicious. The watermelon tea gets better every time. I didn't like it the first, just as I didn't like sparkling water the first year, now I enjoy both....Acquired tastes. If you don't want to wait, get there early. If you are going to sleep in and wait, just surround yourself with cool people. Brenda's is not a place to skip or forgot, it is a place to try and eventually, love. Under no circumstances, except getting there when it opens, do you go there with more than your three best friends, meaning four people. Go with your best friend, two best friends, or even three, but that's it. I love it here!

When my girlfriends said that we should go to brunch in the Tenderloin I was a bit skeptical. But when we showed up on a rainy Sunday afternoon I couldn't believe the large crowd of people waiting outside! Now that I've eaten there, I can say that the long wait is completely worth it. We started with the beignet flight, which was AMAZING. There are some times in life where you have to ignore calorie counting, and this is one of them. Trust me! I moved on to the shrimp and goat cheese omelet, which was fantastic. It had caramelized onions which gave it a really great flavor. It was served with a fresh, hot biscuit (yum!) and a side of grits which were equally as good.

When Brenda's Shrimp Po Boy made 7X7 Mag's 100 Things To Try Before You Die, the roomies and I just had to go.  It was a lazy Sunday, and we were all starving, so we opted to drive instead of taking the muni. We drive up to the corner of Polk and Eddy St and found it odd to see this massive line in front of KFC/Taco Bell.  And sure enough, it wasn't chicken or nachos people were in line for, but Brenda's French Soul Food! My roomate put our name on page 2 of the list, which meant we were in for a wait. But being the determined foodies we are, we decided to tough it out.   An hour and a half later, our party was finally called! We were extatic. By that time we had already memorized the specials outside, so we wasted no time in ordering. We started off with the Beignet Flight--1 Plain, 1 Apple, 1 Chocolate, and 1 Crawfish.  There were 4 of us, so my roommate Gene M. had the ingenious idea to put each beignet on a plate and rotate so we all could get a bite of each one.  The Plain and the Crawfish beignets came out winners.  We all thought the Apple and the Chocolate were a bit too rich. Then came the rest of the meals-- Cream Cheese French Toast with Blueberry Compote and Walnuts--- deeeelish. Andouille Sausage, Mushroom, and Cheese Omelette with Hash Browns and a fluffy 3 inch thick Biscuit! --- Yum! Finally, the Fish Po Boy--- Very tasty!   So long story short, we all had one satisfying Sunday brunch.  They didn't have the Shrimp Po Boy that we originally came for, but now we have one more reason to come back again soon!

This place loses a star because the staff is not the friendliest.  Not sure what crawled up their ass that morning, but needless to say, we could have done without the attitude. I had the watermelon tea, which was good, but nothing spectacular.  My husband hated it, so you'll have to make up your own mind. The chocolate beignets are really good and something you just have to try while here.  I had the banana foster french toast and it was really good.   The place is extremely tiny, so get there early or risk having to wait outside for a long time.

Honestly cannot think of a better brunch I've had in this city.  Ever.  Well worth the wait - if nothing else, it'll give you time to work up a monstrous appetite, which is exactly what you'll need to face one of their dishes. Shrimp and Grits:  EXCELLENT.  Grits are swimming in oil but it's yummy. Creole Veggie Omelet:  VERY GOOD.  I got it with egg whites.  Yes, it's meatless, but there's really nothing you can get here that is healthy.  Make peace with this fact before you step through the doors and you'll have a much easier time of it. Grillades and Grits:  EXCELLENT.  Suuuuper cheesy grits - delicious.  I read in a previous review that the breaded beef was tough, but this was not my experience.  It was kind of like a japanese katsu dish Beignet Flight:  GOOD.  Easily the least standout dish I tried.  If you're craving something sweet, it's good.  For me, the chocolate and the apple were too sweet.  The crawfish one was awesome - like nothing I've ever tried before.  And the plain is great with the housemade jam at the table. Gumbo:  GOOD.  It was nice and savory.  A good starter, but I'd save the extra room for your main course - you'll need it. Watermelon sweet tea:  GOOD.  It's watermelon.  It's sweet.  It's tea.  'Nuff said. Potato Hash:  EXCELLENT.  I'm one of those rare people that don't really care for potatoes - not mashed, not fried, not baked.  But these were amazing.  Hands down the best breakfast potatoes I've ever tasted.

So. It's no secret that I love Soul Food. According to my last roommate, I make some of the best fried chicken and greens around. Whenever I visit my family in the South, I stop at a Cracker Barrel for their catfish breakfast. But I dream about Brenda's. When people come to farmerbrown looking for breakfast during the week, I tell them to go to Brenda's. And Brenda's never lets me or them down. Even with the hour and half long wait on the weekends. It's all worth it. The biscuits are nice, thick, and heavy, ready for jam. The grillades and grits has some of the best spicy gravy around. The shrimp and grits is bangin' - workin' the spice & cheddar angle. And the atmosphere is cozy, once you're in, you never feel rushed and the staff knows how to make sure you have what you need even when you're sitting at the counter with your back to them. So, go into work late on a Monday or Wednesday (they're closed on Tuesdays) and delight in some of the best Southern breakfast you can get in San Fran.

My roomie was raving about this forever, and I finally tried it a few weeks ago.   Simply, this is a filling, rich, yummy brunch, no matter if you order sweet or savory.   I will definitely return.  And people, don't judge this place by the location, okay?  Just don't make eye contact with the weirdo or two staggering around the area, and you'll be fine. *Update*  We went on a Friday (just 2 of us) and were dismayed at the line standing outside and the packed seats within; but we waited 5 mins and got called before all the big groups waiting longer!  It was so great!  I definitely recommend coming here with just one other person; bigger groups might get grumpy waiting in line outside in the TL.

I'm so glad I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, raised by hippie parents who taught me to eat quinoa, tempe, sprouted grain bread and the like.  Had I been born in Louisiana I would have discovered my weakness for fried, fatty, spicy, creamy, etc. much too young and wouldn't have the benefit of knowing better now.  When I need to get it on though, there is Brenda's, and while she may not feed you in the prehistoric, nuts and berries for energy sense, she will feed all your parts that need love too.  Pure food ecstasy.   Beignets are pillowy, chewy, and include a savory, seafood version, which is terrific (it makes my sweet tooth confused when reaching over the chocolate version to have another bite of tangy, spicy fried dough).  Watermelon tea is perfect, refreshing, and makes me disregard the fact that there is not booze available.  My last meal was the red beans and rice with Andouille sausage, which was vibrant and flavorful despite being so simple.  Bites taken from friends Po' Boy and Shrimp and Grits were memorable, and perhaps the best versions of both dishes I've ever tried.  It's a good thing the long waits, and location can be a discouragement to me, otherwise I'd happily become regular.  Right now Brenda's is happily my "Christmas comes but once a year" experience which never disappoints.

Disclaimer: the wait for this place is absolutely the worst. I hesitate to say that a 1.5 hour wait is ever worth it. On the bright side, it looks like Brenda's is annexing the space next door so hopefully more table space is coming soon! The shrimp & cheesy grits special was so great: cheesy, spicy, tomato-y, southern greatness. The beignet flight/sampler plate includes a crawfish, chocolate, and apple beignet and is totally worth it. I would definitely come here again for lunch or dinner. I love southern food and Brenda's does not disappoint!

Loved the place - great vibe, comfort food (hope you are not on a diet), and service.  The chocolate beignet was just to die for, and the grits with pork belly is just so bad for you but so good.  If we are ever at the neighborhood during non-peak hours (we were there at 4 and the place was full), we would definitely go again.

In a nutshell: Food: 4 stars P/C: 4 stars Service: 4 stars (despite the hour wait...) I just love it when the restaurants that you hear so much hype about turns out to be better than or as good as I expected.  I expected it to be hearty, flavorful, and soulful.  I also expected that the wait was going to be freaking long and that the food won't be condoned by the American Heart Asssociation...but hey we don't eat like that everyday! We got there about 1pm on a Saturday (pretty much the worst time to go)...we put our name on the chalkboard, took a long walk to Philz and walked back.  We patiently waited for about 1 hour until we took our seats.  Despite the long wait, I must say that the seating system is really well organized and efficient.  The gentleman that is in charge of the seating does it well and does it with no fuss.  It's just too bad that the restaurant cannot accommodate so much demand. Anyway, we sat down and ordered a couple chicory coffees and the beignet flight right away.  The coffee was rich and spicy.  When the beignets came out, I was in awe by its size, color and the scent (the fresh oil, doughy smell).  the flight contains four flavors - plain, apple, chocolate and crawfish.  I like the plain the best because, I just like things no fuss and simple.  My second favorite was the crawfish - reminded me of the hot pockets but so much better.  The chocolate and the apple ones were okay... The dough I wish were a little less doughy and more fluffy.  But really, I am a novice when it comes to beignets.... I got the beef brisket and grits served with eggs and cream biscuit, and my friend got the crawdish frittatas with grits and biscuits.  The brisket - well seasoned and well flavored.  the grits were creamy, cheesy and buttery (a total heart attack).  The best part was the cream biscuit - so fluffy, aromatic and perfect.  the homemade strawberry compote was pretty awesome to complement the hot biscuits. The service was efficient and friendly, big props to the servers.  Despite having to wait an hour (it's not the restaurant's fault), the service was awesome when we got it. I'd definitely return here to try some of the other goodnesses - shrimp and grits, hangtown fries, omelettes, and dinner items.

My Ratings: Quantity: 5 - Huge portions Quality: 5 - Excellent Price: 4 - Good Location: 3 - Nice Parking: 4 - Street Parking Service: 4 - Great Speed: 2 - Wait is super long.. Overall: Prepare to wait but worth it. My Opinion/Story: I have attempted to eat at Brenda's twice before we actually made it.  Both times was cut short by a very hungry, very cranky husband. Third time, he had no choice because we're meeting friends. So we went on Easter Sunday at 10am, wrote our name down on their chalk board and waited.. and waited... and waited.  An hour later (minimum wait time), we got seated. YEY! Ofcourse we had to get the Beignet Flight (need to try all of them before we actually just order certain ones), got their sweet potato pancake with walnut sauce, shrimp & grits, eggs benedict and the guys got some breakfast dishes not worth mentioning.  All were pretty good, huge portions and well flavored.  We got some coffee and watermelon iced tea too.   The shrimp and grits was very flavorful and one bite of the tomatoes just blows you away. It had different flavors packed in a small tomato.  The eggs benedict was excellent. I'll get that next time.  YES, I plan to go again.  The sweet potato pancake is good but really heavy on the stomach and the beignets are good but their crawfish is the best. Would definitely try other dishes next time..

With so many stars, I was expecting a lot.  This is a 3.5...but we cant give half stars. Exec Summary: order every kind of beignet they have....then order more.  skip the rest. The person that answered the phone and the servers were very polite, but sometimes a bit too busy.  Our server had not idea who ordered what....at a table of two. We started off with the oysters.  On quantity, I'd say 6 stars.  Watch out, each oyster is a double serving.  They are cooked just enough, but the toppings were either too much or too little.  The sauce based ones overpowered the oyster flavor.  The non-sauce ones did not stick to the toppings. I don't have a basis to judge fried green tomatoes, so I will leave that out of the review. We moved on to the crawfish beignet.  WOW.  The sauce complimented the crawfish.  A perfect mix.  The delivery method was a bonus. For mains we had the jambalaya special and something not very memorable.  I was expecting a more complex flavor than just plain spicy heat.  It was loaded with lots of quality ingredients, but the complexity wasn't there. The servings are huge, so I had to get a coffee to cut through some grease and make some room.  Eventually, we ordered the beignets.  Piping hot.  Perfect density and chew.  I suggest using a spoon to get some filling out with each bite instead of having it pool at the bottom.

My friend and I picked this brunch stop with the plan to wait it out and catch up in the mean time(having read about the line). Turned out to be a fabulous plan because we had an hour and a half wait, which caught me a little off guard...since I envisioned it being about 45 minutes. But it was Sunday, and it was around the brunching hour, so I'm not entirely surprised. Just be prepared when you come here since it's difficult to gauge how long you're going to be hanging out outside just from the chalkboard list. Definitely hit up Philz Coffee down the block and grab some caffeine to keep you going. The food: buttery, rich, and amazing. As an appetizer we got the normal bignets which were awesome. I ordered the special of the day which was Fried Green Tomato benedict and grits. Everything was fantastic but was verging on a self induced heart attack(rich and buttery and awesome-to repeat myself). My friend ordered the sweet potato pancakes, which also tasted great and came in a huge portion. All in all, Brenda brings a fantastic atmosphere to brunch and feel like fat kid. With watermelon iced to wash it all down.

I nice hidden gem in the tenderloin. Parking is easy to find but it is all metered packing. Come early because the place is small. Shrimp & Grits - First time I ever had grit. Have to say I don't like how it looks but it was pretty darn good which leads to don't judge a book by its cover. Flight of Beignets - It come with one chocolate, one apple and one crawfish filling beignet. The best filling was with crawfish, but the beignet itself was too doughy for my liking.

Grits and craw fish beignets. I was here for brunch and I arrived just in time (10:45-ish)  to snag one of the last tables.  By the time we were seated, the waiting area was booming.  There were people waiting outside, staring in, watching people eat.  Not in a creepy way. Because that's what I would have done. We started with coffee and watermelon iced tea.  Both were tasty.  We shared the craw fish beignets (really savory and filling), cheese grits and biscuits (buttery and creamy) and bananas foster french toast (provided the necessary 250% of your daily sugar intake, in a good way).  All the dishes were well made and hit the spot before heading to Napa for the afternoon. Brenda's is a cute space with good and fresh food.  Service was prompt and efficient.  A great dining experience to take home with me.

I hardly ever stand in line for a restaurant. Not because I get celebrity treatment and am ushered in (although that would be lovely), but because with so many good places around, I tend to eschew the ones that are hyped up enough to have a line out front. But I was with friends, and they wanted to go to Brenda's for brunch, so I said fine. We waited outside for a good 30 minutes, and finally we were seated in a minuscule space, practically on top of the neighboring table. The service was slow (it took quite a while to get coffee), but then the food arrived. And I saw the light. Oh my god, the food was soooo good. I ordered the croque monsieur -- a melty sandwich of ham and cheese deliciousness that cannot be expressed in words. The other dishes I sampled from our friends were also excellent -- the french toast, the banana nut pancakes, the onion tartine -- everything except for the biscuits, which I found to be bland. I'm sure each dish was at least 1,000 calories (if not more) and I really hate waiting in line, so I'm reluctant to go back -- but someday I will return to splurge on more of that phenomenal croque monsieur.

This is my second time going but my first time reviewing. The beignets are outstanding! Damn fine coffee! The service was polite and fast and I was seated well ahead of other patrons because I was eating by myself, which I suppose is a luxury of the lonely but don't come here during peak hours, its a wait list and a half. The decor is cute and simple, the space is very tight and crowded. That said, the bacon and egg tartine was a joke. I've had better on a flight to Denver! Seriously, so pedestrian it made my eyes water. This dish is the kind of food I make a lot better at home. I can't complain too much because it was only $9 but still, really? Where was the flavor? The eggs were fluffy but dense. The french roll was toasted outside of the bacon grease and the bacon was meh. The grits made me want to throw up a little in my mouth, had they added any more butter then I'm not sure what would have killed me first, the clot in my heart or the excessive gagging. I was so confused as to whether to make it savory by adding salt or sweet by adding well, sugar. Needless to say, I only took a few small bites of the grits. damn fine coffee though. They had a sign alerting everyone of their (temporary?) inability to poach eggs so no eggs benedict :( but next time, if there is a next time.

If you have the patients to wait to get into Brenda's, it's definitely worth trying out. The beignets were good.  We had the sampler and I would say my favorite was the crawfish beignet. It was so moist, and I was amazed by how good it was.  I was expecting to like the sweet beignets more than the savory ones.  The Catfish Poboy was great!  They put some type of sauce on it that was out of this world.  It definitely hit the right spot.  The shrimp and grits were good, but they were really greasy.  I hear that if Brenda herself is not making it, then they come out way too greasy.  Oh well, maybe she'll be there the next time I order it.  And the watermelon tea was also great!

1. Yeah, Brendas is located in the Tenderloin. 2. So what, the food it worth it. 3. Get over it, the Tenderloin really is not as bad as people say it is. 4. You try walking in the Tenderloin alone for 30 minutes by yourself... long story, it was for a class assignment. 5. Stop being a pussy cat and get your butt to Brendas. 6. Get the chedder grits with shrimp, tomatoes, and bacon if it is on the "Specials" menus, so amazingly rich, thick, filling, and delicious. 7. Don't forget the four diff. beignets: crawfish, chocolate, apple, and plain. So damn good and artery clogging, the best.

Brenda makes the BEST shrimp dish I've ever had! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… And you know what? I don't even like shrimp. It was so good I ignored my pumpkin pancakes. Crazy, I know! Located in the Tenderloin, Brenda's French Soul food is a tiny restaurant (they're expanding as we speak) that I've had bookmarked for ages. The decor in Brenda's is simple and the atmosphere is relaxing. I've heard the waits here can be ridiculous but since we went on a Thursday, there was no wait for a table.   My wife and I started our dining adventure with an order of Ghirardelli chocolate filled beignets. These big things were crispy on the outside and packed full of decadent hot Ghirardelli chocolate. So good. For our main meals my wife ordered their famous shrimp and grits while I ordered one of their specials of the day, pumpkin gingersnap pancakes. As I stated above, my wife's shrimp and grits was phenomenal. This dish was so flavorful that no matter how I describe it, it won't do it justice. They packed this dish full of plump sauteed shrimps and spicy tomato bacon gravy. Their cheese grits were the some of the best grits I've ever had. We also ordered a southern biscuit to go along with the grits. This biscuit was warm, light and flaky. It was so good it didn't even need any butter, it was great plain. Even though I normally despise shrimp, I couldn't stop eating this dish which was weird because my pumpkin gingersnap pancakes were by far the best pumpkin pancakes I've ever had. They were moist, fluffy and also crunchy because of the crumbled pieces of gingersnap that were inside the pancakes. These cakes were topped with a sweet vanilla cream cheese icing and maple syrup. I still can't believe I ignored these pancakes for as long as I did. They were wonderful but damn, those shrimp and grits were insanely good. To wash down all this food we each got a glass of their watermelon iced tea, which was incredibly refreshing and also refillable, which was awesome. The prices here aren't bad and the service was fantastic. Next time I'm in SF you better believe I'm going to stop by Brenda's again for breakfast. Brenda, you rock.

I thought I'd never say this, but THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE TWO HOUR WAIT! Although it's small inside and rather crowded, this place is a must-visit. I was with a party of five and EVERYthing we ordered was orgasmically good! My roommate took one bite of the sweet potato pancakes, rolled his eyes back into his head, and jokingly groaned that they made him believe in God. Not to be missed: Beignets Watermelon Iced Tea Shrimp & Grits Sweet Potato Pancakes (rich enough to serve as dessert) Croque-Monsieur

Not even a $50 ticket from the parking fairy was going to dampen my mood after my delicious brunch here... The beignets, although a bit doughy, were some of the best I've had (although three to an order is a bit much if you're planning on ordering anything else).  My croque monsieur was as true-to-form in look and taste as one could hope for without spending a grand on a ticket to Paris, although Tartine still wins the battle-royale of this particular french specialty.   The place feels even smaller than my first apartment, so be prepared for a bit of a wait if you're arriving during the prime brunching hours.   Oh...and don't forget to feed the meters...

I was so not expecting to find a place like this in the tenderloin. The walk over certainly brought the local flair, but Brenda's was totally worth braving it. I went with my fiancee and the two of us were seated nearly immediately, though given their layout I could see a larger party taking significantly longer. The wait staff was friendly and on top of everything, and the food was wonderful. The beignets where amazing as was the egg and bacon tartine. The french toast was pretty good, though not as spectacular as I had hoped after the beignets. This is definetly going into the weekly rotation.

*Al Gore Sigh*   How I hate to write this review! For two major reasons: First I will add to the onslaught of customers as they line up for: The Best Breakfast in San Francisco, this in turn may eventually have the owners of Brenda's decide to move to another location -  giving us the potential for another Slanted Door story. Reason two, place does great in a low rent district, then moves to high rent, high prices and looses some of what made it great. Cheddar cheese/garlic/grits and a generous portion of shrimp for $11 and change? Are you kidding me, I had a dining partner go to the counter, drop a cup and then while everyone turned to look I licked the bowl for the last remnants of the stuff. Sweet potato pancakes that I can't compare to others because I don't think anyone else has them,( butter pecan  sauce on top), but if I could, the best someplace else might do is tie. Of course, the plain Beignets came to the table hot, and delicious and they were gone withing moments. The service** is first class, very friendly, kept an eye on the coffee and water, (with a almost full house @ 11AM on a Thursday) and didn't miss a beat! The only thing that you need to be aware of is that the coffee is mixed with chicory and that may not be something that you like, but if you have never had it, you should give it a try. ATTENTION BRENDA'S :          Please, consider an occasional "special" of Fried Grits - pan fried, not deep. Yes I know, it is a pain in the ... but I'm betting you could bring me back to the days when I gorged on them whenever I visited Virgina. While I'm at it, REAL corn meal pancakes too! Just have mercy and email me when you plan to offer them! ** NOTE about service. Most Bay Area residents don't have a clue to what really bad service is. Try a week in NY, everything from Department stores, restaurants to token sales in the subway. Sometimes here in the Bay Area there is service that isn't perfect, or even somewhat indifferent, but you haven't lived through bad service until you hit the Big Apple.

Yes, definitely as good as the reviews say. The wait really is 1hr +. The neighborhood is not so great, so standing outside is not so much fun. If you park on the street, remember to turn your wheels in, otherwise you will get ticketed since it's *technically* steep. Ambiance: crowded but tolerable Food: We ordered: 1) Beignet flight - excellent, especially the savory one with paprika: light, fluffy, flavor-filled. 2) Shrimp and grits - very fresh, tasty shrimp with goey, buttery grits, not exactly a light dish, but you will not be able to stop once you start 3) Sweet potato french toast - heart-warmingly delicious and not very rich or overwhelming 4) Croque Monsier - ok, nothing special 5) Po Boy - excellent Overall, we ate a lot but didn't feel overwhelmed afterwards which I think is a really good indicator for southern food which can contain excessive amounts of butter. Definitely worth the wait. A fun place to go for brunch.

Really good breakfast food. Really. This has to be the best breakfast place I have been to. The food is sophisticated yet prepared from the heart, Southern style (not overly grease though). Beignets are delicious. I don't need to say much else, the rating and review count does justice to this place.

Soooooooooooo tasty! Honestly, some of the best eats ever, especially for breakfast. The kind of food you think about at 3 in the morning, and that I'm to still be thinking about many, many long years from now. Can't wait to go back! The lines are long, but the wait has always been worth it. And the staff are sweet as pie. LOVE the grits, and the eggs benedict atop their flaky biscuits especially.

I'm a boy who likes his lazy brunch. I can safely say that Brenda's is the single best brunch I've eaten. My table of four ordered the beignet flight. God, I love pastry (especially fried). Top marks go to the crawfish beignet, followed by the plain. (But I'm a savory breakfast boy, rest assured the apple and chocolate are certainly to die for). Brenda's serves the BEST biscuits I have ever had. So flaky and buttery, just drives me mad! Imagine my amazement and awe when I discovered my Catfish Benedict special would in fact be served not on an english muffin but on a biscuit. The biscuit/deep-fried catfish/poached egg/spicy Creole hollandaise combo was supreme. I had to just eat my potatoes and stare at this perfect Benedict for about 15 minutes before I could even bite it. Then I bit it. And bit it. And bit it. It was magic. Actual magic. Words can't explain. And in between bites I tasted my friend's Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette with Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Bacon Relish (WHAM BAM! This sucker packed a big punch too!) Also with only one menu item exceeding $10, it's not too pricey, Like I said, words fall short of eating at Brenda's, so just go there, and bear the hour+ wait because it's clearly worth it, and eat the best brunch ever.

Brenda's is hands down, the BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN THE CITY. I've taken person after person here, hyped it up as much as I could, and every single one has left blown away. Everything tastes amazing. From the incredible home-made jam (strawberry is the best!) to the warmest, most flaky biscuit you've ever tried, to the absolutely flooring eggs Benedict (home made hollandaise!), to the watermelon iced tea....I'm drooling as I write. Oh and the beignets......mmmmmm the beignets. Seriously, if you haven't been, you MUST try. Once you do, you'll go back, over and over again. And you can meet Brenda, cooking in the small kitchen in the back! How she produces all that flavor in that kitchen is beyond me.

Favorite brunchery! I can't get enough of the biscuits and real chicory coffee.  The beignets are not the same amazing beignets I grew up with, but they're delicious, especially the catfish.  I like the grits and grillades especially, but everything I've had here was great. I'm not big on lines or cramped dining establishments (I know, WTF am I doing in San Francisco??), so on weekends, we get our food to go.  Biscuits stay good.

I would go through my day with a smile on my face if I could start each morning with a Hangtown Fry, biscuit, & watermelon tea. I first came here a few months ago (Thank you, Yelpers!) and fell in love. Then I dragged my boyfriend with me. He in turn brought in a friend of his and so on and so forth. It's THAT good. You instantly start thinking of who you could share it with! I can't really list what's in the Hangtown Fry, but trust me when I say that it's worth calories. There's even oysters in there! I don't think it's on the menu, but it was written on the side mirror, above the counter. I keep telling myself that I'm going to try something else each time I go in, but it never happens. I'm addicted. Also, the biscuits are thick and soft. It's heavy though. Picking it up was like picking up a rock... a warm, buttery rock I love slathering the jam. Tip: Be there before 10 on weekdays. Be there when they open their doors on the weekends. I tend to go by myself because you get seated faster at the counter if you're by yourself.

Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner with Kev, because he listed it in his favorite 3 restos in the city. And ordered: Crawfish Beignet x2 Oyster Flight Shrimp and Grits BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) Catfish Po' Boy (with slaw) Side Mac and Cheese Watermelon Ice Tea Pinot Noir The oysters, beignet, shrimp and grits, and po' boy were really, really good.  I haven't eaten too much soul food (especially the french kind), but this has definitely ignited a desire to do so.  The rest were decent, but not good enough to reorder.  Even though things were deep fried, the food was neither too greasy nor salty.  I would DEFINITELY go back. Great service and ambiance too - just get here early or it can get packed.  All in, we paid $75 before tip. My absolute fave of the night was the shrimp and grits (creamy, but not too buttery grits, with excellent texture).  The watermelon pickles that came with the po' boy were also super interesting and tasty: crunchy and tangy, they were the perfect foil to the hearty and rich po' boy.  Excellent gourmet soul food... that statement is so SF.

Okay, I'm not a Southerner, and I've never been to New Orleans. I don't get all excited when someone mentions beignets or has a Mardi Gras party, so I had low expectations for Brenda's. I figured the people posting rave reviews were the type I describe above. When I ordered the waitress-recommended shrimp po' boy, as she left the table I had regrets imagining a greasy bready sandwich that would make me feel awful. Not so! I don't recall the last time shrimp tasted so crispy, plump, and meaty. My husband got an oyster-bacon scramble with deliciously creamy grits and a scrumptiously flakey home-made biscuit. It was one of those meals where we were tasting each other's food and after every bite looking wide-eyed at each other with amazement. For those worried about the wait, we got there around 11:45 on a Thursday and got a table for 2 in about 20 minutes. I think the key is to have a small group.

Me: From New Orleans - Born & raised and in search of a delicious, Domilise's-esque oyster poboy. Brenda's takes New Orleans style food and lays down an interesting twist.  Unfortunately for me, I just didn't get the loads of salt in the crawfish beignets, or the lack of concept and flavoring in the scramble, or the southwest aioli all over the oyster poboy. FYI - oyster poboys in New Orleans are not served on hoagie rolls.  Quality of the french bread makes or breaks a poboy in the dirty dirty and the good shit involves a heavenly and spongy oil-based oaf with crust that flakes.  see photo halfway down in link. http://www.nolacuisine.c… Props to Brenda's for giving it a whirl.  Please keep working at it and I will try your oyster poboy again.  PLEASE lay off the salt in those crawfish beignets and do something with that nasty scramble.  Spare the chipotle aioli and replace it with a light layer of butter on the bread, pickles, shredded lettuce, thinly sliced tomato, and lemon on the side. Lastly, WHY THE HELL are New Orleans-style restaurants the only tables in SF without Tabasco sauce?

Today was a po boy day. That's all I ordered here and a watermelon ice tea. I first ordered a shrimp po boy sandwich and when it arrived it was a catfish po boy. After reiterating that I wanted a shrimp po boy it took another 10 minutes to get what I really ordered. The shrimp po boy was OK, it wasn't fantastic like other said, it did contain small shrimps that breading fell off easily. It was smothered it a kind of dressing that closely approximated thousand island. I didn't finished the entire sandwich which had fries and coleslaw that was entirely forgettable. I was still a little hungry so I ordered another oyster po boy which was a lot better than the shrimp po boy(which had the breading that wasn't coated correctly). I thought it was OK, certainly not worth waiting for. I saw the three girls next to me ordered the beignet sampler and I was very surprised at how dry the fillings looked. They certainly didn't look like it was freshly made, more like a bunch of heated up hot pockets that was overcooked in the microwave. I also saw their famous biscuit that basically crumpled as soon as the woman diner touched it, as another yelper stated it their review. I thought this place was OK, however I am just shocked that a not bad place could garnished 1,800 reviews and have people wait 2 hours for it. I really don't know what this bodes for SF dining. I think the food served at East Bay establishments is so much better than what is being served at the city. I guess with the high rent and all the crazy regulations and health tax etc... SF is losing it's edge as leader of dining in the Bay Area. Now the city is where mediocrity reign supreme, and mediocre food is perceived as great food.

3 stars based on the food. If this review was based on the service or comfort I'd give it 2 stars, and if it were based on the wait to get seated...I wouldn't allow a star because i will never wait 2 hours to eat here again. The only reason I decided to wait was because the bday girl wanted to try this place and for just us 3 we waited close to 2 hours. Aside from such annoyances, I want to be fair and will rate this restaurant how i would the food. We ordered the appetizer of 4 sample beignets. They're huge so great for sharing in groups. The plain (traditional) one was best, followed by apple (tasted more like a desert apple pie), craw fish (not a fan of seafood but the spices were pretty good. My friends said this was their favorite and they love seafood sooo if you do you'll probably enjoy it as well) Last was the chocolate beignet which unpleasantly surprised me. The chocolate inside tasted burnt and left a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure if it was a bad batch but after a 2 hour wait its unacceptable for me. Least the others were good enough to compensate. I ordered the gumbo for my entree. Very tasty and gave a nice thorough kick to my mouth with spices. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water a little. It's more filling then it looks and I suggest asking for a side of toast for dipping. I tasted plain grits which didn't impress me however my friend ordered the Shrimp over grits as an entree and those cheese covered grits were much better. The waiter told us they are expanding so when they do and no longer have a 120 minute wait I will probably go again...and update my rating if needed.

Been here twice and both meals have been good. The first time I came here I waited a couple hours because I came at lunch time on a weekend (dumb). The second time I waited 15 minutes (weekday, after lunch rush). I got their catfish po' boy and their fried chicken. Both were delicious. I also tasted their beignets, and they're good, but I've had better. Service is always good. Prices are on the tad $$ side for soul food. Bottom line: Great place to eat every once in awhile, but I'd only come here during off hours.

Hello BRENDA! It's seriously love at first taste. I love finding these awesome places on yelp. You make my stomach happy. Me and my boyfriend came here for our monthly dinner date. Couldn't have been better. The service is great! the waitress was super nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant really made the a unique dining experience. The tables were super close together, we were like 12 inches away from the other table. I got to meet a really interesting married couple from Chicago who were visiting their children in SF. Everyone in the restaurant are all really friendly people. To start off, we got these little Hush puppies. they were really yummy with the sauce that came with it. All that crispy creamy crunchy niceness! For entree, I got the red beans and rice. Which I mistakenly ordered thinking it was the jambalaya. I seriously am not a fan of beans but this was my one and only exception. It was thick creamy and savory. All the flavors like melted in my mouth. all that soul food goodness. The sausages in there were delicious! I'm drooling just writing this review. My boyfriend got the fried chicken. very crispy and moist and juicy!  Can't really say much because i didn't get to eat that much of his chicken. But it must have been good because he devoured it! The watermelon ice tea really wash down all that rich soulful goodness. I would go there just to buy their watermelon iced tea. Overall, Brenda really lived up to all the great reviews on I read on yelp. A great place! The food is really worth your money. The taste is incomparable to any other. One of the best soul food places in SF, hands down.

Enjoyed Brenda's French Soul Food. It was pretty overpriced but the food was good. We ordered the Beignet Flight (Plain, Granny Smith Apple, Chocolate & Crawfish) and each had the Grillades & Grits. The portions were good sized. Most everyone had to go boxes. We felt a bit rushed to order but it is a small place and they are very busy so not a big issue. I would recommend this for a change but it is pretty pricy for what it is. Our brunch for two was about $53 with two cokes each and a tip. You could eat for much less but I would guess the average per person is around $18.

Way overrated but worth a 15 min wait. The highly touted crawfish beignets were just okay.  Mushy texture.  Would've preferred chunks of crawfish. BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) was marginally better imitation of KFC. Red beans and rice was average.  Popeye's is better. The biscuit was good but just par for Church's fried chicken. Shrimp n grits were severely disappointing.  They tasted beefy, yeasty, and overly cheesy.  Nothing like what I've had in the southeast. Gumbo was interesting variation (or deviation).  Interesting meaning, not that good.  It was light and reminded me of a green chili tortilla soup.  Also had a weird purée texture atypical of most gumbo's I've had in Louisiana and elsewhere in the south.

Today, I had the crispy oysters with bacon scram and grits.  This one is heavier and richer than the grillades.  I could just feel the grease weighing heavily after my breakfast.  It was good, tho!   I didn't have to eat another meal until dinner which will be on the healthy side. And, thank goodness for the chicory coffee!  It melted away all that grease!  hahaha!

After bookmarking this place on Yelp! the bf and I finally had the chance to come on Monday morning. Love at first bite!!!  I think this will be my go-to place in the Tenderloin. First off, we got lucky we got here @10:30am and no wait. YIPPEE! Must haves: 1. Coffee with chickory - so yummy and no bitterness. (I love me my coffee, I don't love bad coffee) 2. Chocolate beignets-death by chocolate anyone. We could not even eat all three. One went home to the teenager still sleeping when we left the house. 3. Hangtown Fry-delicious. Kind of like a scramble but firm like an omelette. It had yummy not too small/not too large oysters and a tomato/bacon relish in it. This came with the creamiest butteriest (so what if it's not a word) grits and a yummy fluffy biscuit. 4. Housemade peach jam/preserves. OMG!!! it tasted just like putting peach cobbler on your biscuit. 5. Grillades and grits-this was the BF's food. This was beef cutlets (braised maybe) with a delicious slightly spicy creole gravy. The place is small as everyone says, probably better to come in small groups of not more than 4 people. They have good size portions. I was very full when I left. The prices to me are quite reasonable. The hangtown fry was only $10 and the grillades less than $10. That's no more than going to Mel's or some similar place for breakfast.  A meal for 3 with tip (had to surprise my sleeping teenager with his own hangtown fry since he's been known to eat a couple dozen oysters by himself) and don't forget watermelon tea to go was only about $40. And yes the watermelon tea is quite yummy and refreshing. I was so full though that it probably took me 2 hours to drink it.

You know, I'd be happy if I just came here and got biscuits and grits.  Those two side dishes are just THAT good.   I've never been a fan of grits, but these grits have converted me!  Buttery, cheesy heart attack of a bowl.  And those biscuits.  What can I say?  Flakey, warm, buttery.  Also a heart attack of a biscuit.  And of course I just had to lather on several more slices of butter on top of all the butter in there.  Oh, but it's so worth it.   The sweet homemade strawberry jam is also quite delicious and worth a taste.  You won't be disappointed. Minus one star for 1) the location and 2) the crowds.  Not a fan of the TL.  I'm also very impatient so long waits make me angry.   But don't let the location and crowds stop you from coming here.  It's mmm-mmm-good!

SO GOOD. Why not five stars? I guess I'll start off with the only negative - they ran out of corned hash at 11am!!! Seriously, if its on the special, its all over the website, people rave about it - stock more of it. But other than that small mishap, we ended up only waiting about 20 minutes for a table of three - suffice to say this place is short on seats but makes up for it with blow-your-mind brunch. I'd say go to Mama's for the best traditional type brunch food, but come to Brenda's for a little french/cajun twist on your morning breakfast classics. I had the andouille sausage omelette - I don't know why I never had this before at any other place! The spicy salty flavors of the andouille, the sweet savory flavor of the mushrooms....perfect. The hash was nothing to blink your eyes at, but the best of the rest was the homemade biscuit and the weird berry blended spritzy jam on the table. The biscuit is so perfectly fluffy and buttery, but not so heavy that you wouldn't be able to put jam or butter on it. Overall, the service was surprisingly fast, the dishes were mucho gusto, and the prices were fairly decent (about $11 a person). I only wish they had the corned hash (and they ran out of the catfish etouffee) and maybe expand their seating a bit. Five stars otherwise.

Crawfish beignets. I'm back in LA and I'm still thinking about those crawfish beignets. My omelet was very good as well, but it's a lot of food. Add that to the beignets and I came nowhere close to finishing the plate. You also get a heaping serving or potatoes and a gigantic biscuit. To use the restroom, you actually have to walk through the kitchen. I would suggest using the restroom after you're done eating to not lose your appetite beforehand. Kitchen was hot, small, and cramped. The wait was an hour and if you're not there when they call your name, you're outta luck!

Came back here a few weeks ago and shared several dishes with my family. This time food was ordered to go. I tried bites of the pulled pork sammy, the fried oyster po-boy, Andouille and Cheddar Omelette, & of course the biscuits! The girl on the phone hooked it up as I requested as much jam as they could spare! It was strawberry again although my husband and I were secretly hoping for the peach preserve (I asked her if they were planning on jarring and selling the stuff and I recall her saying they were planning on it...crossing my fingers...) My dad tried the coffee & chicory but didn't particularly love it. I'm curious if his beverage, along with most breakfast type foods, must be consumed hot/fresh. Considering I had to drive about 15-20 minutes back home from the restaurant, I still found the food to be really delicious. I'd consider (and would recommend) going the to-go route again since we by-passed the crazy long wait.

Oh man.  Man-oh-man.  This place is pretty awesome, but you better be ready to ingest some greasy goodness.  We got here on a Sunday at noon.  Big mistake, next time I will certainly get up earlier because there were literally over 20 people ahead of us.  Considering how tiny the place is, it can take quite awhile for your name to be called. The menu is pretty large and as all the previous reviews have mentioned, the portions are HUGE.  The biscuit was bigger than my fist!  Better yet, it was the size of my fists put together!  The marmalade that came with the biscuit was amazing too!  I got the Hangtown (fried oysters omelet) with grits.  The omelet had enough variation in it to keep you guessing...oyster, scallions, ham, bacon.  Every bite was delish!  The grits...so to be honest, this was the first time I tried grits, but boy am I glad I did.  It's like cream of wheat, but with teethy bits.  There was cheese and I'm sure a ton of cream or butter in there to keep the consistency smooth.   I also tried their pumpkin french toast (YUM!). -1* for how small the place is...and that I felt like keeling over from all the grease intake.  I'd still be back again!

My first visit to Brenda's was for brunch. The "line" was long, but at least you can put your name on the list and wander or stand aside. The beignets were delicious! My favorite one so far is the chocolate; the warm and gooey filling oozing out as you cut into the fried dough, yum. I ordered the Creole Omelette and it was a hearty portion. But one of my favorite parts of the meal was the biscuit! I came back another day to try the shrimp po'boy (adding a biscuit, of course) and I think I found my favorite dish. The shrimp was "crunchy" and the batter was light. The chipotle remoulade sauce definitely brings it all together. Sometimes I wish they would just sell me the shrimp and sauce and ditch the roll entirely. The wait may be long, but it's well worth it. I've returned many times after and plan to visit again in the near future.

Girlfriend brought me here on Sunday for brunch after a night out for birthday celebration. Slightly hungover and starving we decided to head to Branda's. Girlfriend had been raving about this place for awhile. Things to note about Brenda's. 1. There's always a wait so you sign up and put your name on a list. They only call your name once and cross you out so don't stray far. 2. If you are near death for lack of food or drinks there is a KFC/Taco Bell next door. I almost went over to get a taco to tide me over but I resisted. 3. It's in the TL. Whatever not that big a deal but to some it is. I even found parking right in front. It's cramped up in there and you don't go for the decor or ambiance. You go cuz the food is good. So we got the beef cutlets in this sauce with grits and also omlette with potato hash. FINALLY a place that does potato hash that isn't dried out and is seasoned and has flavor. Such an over looked side dish served in masses to people. The omlette was delicious but the thing that was to die for were the biscuits. Wow. Buttery and flakey. Not dry and just really damn good. Next time I'll definitely be getting the biscuits and gravy. Also had the Watermelon sweet tea which was awesome also. The food is pretty damn good here and glad I finally got to check it out. We also tried the beignets which were awesome too. I didn't care for savory one only because of the dusting of spices on the outside. I thought the filling was awesome but the seasoning on the outside made it taste a bit too salty. The others were delicious and decadent. If you do go give yourself some time. Food comes out moderately slow but not terrible but it's a small place and rightfully popular so you end up waiting out side at least half an hour or more. Just accept the wait and go check it out.

Two words:  Crawfish.  Beignets. Either word on its own is already great.  Put together?  Epic awesomeness.  And covered with Old Bay seasoning and slices of green onion and then deep fried?  Good lord, I am in heaven.   [Side note: why does no one in San Francisco know what Old Bay seasoning is?] Brenda's is the place I take people to when they visit me.  I found out about in on my second day in San Francisco, and after going for my first time several months later with one of my cousins (and subsequently ordering enough food for four people between the two of us), I was in love.   So when my brother was in town last week on his spring break, I took him to Brenda's.  Three crawfish beignets, one egg and bacon tartine,  one bowl of creamy grits and one flakey biscuit later, we were stuffed and completely happy.  The beignets were hot and savory (note: my saliva glands are going a bit crazy right now), the bacon in the tartine had just the perfect amount of crunch to pair with the squishy softness of the egg, and the grits were creamy and buttery in their deliciousness.  The biscuit was amazingly flakey.   How does Brenda do it?  I went home once, inspired by her biscuits, to make my own.  Utter failure.  Now I keep going back for more, the greedy masochist in me wanting to savor the perfection that I somehow cannot achieve. Yet.  I keep trying.  And failing.   On 7x7's list of 100 Things to Eat in SF Before You Die, Brenda's shrimp po' boy is recommended.  I have to respectfully disagree with this.  Brenda's crawfish beignets trump the po' boy ANY day.   Not to say that the shrimp po' boy wasn't delicious.  It was.   The crawfish beignets are just better. PS-- I know there is always a huge wait for seats, especially on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, but if you're okay with not sitting in the restaurant, which has just enough seating for ~25 people, I would recommend you call ahead by 15-20 minutes and just pick up your food to go. :D  It's just as tasty and without the hour-long wait!

If you do anything, get the crawfish beignet. It is so original and tasty and amazing. The beignet gives my review an extra star. Seriously. Otherwise, I've got to say, I was not in love with this brunch experience. The space is small and cute, but the service was nothing to write home about. I appreciated that while it was small it didn't feel totally cramped. The speed with which the food came out was not terribly rushed despite the crowd outside. Nonetheless, it wasn't very personal feeling, not very southern. I'd also recommend NOT getting the veggie omelette. It was a bit watery and unexciting. On the other hand, my boyfriend's Andouille and Cheddar Omelette was flavorful. Sadly, the grits did not blow my socks off, but the biscuit was moist and buttery. I recommend crumbling up the biscuit and putting it inside the grits.

The Beignets are over-rated.  The dough is too thick, not pillowy enough.  Yes, the "crawfish" was savory and worth a try and the chocolate one has nice chocolate inside.  Once they cool, the crust is very hard.  I had to dunk it into my coffee.  The Egg and Bacon Tartine with crispy bacon, scrambled egg, Gruyère and delicious tomato-bacon relish on toasted French roll and hash was very good.  I love the place inside.  It seems like you are transferred to another place, away from SF.  If you miss New Orleans, this place will do.  Service is excellent.

There's some places that are worth the wait and there are some that you should really pass up for another spot. Brenda's is the former. If there's a wait...wait! But if you have a party of 6, this isn't the first place I'd recommend. Tiny doesn't do Brenda's justice. Be prepared to be bumped and nudged while waitresses manage to squeeze by tables to serve the bar patrons and fit three chairs at a two top. But the portions definitely defy the space they're served in. Don't pass up a chance at some sweet tea and a shrimp po'boy. While eating the gumbo you forget you're crammed into a space with 45 of your closest stranger friends. Enjoy the food. Revel in the tiny space. But most of all, rejoice that such a great spot has remained in it's original Tenderloin location so long and hasn't moved to larger and greener pastures. It's worth a trip down Larkin to try some great beignets!

I recently went here with my love early one cold rainy San Francisco morning. We patiently waited in our car a block away waiting for 8:10 to strike, the restaurant opens at 8 am but we decided to give this place some extra time to get ready and for us to not be the first there, silly us. By the time we parked in front, the store was already packed and had many couples and families waiting for a table in the small area. Luckily since it was just me and my love, we got seats fast. The waiter was quick at giving us the menus, telling us the specials and asking for what we wanted to drink. We looked at the menu and ended up ordering the infamous beignet flight, a plate consisting of four beignets (plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish), pumpkin pancakes and gumbo. I love love loved the beignet flight. It was crunchy and fluffy and warm and delicious. I really can't write about how amazing this is, you just have to try it. We ate it all from plain to chocolate to apple to crawfish but I recommend you not doing it in that order. My hubby and I ended up getting full off the beignets alone, those bad boys are pretty big! I would say try the plain just so you know how amazing they are then the crawfish. Leave the other two for the end. We ate the chocolate before the apple and crawfish and it was kinda weird eating chocolate before gumbo. The gumbo was pretty good, definitely not my favorite but was tasty and filling. The pumpkin pancakes were pretty good as well, I recommend it to all the pumpkin lovers out there. What made it so good was the vanilla  buttercream.  There are also some other pancakes that sound delicious, the homemade granola ones. Yumm! 4 Stars to this wonderful place that I will surely come back to in the near future =]

This is the first place I went to when I went with a friend on a trip to SF. I think we originally planned on a chicken and waffles place because I've yet to try it, but that restaurant is only open during dinner time on weekdays, so this was our second choice. After much deliberation (mainly due to my indecisiveness), we decided on; 1. beignet flight - I know that for most reviews, everyone was saying that it was quite fluffy, but for me... it was a mix of fluffy and dense. i think the granny apple one could have been a tad sweeter, and wasn't much of a fan of the plain one... too much of just the dough for me. I also didn't dig the chocolate one too much (I think that Ghiradelli is just too rich for me). The crawfish one was pretty amazing, though a bit salty for my friend and I. 2. Andouille & cheddar omelet - this one was a bunch of awesome. so were the potatoes. I had to eat my portion with some ketchup and it was amazing. I think I would have liked the potatoes even more with a hint of garlic. jeeze... i love garlic. Definitely looking forward to trying it again and eating grits for the first time. My friend and I sat between two other patrons that were really amused with us because of how we were analyzing and breaking down our food. I don't think they ever witnessed people so excited to eat before.

Why am I writing this review? There are 1641 (and counting) previous review on Yelp - mostly complementary. Well, this VERY SMALL restaurant is truly amazing. It's only open from 8 am to 3 pm daily and there is almost always a line waiting to get in. We got lucky; we arrived on a weekday at 11 am and got the last vacant deuce. We started with coffee & watermelon tea and a flight of beignets - plain, chocolate, apple & crayfish. Delicious. We saved two to take home, too. (I had to use the three 2s, didn't I?). Next, cups of Gumbo - as good as the best we've had in New Orleans. Then we split a Shrimp Po'Boy. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly, and the bread & sauce were just right. This place out-New Orleans New Orleans, if you get my drift. It is now a "must return to" place for us in San Francisco. Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars Location - 4 stars Ambiance/Decor - 4 stars When we left, there were twenty people waiting outside...

I came to this joint at about 11:00AM to get a table for 2. Unless you come at a really off-time, you'll probably be waiting at least 20 minutes or so. It's cool how you put your name down to get in the waiting line--there's a huge chalkboard where you take a piece of chalk and draw your name and amount of people in your party. The wait for me was 1 hour long. Was it worth it? I'd say so. I got the Shrimp Po' Boy with Coleslaw, Watermelon Iced Tea, and a Flight of Beignets. The Po' Boy was delicious (this is the gold that made the wait worth it). I would rather have gotten french fries instead of the cole slaw though since the cole slaw was sort of bland. The Watermelon Iced Tea was good, but nothing to brag about. The Flight of Beignets was very tasty. It can be shared among 4 people at most. Keep that in mind if you're going to order it. I like how it's small, homey restaurant. The staff was also very nice. Great gem in SF.

We waited about 1.5hr to be seated here today!! It was totally worth it! They should seriously consider expanding their restaurant! We shared their Beignet Flight- which had a sample of each one.  I really liked the plain with their strawberry jam, the apple cinnamon filling, AND the chocolate one.  The crawfish one was pretty good too...but I'm a sucker for sweets. We also shared a cup of gumbo, it was really authentic and delicious too! My bf had their egg benedict with fried chicken, while I opted for their  andouille and mushroom omelet ( I had the egg white option). The omelet was delicious! A bit heavy on the cheddar, luckily I was able to scrape out a huge chunk of it! Everything we ordered here was delicious.  My bf and I were both so full we walked all the way to Pier 39! haha!

this hole in the wall restaurant is literally around the corner from my job, making it hard to resist during lunch hour. The beignets here are so sweet, warm, and soft! ive tried all of them, but my favorite one is the chocolate (of course). My favorite dish here is the Shrimp and Grits ! The watermelon iced tea is very refreshing! A must try. Make sure you get here early (like 10 AM). The wait is RIDICULOUSLY long. I hear it gets worse on the weekends.

the wait is too long. we went on a sunday morning pretty hung over so the wait didn't help at all. My suggestion will be: come here a lil before 3pm (right before closing) so it's a little less of a wait and hopefully you can make it in before 3pm lol. try the crawfish beignet and freshly made watermelon iced tea. its great! but make sure you don't get too full after the beignet. :)

Disappointing. It was promising walking in - the restaurant has a french/new orleans feel to it with the skylights, etc.  We ordered the Watermelon Ice Tea (highlight), flight of beignets, and the shrimp poboy.  The portions are very big here, and everything was very filling but not very satisfying...a little hard to pinpoint exactly what it was but it just feels like they've been doing this a long time and are on cruise control - not really paying attention to the details.  The beignets were really large - I was expecting smaller...they weren't bad, just too big.  The Poboy was topped with a spicy thousand island dressing...the bread was too bready, the shrimp tasted like it was made in a factory....I mean not bad but not great/fresh, breaded only with a cornmeal batter.  I did like the pickled watermelon rind.  Overall, I agree with the other reviewer - Dottie's was way better. I don't think I'll be returning here....too many great restaurants in SF!

Whoo this place is the kinda place that after a meal makes you want to 1) sit around and do nothing for the rest of your day...or 2) run a marathon to work off that meal. The eggs benedict was mm mmm good! Thick cut ham, this amazing hollandaise sauce that had a kick to it, and eggs....all over the delectable biscuit that everyone raves about. Sounds good? It was. To make my meal EVEN healthier, I got extra hollandaise :P We also got the crawdad beignets, which came with three for 6 bucks. The filling was reaaally tasty. The whole thing was dusted with dry cajun spices, which was good, but was a little salty when eaten with the filling. Also, the beignet dough was a little thicker/doughier than other beignets I've had before. It's kind of necessary tho because the filling is kinda salty. Those things are super filling tho because of that! The grits were creamy and taaasty! The corn bread was ehhh for 3.75. Overall, super good, super filling, super heavy coma-inducing food. I opted for option number 1 after my meal...went home, sat around... zZZzzZzzzZZZzz

I'm a little Johnny come lately on this place, but it is the best breakfast I've had in recent history.  Just when Just For You had stolen my heart, Brenda has come into the picture.  I had identical meals at these two fine establishments (hangtown fry, grits, biscuit), and Brenda wins in all categories (geezus, that biscuit is delicious).  And the homemade preserves are like heaven in a jar. These hundreds of stellar reviews are well warranted.

Amazing food, friendly service and homemade jams! I had the Eggs and Bacon Tartine and shared 2 plain beignets and they were both incredible. The only problem is the somewhat slow wait to get into the restaurant. This area is a bit more colorful than other parts of the Tenderloin, but as long as you keep your eyes peeled you should be fine.

Be prepared to wait cause the line can get long!  It's all worth it though.  My friends and I stood outside Brenda's waiting for our names to be called for a little over 30 minutes.  The food is freakin' delicious!! My husband had the French toast and I had the omelette.  The portions are impossible to eat by just one person but that's exactly how it should be!   Our waitress was completely efficient. Weaving in and out of other customers while balancing drinks and food. She was awesome. The place is tiny so that's why I'm warning you of the wait.  The restaurant itself is crowded so if you're scared to be in tightly packed places I would suggest you go somewhere else.  If you're able to be patient with the time spent waiting for a table as well as patient with the person who's practically sitting up against you because of the confined space, you're going to really like it! I can't wait to go back!

The food is really outstanding.  I had some sausage links that I believe they made in house that were incredible.  The grits were also amazing. The service was kind of spotty.  Two of the people we dealt with were very nice, but one server's attitude was pretty much "you can take or leave it, we know we're hot shit." An old couple told her they were ready to order and she seriously said in a sarcastic tone something like, "that's nice to know" and then walked away.  She also acted like we killed her kitten when we asked for change for the parking meter.  A little more Paris than New Orleans I guess.

This place made me look at the TL in a whole new way; before, I thought of trannies and schizophrenics roaming the streets. Now, I think of fluffy biscuits, buttery grits and excellent, unique (a cajun omelette, for example with shrimp & spices)  yet inexpensive food! This place is worthy of a pilgrimage to and will surely become a regular breakfast location for me. I ordered their two eggs any way; with it comes hash browns or grits plus a biscuit or toast. I went for two eggs scrambled and added some gruyere, plus the biscuit and grits, with a side of molasses ham for an extra $2...the total for that? Less than $9. A bottomless cup of deep, rich coffee was $2.25. This was the best bunch I have ever had in the city and ended up costing about half what I paid at Elite Cafe while managing to be infinitely better. The biscuits at Brenda's were the best I've ever had in my life - fluffy and very rich, yet surprisingly not at all heavy. Next time, I won't get the extra ham, which wasn't that good actually; the servings sizes are extremely healthy and I could've easily shared a breakfast. In fact, I would suggest sharing a main dish and then ordering a couple beignets - I saw someone at the next table over savoring her chocolate one and it looked to die for.

** The eggs benedict dishes are only offered on the weekends ** The crawfish beignet is excellent (see my photo of the beignet flight): just the right consistency for the filling, and just the right amount of spice inside and out without being too hot.  But, I was disappointed by the plain beignet; it should have a hollow air pocket inside of it, but this one was dense and leaden.  Even the lame beignets at Cafe Brioche in Palo Alto are better. (The best beignets I've had are from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, and Lucile's Cafe in Boulder, CO) I also had the Hangtown fry (See my photo): The fried oysters go well with the scrambled eggs and ham.  The biscuit is fantastic.  But I don't like the grits: they are not as "gritty" as the ones I've had in New Orleans; they are too gloopy (I ate there at 2:30, maybe by then the grits were overcooked). I think the Sweet Watermelon Tea is a bit over-rated.  It's OK, but I don't think it's quite as good as the watermelon fresca that you get at Mexican restaurants.

The good: BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER! I have had a lot of french toast in my day but this is above and beyond the best I have ever tasted. I wanted to inject the butter pecan syrup directly into my veins. I also had some of my mom's sweet potato pancakes which were also amazing. I didn't have the beignets but they looked huge and delicious. The bad: not much room to wait for your table inside - which sucked because it was like 40 degrees outside The ugly: the wait was FOREVER. We came on a weekday morning at a reasonable hour and still waited like 45 minutes. At least the food was worth it!!

I was summoned to appear at the San Francisco Superior Courthouse few weeks ago.  While the judge, attorneys, plaintiff and defendant were discussing how to proceed with the case, over 50 jury duty folks were waiting in the assembly room to see if we'd be called in for jury service.  After about 2 hours of waiting, we were allowed a 30 min. break.  I took advantage of the time by walking up to Brenda's to order a flight of beignets. The flight of beignets consists of a Plain, Chocolate (filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate), Granny Smith Apple (filled with what else...apple and cinnamon honey butter), and Crawfish (spiced with cayenne, scallions and cheddar).  I enjoyed the flight and  would totally get them again.  I think my favorite was the Crawfish because at the moment I was craving for something salty.  The Granny Smith Apple reminded me more of a thick doughnut with apple filling.  I wasn't really impressed with that beignet.  Chocolate...who doesn't like chocolate!  Need I say more. I'll definitely be returning to try the entres.  The place is really tiny and cramped.  I think I saw only 6 tables.  Also, It really didn't appear to be wheelchair accessible.

Shrimp and grits, shrimp and grits, oh how I love me some shrimp and grits! It's places like this that make eating out the treat it should be. The location is small, the line is long, but the wait is worth it. Normally when I find a dish as expertly pleasing as the shrimp and grits, I venture a bit with the menu then likely return and make it my go-to. I have a feeling that Brenda's is one of those 'close your eyes, point, and be happily surprised' restaurants where I'll be free to venture without the desire to focus on any given plate. Thanks Brenda for being a 5iver in my SF travels! Oh, and my father always told me that the journey is more important than the destination. Using the restroom here is kind of like that. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean.

The biscuits and the jam are 5+ stars. The rest of the food is quite good, too. The service is as good as you could expect for a place that is so chronically swamped with guests. Watching the hostess try and keep cool under the incessant barrage of questions and the press of people trying to squeeze into the waiting area is laudable. That's the hitch of going to Brenda's: you will have to wait a looong time. So be prepared, put your name on the board, go for a short walk, and accept that it will be worth it. If you're one of those hypoglycemic people, then manage yourself and bring a snack. The watermelon tea, imo, is a weak item on the menu. Excessively sweet.

Let's start w our waitress, she began and ended w 5 stars! We wanted the entire experience. So we started w All of the appetizers. 1- the crawfish benits. We're quite different the coated seasonings on the outside were done way pass temp cool down. The kitchen also likes the use of microwaves. It's apparent when your surface is blazing hot and core is cool to touch. Entrees sweet potato dumplings fillings placed in Asian store brought dumpling paper. And canned corn what a disappointment. Small plate warning! Shrimp and grits never claim to be a perfectionist on the art of grits but here is a cant fail receipe Brenda staff take note grits, half half or whipping cream  real butter unsalted then half water. Boil whipp stir stir stir cream solid white won't stick or clump. Don't just expect any and every customer to like as is food. And side note kitchen staff can only cook what you yourself teach them in your method has nothing to do w them being Hispanic. Back to the ahem food. MacNChz is a beishamel flour sauce thick clumpy, chicken fried over flour egg battered dry burned. Scorched. The watermelon sweet tea try straining before serving. Gumbo was a spot in dish recipe done in bulk great adaptation. Yams cut raw in syrup no tenderness to be found tasted like raw veggies. As for the remainder all of the desserts and we tried them all. The bread pudding no way Jose canned cherries, ( reaction aka prunes), Benetton trio bread cold bread canned pie filling, with this she may want to invest in teaching the art it's all in fuming and temperature. This is notable why sf never gets the food accolades it needs for local places. After the opening it simple falls thru on performance!

Oh my! This place is a complete treat! The food is absolutely delicious. I tried the veggie omelet with the potatoes and buttermilk biscuit. Woweewa! Divine. The potatoes were a show stopper. Everyone in my dining party enjoyed those taters. The biscuit was awesome with the home made jam on the table. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The wait time can be quite long, so be prepared. I took a fellow yelper's advice and put my name on the list and then headed to phillz around the corner for a coffee. I will be back to try those beignets!!!! You can count on that. Way too full with the meal to even consider eating them this time.

ALERT! Hipster Brunch Place in the Tenderloin - - I recommend getting here early as the wait could be pretty long! Highly recommend the Beignets - I just got the plain one  - but they were so so good - light and fluffy  and not too doughy! Coffee  is incredibly delicious  - The Chef buys the beans from a local farm in Guatemala and brews it DARK - yum! Omelets were deli sh - esp the Sausage and Cheddar Cheese  - with a biscuit and grits on the side - cant go wrong with this one. Only complain (thus the 4 stars) was the server seemed to have forgotten our order since folks who were seated after us started eating before us - I understand that the kitchen is slammed  -- nothing like waiting in line for 30 minutes and being forgotten after you order! - get it together. So many other things to try out here -- like their fried Po boy sandwich/pulled pork specials, etc - I am def coming back for more! Love that another Filipino chef is shining! :)

This place is fast and friendly. I went with a girlfriend on a gorgeous Sunday, and was ready to give up when I saw the group of folks waiting outside.  But we were seated within 25 minutes, and enjoying our beignets within 35.  My friend also had the brie salad, which was nice, but the chocolate and apple cinnamon beignets are where it's at.   Prices were very fair, and I was pleasantly surprised to find such pleasant service in such a hip joint.

My god this place was packed! The place is tiny also (probably smaller than Posh Spice's closet). The line for a 2 top was 7 deep (and took about 40 minutes or so), and parking is OK. Parking in the area is expensive (6 minutes for a quarter!?!!? To make things worse, I got a $50 parking ticket....) The food was tasty when we got it (the highlights being the crayfish beignets), but honestly, I didn't think it was anything to write home about. I only tried one thing on the menu, but the catfish po-boy I saw my neighbors have looked bland and could have been served at a cafeteria and at $10 bucks, it didn't seem very appealing. I had the the bacon and egg tartine and it was OK. Again, nothing special. Brenda's is definitely a place to check out, but I think its a little over-rated.

So, I know Brenda.  And I am good friends with the "head of house" aka Libby.  And at least one member of the waitstaff (the hottie boy's named Ethan).   I love them dearly, and now I have disclosed. Finally, after months of thinking about it, I got to eat here!  Since I no longer call San Francisco home, I felt compelled to try way more food than one single person could hope to consume in one sitting.  The crawfish beignets ($6 for 3 large pillows of melty joy) are a must.   They are interesting and surprising, dusted with a mixture of spices that were excellently blended.  I almost ate all of them, despite having also ordered a fried shrimp po'boy ($9.25- and it was perfect).  I also had a nip of the gumbo, which kicked some taste-bud ass.  Yummmmmm. My only regret is that I don't have time to go again.

Popped in here on Sunday as I was starving and the reviews were very good. It was about a half hour wait for a seat when I got there at 1.30pm, not bad really. You sign your name and the number in your party on a sheet on the door and get called in when space is available. It is a small place but the tables are well spaced so it doesn't feel cramped. As for the menu, it's great. A nice selection covering the brunch standards and a few (very) specials. Service was quick and friendly and while the tea was a bit poor (boiling water on the bag, not bag on the side please) that's to be expected. I had the andouille sausage and cheddar omelette, with potatoes and toast, and very nice it was too. There was a fair amount of grease in the centre but that's to be expected with a cheesy omelette and the scallions and mushrooms were cooked well. Nice potatoes too. But the piece de resistance came with the toast. The place makes its own strawberry and cinnamon jam and it's just stellar. Usually I'm too full to finish the toast with a good sized brunch but I had to have more of this jam. Hell, if I could have got away with it I'd have been scoffing the stuff direct from the pot emitting small whimpers of pleasure. Anyway, this place is an almost unalloyed pleasure and I will certainly be back.

Cliffs: Great creole french soul food in a shitty location. Lines out the door sometimes as the place is small. Great place in a shitty location. Its a nice little hole in the wall that serves excellent "creole" / "soul food"? I hope I'm classifying this correctly. I've been here many times for breakfast, lunch, brunch. Service: Always friendly and excellent, although the place is small the wait can be annoying. I recommend calling ahead or putting your name on the list and then going somewhere else. Or coming during off hours. Gumbo: Great flavor seems like it took them forever to get the flavor Breakfast: I had grillades....something? Breaded beef and some kind of sauce with eggs and home fries. Excellent Begeinets(sp?): Freaking excellent, might want to come here for just those and coffee.

I don't usually venture to the Civic Center area for eats, but luckily a friend who works in the state government building decided on this spot for a quick lunch getaway. We got there a little early, around 11:30 or so, but there was already a (short) line for space. By the time we left, in the midst of the lunch rush, the wait was quite sizeable, so come early or be prepared to wait. I settled on scrambled eggs with oyster and bacon as well as biscuits and grits as my sides (you get a choice of several options luckily). Everything I had tasted fantastic, it's been awhile since I had oyster but now I realized I needed to have it more often. The biscuits were nice and fluffy and then grits were thick enough that I could get portions with a fork! The right consistency they needed to be. Cajun food should leave you with that feeling like you shouldn't have eaten it, but you're glad you did. That's what I had when I left. So good it hurts! If I'm ever in need of a southern fix in the city, I know where to stop by.

We logged our party's name on the waitlist outside and the staffperson was just supposed to let us know when our table was ready. Simple as that, right? After two and half hours of waiting, I learned that it wasn't so simple at this place. As a first timer, I've been warned about the wait for this restaurant and I was fine with that. Also, the food served at Brenda's gots bay area LOVE as you can tell from the yelp reviews. But when the host missed our party's name and granted the next party of 5 a table, I had to give out a "hell no" after 2 hours of waiting. Supposedly, that waiter/host also missed other waiting parties on that list... Brutal. I like to judge on food instead of service on restaurant reviews which explains the 4 stars but this experience left a burn like what I got on my face for waiting outside in the wind

Walking towards the not so pretty area of the Tenderloin, we arrived at this place and knew right away that it was gonna be good after seeing 6-7 people waiting in line. We waited half an hour which was well worth as we bit into our chocolate beignets. We each had one full beignet and saved the last one of the three as a desert to share. I had two eggs with sausage and grits and she had a veggie omelet with potatoes. So we had best of both worlds. The sausage was spicy and tangy and the grits were cooked to form a nice porridge. The omelet was light and tasty with vegetables cooked perfectly. It was soul food at perfection. As we were halfway through our breakfast, the lunch crowd started showing up and the wait list went up to 20 or so people. If it wasn't our first day in SF, we could have stayed and have had lunch as well. Every town needs a place like Brenda's where you can have good soul food at reasonable prices and in a totally laid-back comfortable environment.

Despite the fact that I do venture around to numerous excellent food establishments, I blame my sheer laziness for the lack of reviews on Yelp. But, sometimes you just come across a place that blows your mind, and Brenda's is one of them. I've been here a few times now, and yes, the wait can be quite exasperating when you're starving, but I have to admit it's worth it. I'm not sure if they've received their liquor license yet, but if they haven't, take advantage and take a bottle of champagne to enjoy Mimosas without a corking fee. Must haves: -Chocolate beignets -Gumbo -Regular pancakes -Eggs benedict (I tried it with crawfish, sounded weird, tasted like unicorns and rainbows)

Watermelon iced tea was so yummy!  I could drink that all day and night. The wait was long (as it is with most brunch places in SF) and the seating was cramped (again in SF) but the food was filling and good. I saw the beignet flight and my friend and I had to get it.  It was good for the most part but if your first beignet experience is as a teenager at Cafe du Monde, no other beignet can compare. Definitely try this place out.  We were so stuffed by the end of our meal we had trouble getting to our cars.

I've never tried "French" soul food before and the ratings were good so I decided to give it a go. I ordered gumbo and crawfish beignets. It was good but not like...WOW; which is kind of what I was expecting after reading a few reviews. Honestly, my mom's gumbo is WAYYY better (can I put any more emphasis on WAY ? ).......and I'm not just saying that because she's my mom. I'm saying it because she's southern and she knows what she's doing when it comes to soul food.

OMG!  I found another breakfast place that I LOVE!  It's so good that I visited two days in a row.  The breakfast food is very good. I tried the crawfish beignet, which sounds possibly gross, but was spectacular.  It was spicy and tasty.  Instead of sugar, it was sprinkled with a spicy Cajun seasoning. The granola pancakes were very filling and made me believe I was eating healthy pancakes :-)  The anduille and cheese omelet has just the right level of spiciness and the biscuits... so creamy and flaky...must eat another biscuit soon.  The coffee's good, I love their cafe au lait.  The waitress came by with one carafe of coffee and one with milk, very yummy. The place is small, we ended up sharing a table with two other people.  The size of the restaurant makes Dottie's look like a palace, but good things come to those who wait, and Brenda's is worth the wait. I will have to go back to work my way through the breakfast menu and then move on to the lunch menu.  I have a lot of work to do.

What a great place!!  Small, cozy with good eats.  I had the Oyster Po'Boy which was delicious.  The only thing lacking was a better/larger selection of hot sauce (which I'm addicted to). Also had the chocolate Beignets which were divine.   I'm not big into breakfast but would make a trip back since the breakfast menu looks really good and the reviews have been so positive.

Yes, the "Specials" are quite special! After scouring the menu for a few minutes, I felt the self-inflicted pressure to make a choice about what I wanted for Brunch on a late Monday morning.  Then, just as I was about to make a commitment to the Grillades & Grits (Beef cutlets braised in Creole Gravy, served over grits - w/2 eggs and biscuit) my wandering eye took notice of the mirrored "Specials" board.....there it was: Sweet Potato Pancakes topped with walnuts and brown butter! It truly was one of the best pancakes I've ever had; slightly crispy on the outside, tender an moist on the inside, the brown butter and walnut crunch just partied in my mouth. I also ordered the Sweet Watermelon Tea - reminds me of summers off the coast of North Carolina, refreshing and tasty. Since I was dining with others I also had a chance to try the Marscapone Cheese French Toast and the Beignet Flight, all very good as well. Surprisingly, I liked the Cajun Beignet the best, savory does trump sweet sometimes. Go early as the space is small and the lunch crowd begins to file in at around 11:15. Service is friendly and prompt.  I like the fact that the kitchen is sort of open - I can peer in and see the magic all come together.

I had no expectations other than a friend's recommendation: "It's so good!" Well, that and the menu online. I basically wanted to eat it all. For a place that is right next to KFC, the difference is stark and the atmosphere cozy, like a haven within the not so tender-loin. I think the huge mirror creates an illusion of space that keeps you from feeling claustrophobic. We went on a Wednesday morn and there was no wait, so we didn't have to lurk outside. We ate breakfast there and the beignet platter is a fond memory. I thought they would be bite size samples. No no, they were whole sized beignets, one of each. The chocolate was my favorite but the savory crawfish one was a close second. Oh man, we also ordered breakfast food which seemed daunting at the moment because we were already so full. The creole veg omelette was tasty. A new flavor for me, almost like there was shrimp in it. It came with hash and a biscuit....oh that flaky, warm, buttered just right biscuit, if only I weren't so full, you would have been completely devoured too. Needless to say, I left thinking, "Oh my god, I'm so full. It's difficult to breathe, let alone walk. Even to the car. But the food was sooo good. Hmm, ok. I guess it was worth every bite....When can I go back?"

This place gets 4 stars for the biscuits alone. Next time I come here I'm gonna get a cup of good coffee and two orgasm-biscuits. I came here alone on Wednesday morning at 9 or 9:30. It was not crowded when i arrived, but a few tables filled up (and that really means that the restaurant filled up, since there's only like, 10 tables in this tiny little place) by the time I left. You can make a reservation, but you won't be seated until everyone is there. Eggs: not great. Potatoes: look spicy, but actually not. That's a positive thing, but I'm not that into breakfast potatoes in general, I guess. Ham: sounded great with maple glaze or something, but actually really dry. Biscuits: let me just reiterate: AWESOME. I wish I'd tried the beignets. Overall, the food seemed pretty authentic to me (I'm basing this on childhood experiences of visiting relatives). They also have sweet tea (psyched!)

I love this place.  It's actually been a while since I have gone back but let me tell you the memory of breakfast at Brenda's still lingers with me.   There are three reasons I love this place. 1) The vibe.  Bustling, choatic, cramped, diverse... everything that I love about SF crammed into a small hole in the wall restaurant. 2) The hangtown fry.  Oysters in your omelet? AMAZING. 3) Beignets.  What's breakfast or rather any other meal without Beignets.   I would try going here on a weekday.  The weekends are CRAZY!

Came on a beautiful Friday morning for lunch with a few friends. You can immediately spot the restaurant a block away by the cluster or people waiting outside to get seated. Brenda's is a small establishment that is best suited for small parties of 2 or 3, preferably 2. The staff is friendly and do their best to accommodate all the patrons, both seated and waiting. It can be quite a long wait for your food though... Ordered the following: Beignet Flight (plain, crawfish, chocolate and spiced apple) Po'Boy Fried Shrimp Sandwich Po'Boy Fried Oyster Sandwich Hangtown Fry a bacon and fried oyster scramble with potato hash and a biscuit Sweet Watermelon House Tea Coffee The beignets were delicious. I could eat the chocolate and spiced apple one everyday. They come out freshly baked and oh so warm.  The shrimp and oyster sandwiches were good. I would suggest getting the shrimp over the oyster Po'Boy sandwich. Of course you have to choose the biscuit over the toast. Butter that thing up and top it with some jam and you are good to go. The coffee...that was interesting. Not the best. Everything else was great though!

I loved it!! The "friend-boy" yelped a spot here in SF (we're visiting for the weekend) and saw the enormous amounts of reviews and stars for this place so we decided to try it for ourselves. We are staying with friends that live pretty close by and decided to walk there. Upon approaching our lunch destination, we saw the crowd of people waiting outside and realized there would be a wait. After about 15 to 20 minutes of waiting, we got a table for four in the small and overly crowded restaurant. Behind me was a bar area where you could also sit and eat however, it was so crowded that if I turned just a little more to my right, the girl sitting behind at the bar's behind would be right in my face. That wasn't the most pleasant thing. I do have to say that the food made up for the discomfort of the seating arrangements. I ordered the Croque Monsieur which was basically a grilled ham and cheese sammich... but this sammich was made with Guyere cheese and thinly sliced ham with sourdough bread. The cheese was also melted on the outside of the bread too. The friend-boy ordered the Andouille Sausage omelette served with potato hash. He says it was about average. The sausage is what made the omelette. It was very fresh and savory. The eggs could have been a little better... in terms of fluffyness. The potato has ranked a 9 out of 10 stars in the friend-boy's book. Did we mention that we also tried the beignets?? Those were oh so heavenly. I had the chocolate one... it has Ghiradelli chocolate in it. It was very very good. Just the right amount of chocolate with the beignet. The friend-boy had the plain one. I didn't try it but from what I hear, it was quite delightful and made well. I also tried a piece of the crawfish beignet which was also very savory and flavorful. I enjoyed that one as well. To wash everything down, we had a cup of their watermelon iced tea. That was really good also. It wasn't overly sweet and full of sugar and it wasn't too bland either. It was very refreshing. I thought that at $2.25 a glass, there wouldn't be any refills but... THERE WAS! If you're in the area... you must visit!

A-MA-ZING. My friend and I were visiting the Bay Area, and stumbled upon this gem on a Sunday morning. The wait list to get inside was rather ridiculous (we ended up waiting about 2 hours!), but considering the popularity of the place, the quality of the food, and the small physical size of the restaurant, it made sense. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly; they came back several times to check on us and refill drinks, which I always appreciate. First: the watermelon iced tea. This in and of itself made the two-hour wait worth it. It is SO good, and the refills are free. I could easily have drank my body weight in this stuff. Perfectly sweet, but not cloying or fake tasting. My friend and I split an order of beignets (just the plain ones) to begin. These were the best I've had: they were on par with the famous beignets at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. Nicely done, perfect texture, with an ideal amount of powdered sugar. Love. My friend got some typical breakfast of bacon/eggs/grits with a biscuit, which she said was good (and looked terrific), but since I was here for Southern Soul Food, I went with the cheese grits with shrimp and a tomato remoulade. The entire thing was just amazingly rich, creamy, and delicious. I've never had any cheese grits before or since that was as good. I only wish my stomach had a greater capacity to finish the entire (generous) portion. This is food that was obviously made with love. If I'm ever back in the Bay Area, I'm definitely hitting this place up again, though maybe not at peak brunch time on a weekend. ;)

Thinking about the biscuit with butter and jam right now is literally making my mouth water, easily the best biscuit I have ever had! We started off with the beignet flight, which was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I ordered scrambled egg whites, which were fluffy & delicious and cooked perfectly. My eggs came with the biscuit, which was amazing as I mentioned above and grits, which were the best grits I have ever had (which isn't really saying much, I am not am experienced grits eater). Very small restaurant, I would recommend only going if you have a weekday off work and you get there before 9:30 otherwise you will end up waiting in a ridiculously long line (it might be worth it though). Great southern breakfast food, but warning if you are on a diet, definitely don't eat here!!

Boy, this place can be busy! We went for lunch during the week and out our names on the board outside. We didn't have to wait too long, but wound up at the counter along one wall. Since my companion was pregnant at the time and was having trouble getting comfortable, we had to finagle our way to a table. The waitresses must get all sorts of crazy requests for switching tables, but our waitress was very kind and let us switch to an open table. Being married to a cajun guy, I've had many po' boys and fried seafood over the years. I enjoyed Brenda's shrimp po' boy a lot -- battered deep fried shrimp on a nice baguette dressed with lettuce and mayo. The shrimp were seasoned well and not overcooked. My friend had ordered the apple beignets. Now, when I think of beignets, I think about sitting at Cafe du Monde with a plateful of delicious little fried fluffy pockets of dough drowned in a sea of powdered sugar. I do not think of them filled with stuff. This beignet was not as light and fluffy as I was expecting, and although the apple filling is nice, I just wasn't digging what was essentially a pretty good fruit-filled donut. However, that aside, I would love to come back and try the other yummy options on the menu.

Almost everything I had was good. Crawfish beignet was amazing, the French onion soup was tasty, the ribs were fall off the bone tender, the fried chicken was crispy/juicy. My only gripe would be the mac and cheese...not what I'm used to. It focused more on the cream and not the cheese.

Come here early!  It's busy and the line is out the door in the small little restaurant. We've eaten here a couple of times and froze our butts off waiting outside...but so worth the wait for a taste of this puffed pillows of fried goodness. The beignets are not greasy...they're light an airy.  We always order the flight that gives you a sample of the plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish. Their biscuits are huge!  The french toast with butter pecan is a sweet treat.  The molasses ham is okay.  I never liked grits before...but the way Brenda's serve them is very creamy and buttery.

Worth the long, long weekend wait time.  Get there early if you can. Crawdad begneits?  Yes please!  Unbelievable.   It's a tiny little place with wonderful flavored iced tea (was watermelon when we went, and it was amazing). I'm rarely in the neighborhood, but would definitely go back.

Drool. I waited and hour and a half for brunch at Brenda's and I DON'T CARE! The food is always the best; they have the BEST biscuits, the BEST po'boys, the BEST crawfish beignets, great omelets, and fantastically juiced and sweetened watermelon juice.  Yum. My favorite part of the tiny little restaurant is the single red walled corner in the back.  I don't know why, it's just very subtle, but I always notice it. Go to Brenda's and get the crawfish beignets!  They're my fav.

Almost every Thursday, I come here with my Thursday lunch ladies for some delicious Louisiana cooking. I pretty much order around the fact that if you get a breakfast plate, you can get a biscuit, because the biscuits here are delicious. So is the chicory coffee.   My friends love the watermelon sweet tea, and are more adventurous with their orders, getting the croque monsieur, the pot pies, and the po boys. The french fries that I steal off their plates are usually super delicious: thin, a little crispy, and with just the right amount of salt.   Really, I come for the biscuits. And it's always worth the wait.

You know how once in a blue moon you are in the presence of greatness? Like say, standing in front of Picasso's Guernica at the Museo Reina Sophia. Or hearing Willie Nelson sing "My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys" soft and low at The Fillmore. And when you are there, in the moment, you know you are having a life-changing experience. Which brings me to the crawdad beignets at Brenda's. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I will put these beignets right up there with the Gary Danko cheese plate, Humphry Slocombe's salt and pepper ice cream, Goode Company's brisket sandwich, and Ti Couz's seafood salad on my Shit I Dream About Every Night Then Wake Up with My Pillow Covered in Drool list. The outer shell of the beignet is flawless, flawless, I say. Perfect crunch and flavor. When you bite into it, your teeth crackle against the perfect bready goodness and the inner molten spicy goo of crawfish and spices tumble out over your tongue. It is seriously One. Of. The. Best. Fucking. Things. I've. Eaten. I also had the catfish po'boy. Now, normally I shun catfish for the bottom feeders that they are. I grew up in the south and ate enough catfish to give me cancer. But when you're eating Cajun, it's best to go with the po'boy. Much has been made recently of the po'boys at Yats. Yats is a shadowy comparison to Brenda's. Tangy thousand island dressing, cripsy perfectly cooked fish, delightfully crunchy roll. The Wife got the egg and bacon tartine, which she was underwhelmed by (as was I), but the tomato relish on her sandwich was intriguing and tasty. The only misstep on my plate is that the potato "hash" was so salty it was inedible. (And let's face it, "hash" sounds exciting and tempting until they bring it to your table and you realize it's nothing more than the typically gross home fries. When did home fries replace hash browns as America's breakfast potato? Someone should start a revolt.) The place packs. We got there at 9:00 and had to wait for a table. Since when is there a line outside any breakfast place in the city on a Sunday before 10:00? The word has been out on this place for a while, so expect to wait. But those beignets...oh Lord. They will be my new go-to hangover food. My plan is to call them in for take out then send the Wife to go fetch them. Oh, and you'll be tempted to order the sampler beignet platter so that you can try the plain, the apple, and the chocolate. I'm telling you right now, to do so would be a mistake because it would deprive you of additional crawdad beignets. Trust me, the crawdad beignets are all you need to experience. I may need to go back again tomorrow.

Went here just for the beignets and they were awesome!  The place is pretty small but I got the flight of beignets to go and they were 4 humongous beignets for a little over $8.  1 plain and 3 stuffed.  The stuffed beignets were chocolate which was a semi-sweet with the consistency like nutella so it wasn't squirting all over the place.  But better flavor since it was Ghiradelli chocolate.  The apple was like a pie filling with cinnamon and honey butter.  Yum!  And the surpisingly delicious crawfish filled beignet!  It was wrapped in its own little bag since it had spicy seasoning sprinkled on the outside (vs the powdered sugar for the others) and it was delicious!  It was spiced with cayenne and had some scallions and cheddar.  I didn't know if I'd like it but I think that was actually my favorite!  This review has way too many exclamation points!! The cons: Small space, don't know if it was 'cause they were busy but not the friendliest (not mean, but just seemed more like New York service rather than California if you know what I mean). The pros: Great value, great food.  Go here (but not when I go 'cause it's already busy enough)!

I have no children of my own, but I would throw your first born under a bus for a forkful of Brenda's. It's that good. Let's start with the setting. Brenda's is a tiny joint with a rated occupancy of 40 people -- so maybe 10 tables and a handful of counter seats. (If there are two of you, the counter seats face a mirror so you can still "look" at each other in a video-conferencing sort of way). Hardwood floors, simple decor and bathroom through the kitchen. There's great natural light and it feels like you're eating among family. It's intimate, but not in that creepy uncle way. You will likely have to put your name on the list. Get over it. It's a big city and if good food isn't worth waiting for, there's a Jack in the Box just up the road that will have you in and out in 5 minutes. The restaurant would be able to fill seats in a space twice the size, but it's nice to see them focused on pleasing the people they can fit into their Tenderloin abode. First, consider ordering a beignet flight. You'll get four perfectly fried pillows of dough filled and topped with sweet goodness. Except for the savory one which is filled with crawfish and cheddar, and topped with a dusting of Old Bay. It might sound strange, but it totally works and gives your pancreas a rest since the flight doesn't include a syringe of insulin. Follow this with your main breakfast or brunch entree. Someone in the party got the granola pancakes which were deliciously fluffy, and only left me wanting for a little crunch in the granola. My own main was the hangtown fry (on special). It's a fried oyster omelet of sorts with a bowl of grits and the most perfect biscuit you're going to eat. Thought I could slip that one in, but clearly you're paying attention. This is what makes their biscuit better than your grandma's: It's the size of your fist, perfectly buttery and tenderized on the inside with just the right layer of crusty shell. It'll give you resistance as you bite into it and then melt right onto your tongue. As you no doubt know, grits (like the potato) are a vehicle for fat. Your grits will be bathing in butter here and, damnit, you will enjoy it. (I've had the shrimp and grits before and if you see them on the specials board, they're pretty much the best thing ever.) I can't say you won't regret eating here, because well dude, I just don't know. But I can say that regret is unlikely.

Adding a review to a business that already has over a thousand would usually seem like a total waste of my time, but Brenda's is so amazing that I feel the need to shout it from the rooftops, yelp it to the masses, and eat there all the time! I've been hiking up polk for Brenda's amazing breakfast since pretty soon after they first opened.  The wait has certainly gotten longer, and i'm really a wait for food hater, but Brenda's is always well worth it. My favorites are: The hangotwn fry.  A scramble with bacon, oysters and other tasty tidbits. Any of their special pancakes.  I've had the pumpikin and the sweet potato, the sweet potato being so good that my mom declared them the best she'd had in her almost sixty years of pancake consumption. Their biscuits.  Oh my god.  Best biscuit in town, especially when topped with their home-made jam.   Their Po-Boys.  Just went for lunch for the first time yesterday and tried their fried catfish po-boy.  The catfish melted in my mouth, the bread was grilled.  Incredible. Yeah, so obviously, thousands of others are fans as well.  If you haven't been, you're missing out.

I am republishing a letter I received from Emily/ Brenda's sister in-law to remind us they are EXPANDING in 2010!!! Yelp post from 8/09/Libby *As Brenda's partner and part owner of Brenda's, and on the eve of our second year anniversary, I just wanted to put out a public THANK YOU to every yelper that has visited our wee restaurant and taken the time to write a review-be that review full of positivity or critique- over the last two years. Brenda and I are doing our best to make our place comfortable, welcoming, friendly and of course, one of the tastiest places in the city to get your grub on. As many of you have pointed out- the demand to get one of our 28 seats is high, and we've done our best to try and accommodate the crowds that wait. We want you to know that we and our staff are doing everything we possibly can to get you in and fed as quickly as possible. We appreciate those of you who are willing to wait (especially in our neighborhood, which we love despite its', shall we say, eccentricities?) On that note, we WILL BE EXPANDING into the empty laundromat next door to the current space in order to relieve the wait and expand our services. There is much remodeling to be done, so the expansion will take up to 8 months. Please be patient with us and know that we are going to be just as relieved as you are that no one will (hopefully) ever have to wait 2-plus hours again to eat at Brenda's! So again, thank you yelpers for giving us the feedback that makes us a better restaurant. We look forward to serving you (and reading your reviews) in the future!

Place is only ok.  Not worth the 1/2 hour wait in the Tenderloin area with bums harassing you for money. Crawfish beinets - awesome concept, but the ones we had were super fishy taste.  Crawfish should not taste like that. Fried oyster Po-boy - pretty good, good proportion of bread to filling.  But expensive and nothing compared to those served in N'awlins Special of the Day gumbo - same goes for this, not the same flavor as that served in Nawlins, and I like the gumbo that I make at home better. Food: 3 stars Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 (cramped) Overall: 3 stars

Hey! I am the lunch date of Denise K.- the reviewer a few below mine! Yes- a BIT of a wait. Yes- fleeing from an aggressive homeless man, but it's the Tenderloin/Civic Center, so watcudyado? I can attest to the breakfast special my homie had as being some pretty delicious french toast with really delicious blueberries, as I tasted it with fervor. (FERVOR!) My po-boy really was great. It was the right amount of shrimpy meat to bun, and the sauce was really good. It's like, fancy po-boy, so I've had some legit, real southern po-boys (the kind you see on TV) that are really soggy and drippy and running down your arm to your elbow delicious- but this being a nice sit down place, it was tasty, too. They also served it with little pieces of spicy pickled watermelon rind, which I had never tasted before then, and really liked. The watermelon iced tea! Just like everyone says. It's a must! The grumpy waitress was really offering up some LOL stories of her personal life and some lame mean-girls shit talk about a cook that we got to hear because we sat right by the register. The place is super small, so it was great for our little two person outing on the rare warm mid morning- but I probably wouldn't attempt this place with more than 3 people.

Coming here we immediately saw a hungry mob waiting outside. Went through a pretty sketched neighborhood known as the Tenderloin to get there... but oh man was it worth it. The place was really small and cramped. Other then that everything else was perfect The Crawfish Beignets were simply delicious. Never tasted anything hot stuffed like that in my life the Grillade and Grits hit the spot. very filling gogogogogogo

Best catfish po'boy special!  Basically an amazing fish sandwich with fries you'll ever have! I highly recommend it even if you're the type who says,  "I dont like fish." My sister had the French Toast with Pecan Sauce which she seems to enjoy as if it were a dirty little secret. This place is really the tiniest hole in the wall. The wait is crazy during certain hours and days you go, but if you're lucky enough to come at the right time it'll be a delightful time. I assure you, even if you have to wait....it'll be worth the wait as well.

Came here during the wee hours in the morning (for me at least), 8:30am approx. It was a weekday, so there were no lines at all. My friend and I shared the beignets flight. I liked the crawfish, but was not a big fan of the rest. Donut was never my thing. We also shared the Grillades & Grits. Grits is interesting, tolerable, good with gravy. The beef cutlet was okay. Overall it was a new experience. Service was so-so, they weren't the most friendliest, but it was morning after all. I will be back to try their lunch menu.

I thought of giving this place one star, so the rating would drop and the masses would leave and so I could get a table to enjoy the crawfish beignets and hangtown fry and biscuits and well everything else on the menu but alas it's too good. I couldn't do it! But come on people stop coming with groups of 8 the place is tiny!

We walked up Polk Street, trying to follow the promise of an excellent brunch.  One of my friends got a glimmer in his eye and pointed, "There it is!"  I followed the direction of his arm, and gazed at the location, "Taco Bell?"  Upon a second glance I realized it was actually the tiny space with the illegible sign next door, Brenda's French Soul Food. Je ne parlais pas francais, mais je comprends que "French Soul Food" must translate to "More richness than you can handle."  I had tastes of the beignet flight, oyster omelet, eggs benedict, and my order of a croque monsieur.  There was no relief from the cream and richness of each dish and their sides; by the end of the meal I felt overwhelmed. The crawfish beignet stood out as the clear and unique winner from brunch, though overall the beignets were tough.  Second place goes to the eggs benedict, which was served on top of their famous biscuits, giving a distinct and welcome texture difference from standard english muffins.  My croque monsieur was drenched in too much bechamel sauce, and the sourdough was over cooked. I do not have any specific desire to return to Brenda's.

DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY go here if you are on vacation.. take it as a brunch spot the afternoon after a long night of partying.. a plate will cost you about 12 bucks. figure in drinks, tax, and tip.. and a meal for 2 will be about 35 dollars. the house watermelon iced tea ($2.50) is not THAT great. though it is a fun thing to try since its so popular. we ordered off the special board.. if you have  a sweet tooth, try the banana.... banana something.. you will see it. french toast with carmel and bananas whipped cream mmmnnn it was DELICIOUS. best brunch food i've tasted in a long long long long long time. my one  gripe about this place is that the ice melts unusually quick. and no, not because it was a hot day, possibly because they do not put enough ice into whatever it is that needs icing.. does that make sense? i kept having to ask for more ice and every time they only gave me like 3 ice cubes!! also, the place is SUPER tiny, but its cute. though it sucks you keep saying sorry for unintentionally bumping your neighbor every 5 seconds.

I had lunch here on a weekday with a few co-workers. I decided to try one of the specials - the BBQ Chicken Poboy Sandwich which came with fries. The sandwich was good because the chicken was tender. The fries went really well with the sandwich. My lunch companions ordered an oyster poboy sandwich, jambalaya, and the burger. The food looked awesome. The burger disappeared really fast. I would definitely come back here again. It was crowded during lunch and we had to wait for a littel bit. But this place was worth the wait. This place is small and the tables were crammed with little space in-between. People kept bumping into their chairs as they entered and exited the restaurant. But all in all the food was excellent.

This place is good, but I can't say it created an everlasting craving for anything I ordered.  We had the apple bignets, the parfait, biscuits, pancakes, eggs and andouille sausage.   The staff was pleasant and the service was good. Maybe I wasn't hungry after a late night meal at Tomaso's, but I didn't think this place met my expectation which was created by a few of my friends who have raved about this place. I'll have to go back with my brother the next time he's in town since he loves breakfast and has dined at many of the breakfast joints around the city.

Location/Ambiance: Easy to get to and on Sundays there is usually parking right on Polk if you're driving in like me. Its a super small restaurant and their giant mirror on the wall is misleading. I thought it was double the size and when we finally got seated after an hour wait I realized the fire code sign says the max was 40 (it seemed more like 25-30). If you've been to New Orleans this restaurant would fit right in. Very cozy, super casual and welcoming. Service: Our waitress was awesome. They are attentive and provide you with the low down on what really is the best. There really could not be bad service; the place is too tiny to forget someone. Also on a plus note which is completely irrelevant to a regular restaurant service, this little old lady behind us kept asking questions and the staff was super cool and sat down to answer them all for her. A plus in my book. Food: The wait was worth it. My guests and I couldn't decide on which beignet to choose so we got the flight of them. I have to admit I was skeptical about the crawfish with cayenne one and it was lovely. Spicy and crispy with a doughy inside; it was right on par with the others. For our courses I had the andouille and mushroom omelet that came with heaping piles of potatoes and a superb biscuit. Do forgo the toast and stick with the biscuit. We also enjoyed the eggs benedict with molasses ham and the special of the day which was a hash with oysters, sausage and something else that escapes me. Their grits were creamy and tasty and it was all topped off with a café au lait. Value: Great, entrees are between $7-$10, amounts are plentiful and you'll leaved full and happy. Return: Absolutely.

We started with the sampler of beignets; three sweet (plain with powdered sugar, chocolate-filled, and apple filled) and one savory, filled with crawfish. Surprising to me, the crawfish was the clear winner and I could make a full meal on these! Three of shared each other's entrées; a home-town fry with bacon and ham served with cheese grits and a biscuit. I ordered a special of the day; a frittata with crawfish, andouille sausage, and shrimp topped with cheddar cheese (also with grits and a biscuit). A third of us ordered the shrimp po-boy with slaw. A very hot day, we were thrilled with the house-made watermelon ice tea with a hint of basil. We were incredibly impressed with the food, despite the hour wait for a table. The biscuits (with house-made strawberry jam) were monstrously huge. All of the food was ample and after sharing the beignet sampler, I was the lucky duck to be able to take home most of my frittata, a whole biscuit, and almost 2/3rds of the grits -- all of which were greatly appreciated the next day. Now I just have to figure out the best time to go when there isn't a line -- just to get the crawfish beignet!

After reading the reviews we knew we wouldn't be able to wait in the long lines that help make Brenda's famous. We did however take advantage of a rainy Saturday morning and managed to get there before everyone else rolled out of bed. Beignets. I can't even say enough about how AWESOME the Beignets were. They have a sampler plate that let's you get all three varieties but we just choose the plain. They are light, fluffy, and have just the perfect amount of powdered sugar. Delicious! We stuck to a traditional breakfast of eggs, bacon, and potatoes. But it comes with a huge buttermilk biscuit too. They have homemade jam that goes perfectly with that warm biscuit. I'm glad we didn't order anything else, we wouldn't have been able to eat it. The portions are huge. Definitely go there when you are hungry!

Apparently the wait for Brenda's is infamous, so we decided to wake up extra early and start waiting at 7:50a. We got there and there were 3 groups ahead of us, apparently they were thinking the same thing. We sat and ordered our breakfast feast - Beignet sampler, Shrimp and Grits, Hangtown Omelette,  Catfish Benedict and an extra order of Crawfish Beignet. Crawfish Beignets - These fried delights are fricking amazing. They were bigger than I expected and stuffed with yummy crawfish and cheese mixture. The flavor is unbelievably delicious and dusted with a mixture of cayenne and paprika gives it a hint of spice. The other beignets were delicious as well, but if you come, make sure you try the crawfish one. The entrees were just as delicious. All three of them were specials that day, but I think they have them often. The Shrimp and Grits had about 8 pieces of shrimp under a bed of cheesy grits. The Hangtown Omelette had huge pieces of fried oysters that were fried to perfection. It was still very crispy when it got mixed in with the egg. And then there was the Catfish Benedict. Instead of an English muffin, they used their homemade biscuits toped with pieces of fried catfish and a poached egg and a very delicious hollandaise sauce. Everything was beyond what I expected and I will be back for sure when I'm back in the Bay Area.

If someone comes in and starts ordering like they never been here before I usually jump in and say to the waitress "they will have the shrimp and grits...... and some watermelon sweet tea...that will be all thank you" If you don't mind walking through one of the sadder parts of the city to get a good meal, you won't mind the location. The menu is simple, rich, and New Orleans perfection. Once you have had the shrimp and grits at least 3 times, I would recommend trying the andouille omelette, the grillades, and of course the beignets. But it all comes back to those glorious shrimp grits. best breakfast item in the city. period.

The best thing about having Mondays off?Coming to Brenda's and NOT seeing a line! We just walk right in, pick a table (yes we have the option to do so it's so empty), sit, enjoy, and roll our stuffed selves out of there. I usually go for the french toast with the pecan sauce because it is the best, but I've also had the Beignet flight (they were all delicious), hangtown fry (not my cup of tea, but not bad), the etouffee (special), and the banana foster French toast (this would be my favorite, but it's a special). Service is quick. The waiters/waitresses aren't really the stop-and-shoot-the-shit with you type here, but it's ok. I'd rather my food get to me faster. Plus, your so close with the people next to you, you can make convo with them! (:

What a way to kick off my little trip to SF! Since I was staying in a hotel and didn't want to lug any leftovers back, my girlfriend and I just decided to split an entree and sides. Here we go! She orderer the tartine with eggs, bacon and cheese, They do not skimp on the bacon here. The scrambled eggs were nice and creamy. A lot of people tend to overcook eggs and as an egg whore I know. The kicker is that they top it off with some sort of red pepper, tomato relish that really brightens the dish and breaks up the richness of the cheese, eggs and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I ordered a side cream biscuit  with country gravy. Geez. I have a stupid, giddy smile on my face just thinking about those. I don't have the proper words to even articulate JUST how amazing it was. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… As for the fried chicken. This was the juiciest, tastiest chicken breast I've ever had. I've never had chicken from the south but I do know when chicken is good and when it's bad. They must've brined this baby and battered it with sweet love! It was juicy and the spice was perfect. You get the initial kick from the heat but it doesn't linger and ruin the taste. http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

Knowing that this classy joint is busier than Great America on the weekends, my friends opted for a Friday late lunch. This was a GREAT idea because we only waited about 15 minutes. The vibe inside is so casual and cool, you'd think you've landed smack dab in the middle of New Orleans.  The lunch menu is great because it includes some of the popular weekend brunch items. We started with the beignet flight and this is a definite MUST-DO.  The 4 beignets were HUGE and more than enough for our three appetites.  Personal favorites: the chocolate beignet and the savory crawfish beignet. Shortly thereafter our entrees arrived, and let me tell you we were in for a southern afternoon delight.  The shrimp po'boy was literally heaven on a platter.  The sauce that smothered each perfectly fried shrimp titillated the taste buds.  The grillades and grits exceeded expectations.  The meat was so tender and the grits did not have that often gummy consistency.  The cream biscuits were buttery and moist on the inside and golden brown on the outside.   The creole veggie omelette was the only underwhelming dish on the table, and I would not recommend it simply because it seemed to lack that special southern flair.

Update 1/08: It would be a shame to not correct our original review, and compliment the gumbo and beignets - both, in many subsequent visits, have been excellent, the gumbo wonderfully thickened and generous with chicken and sausage, and the beignets tender, tender, tender. Miss would like to mention that the Grillades and Grits are a new favorite - earthy! The Hangtown fry is exquisite (with oysters both perfectly (just) cooked and briny - and bacon).  The Mr. agrees. Of the new restaurant openings in 2007 - only two have made our permanent rotation (not Perbacco, not Spruce, deff. NOT Farina) - and we go *everywhere*, searching for that elusive mix of authenticity and love in the cooking. Brenda's has "it". Although we try to cozy up to Brenda's as often as we can, we hope the ladies don't succumb to the complaints about the size of the space.  We would hate to see the friendly "teaspoon" atmosphere compromised by more tables, more people, more - . Viva La Brenda's! **************************** Such a gem of a place! Our first visit was three days after their opening, and all was as it should be - a delicious lunch and friendly service in a sweet little space. Intrigued and satisfied, we went back the following week for a second look. The cooking is capable and interesting - Creole Soul! -  within the range of breakfast standards and lunch specials. Omelettes with a nice tomato relish, granola pancakes with genuine maple syrup, crisp salads and a killer fried oyster po'boy - the best the Miss has had since New Orleans.  And homemade jam in a little white pot.  And watermelon tea... We felt the gumbo was watery and too shy on the chicken and okra, and the coleslaw limp.  Mr liked the beignets - both plain and chocolate - but Miss thought they had spent time too long in the fryer. The ladies have done well to create a feeling of genuine care in the cooking, the service and the space. On both visits we wanted to linger - order another cup of coffee, open the newspaper or just enjoy the great music.  But the confines are tight, and interest from the neighborhood seems to promise more of a bustle. The space is so small that it's just as well Brenda's isn't open on weekends...

I am madly in love.  There is nothing that I can say, that hasn't already been said... The chocolate beignets are amazing; better than I had in New Orleans (OMG, did I really say that?  Oh, yes I did!!).  The po'boys are perfect:  the bread is crunchy and the deep-fried critters inside are perfectly fried... not too greasy, not too breaded, and not soggy.   The watermelon sweet tea is fantastic, which is probably why EVERY time we order it, it takes forever to show up.  I think they know that, if given the chance, I'd drink them out of bowl and bucket. This is our Thursday lunch place. I suggest coming for lunch AFTER 1:30 if you want to get a seat (and that ensures I still get mine)

Beignet flight? More like beignet fight, when I have to stab fools in the hand with my fork so's they don't steal the savory crawfish deliciousness. It never ceases to amaze me how many people are still ignorant to this place, that a "BUT WHAT'S FRENCH SOUL FOOD IS THAT LIKE MAC N FROG LEGS LOLZ" crowd still somehow exists, despite the nearly 700 yelps. 700!! The menu is super-inventive and changes just enough to be interesting and just not enough to have your favorites frequently available. The grits are the best in the city, the use of oysters in everything changed my life, and if you speak ill of this place I will put a curse on you, NoLA voo-doo style. Even the coffee is bomb, bomb as in now when I have coffee at other breakfast places I cry.

I'm pretty sure that Brenda's doesn't need another 5-star review, but I can honestly say that this place served one of the best brunch meals I've had in a very long time. I went with a friend and after waiting outside for about 45 min,  we were seated (tip: do not go with more than one other person, it's a tiny restaurant and you'll wait well over an hour if you're in a party greater than 2). We were anxious to try pretty much everything on the menu and ended up ordering way too much food for two people. Crawfish & sausage  Beignets 2 orders of gumbo 2 brunch entrees 1 order of grits 1 order of biscuits   Totally satisfied, can't wait to go next Sunday! The verdict: Yes the wait is long but the food makes up for it in a big way. If you love traditional Cajun food Brenda's will not disappoint.

Another fabulous find in the TL.  I've only been here for brunch, but wow was it great.  Although there is always a wait here, it wasn't too bad when we went early(ish) on a Saturday morning (less of a wait than there would have been at Mama's over at Washington Square).  We started out with the plain beignets --evidently I'm a plain person--and they were nice and fluffy and sweet.  I had the french toast--best french toast I've ever had (and my dad, a sweets aficionado, agreed).  The fiance had a really tasty omelet with spicy sausage, which was also really yummy. Comfy, home-style breakfast in the not-so-comfy TL.  Gotta love it though.

You ever have something so good you want to cry? Neither have I. But this place was pretty close, i think. Their beignets were perfectly baked and with a beautiful amount of chocolate filling as you take each bite. The wait kinda reminded me of Dotties. It was about an hour wait, but its worth it. If you ever see a line forming outside of a restaurant then you know its good. Just make sure to put your name on the list as soon as you get there. The grits was probably the best grits I've had anywhere and my sisters cheese grits was even better. My fiancee ordered a sweet potato dish with caramelized onions and pork. Which was a surprise because it was all mixed together. Not what she expected but still Delicious. I also ordered the Poboy with crispy fried shrimp made perfectly with a good amount of french fries which were perfect too. I loved this place, if you don't like the wait then I would suggest going in and ordering to go.

Yum, Yum, and Yum! Make sure you get there early because there will be a line out the door, and they don't seat you unless your whole party is there. Keep in mind we went for brunch around 12:30. As for the drinks: The Bloody Mary's are in pint glasses and the mimosas are champange-a-licious! Food: I got the special which was a seafood fritatta. It came with grits and a biscuit. I got cheese on my grits which made them delicious. The biscuits were very homemade tasting  and fresh. The other items on the menu must have been wonderful because the other 6 people at my table were pretty quiet. I was pleased at how quickly our food came out and the attentiveness of the waitress. Also the prices were great. My whole meal plus mimosa $18...a steal for brunch in SF! I can't wait to go back and try some other items on the menu.

5 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars, 4 stars........I just couldn't make up my mind, but thinking about the parking situation and the long wait. I decided that it's always nice to leave some room for improvement. Although, it is really out of Brenda's control to provide easy parking access and crowd control. There's only street parking or the nearby parking garages. I came here with my boyfriend at 1:30pm on a Sunday and we wait for an hour and 15 minutes for a table of two. The funny thing is, this place has expanded with plenty of seating, that tells you how popular this place is! You walk in and place your name on the big chalk board wall to be on the wait list. You are welcome to order your drinks during the wait. Once you are seated, the waitress takes your order and BOOM, you get served with plates of greatness right in front of your face. I ordered the ever so famous crawfish beignet and the watermelon sweet ice tea. I can't find the right words to describe them, the only word I can think of is "woo-la-la!" The beignet is a baked donut type bakery stuffed with crawfish and some other complimentary ingredients. The crunchy shell with the creamy stuffing is soooo good. They also dust the top with some Cajun powder and that just brings the whole thing to another level. The hint of spice enhances the flavor. Then a sip of the watermelon ice tea refreshes your taste buds and now you're ready to try everything else on the menu. The idea of watermelon with ice tea puzzled me before, but now there is no question that this is THE drink to try at Brenda's. (by the way, they offer unlimited refills) The restaurant is contemporary with touches of historical references. Both sides of the walls are left with exposed untreated concrete, on one side, the wall is covered with a giant mural and the other has many different size and bordered mirrors hung. The ceiling is covered with decorative tin, the divider of the space is painted black to diminish the division to give the space a unison appearance. Between the food, the vibe, the restaurant design, and service, I will return, return, return!!!

This place stayed packed.. we waited an hour and half before getting seated. They don't hold any space for your number of people. If you are a table of 6, and there is a table of 4, they do not wait for others to leave to combine the table for 6, they give that space up and have you wait some more. I am not sure if it was worth the wait time for me... I ordered red beans and rice, it was a lot of food and i didn't eat at the time. When i ate it the next day it was sooooo salty.... however I would go again to give it another try.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! We decided to come here at around 1:45pm on a Thursday, thinking that we could bypass the noontime rush.  Wrong!   We were 5th in line (you sign up on a clipboard by the door), and finally got in at around 2:15pm.  The couple next to us arrived just as we were going in, and only waited a few minutes for a table though, so they were luckier.  The restaurant was still full, full, full until a few minutes before closing. What we ordered: - Beignet flight (one piece each of plain beignet, apple beignet, chocolate beignet, and crawfish beignet) - A cup of gumbo - Fried shrimp poboy for me - BBQ chicken poboy for the hubby (from the specials board) - Sweet watermelon iced tea for me and coffee for the hubby The beignets were delicious - my faves are the plain beignet (sweet) and the crawfish beignet...mmm...so flavorful and savory... The gumbo was yummy!  The combination of chicken, sausage, okra and a bit of rice in a savory, Cajun-spiced broth was just right.  It's actually a meal in a cup, and is quite filling. My hubby kept saying the gumbo tasted "interesting" in a delicious way.  He didn't know it had okra (he usually doesn't like okra) but he kept on eating and eating it...hahaha... I enjoyed my fried shrimp poboy, although the rolls are large (too large for me to bite on) and kinda too tough to slice...so I ended up eating the shrimp with the sweet tomato slices and french fries instead.  No problemo...it was still delicious!  The hubby liked his BBQ chicken poboy as well. I was actually full by the time I was halfway done with the shrimp poboy.  I think we ordered a little bit too much because we got so hungry waiting in line. The sweet watermelon tea is ok...I'm not a big fan of watermelon so I shouldn't have ordered it.  Hubby thought the coffee was a little too strong and had a "bite" at the end, but he liked it anyway. I think when we come back, I'll just order the crawfish beignet with a cup of gumbo and a side of grits, and maybe a plain beignet for dessert.  Sounds like a good meal to me! All the hardworking staff were so friendly.  No one was rude and no one rushed us even thoug the place was really, really full.  They always had a smile on...even the kitchen staff whom I had to squeeze by on my way to the restroom. Yes, about that restroom...I knocked half a star off because I wanted to wash my hands before eating, and the tiny restroom is in the back, through the kitchen.  The door can only be closed with a "hook" lock, and the light kept turning off while I was in there.  Anyway, no harm done. I also knocked another half a star off for the long wait....although I have to say this is one of the very few times that it's actually worth it. We'll be back...hopefully we won't have to wait too long to get to the yummy food next time.  I also hope Brenda can get a bigger place with a nicer restroom!  :-)

Outstanding food, great service, outstanding food, and "wooohooo" as good as it gets! I've only reviewed a few places on Yelp, but had to come back and leave my comments after finding Brendas on Yelp and giving it a try.  Went relatively early on a Sunday morning with a group of six and there was a brief wait.  Within 15 minutes we were seated in a cozy (okay, maybe a bit tight) two table setup towards the back.  The restaurant was crowded and bustling, but the delicacies that were being served at other tables made me realize we had definitely made the right choice.  Wow. Won't bore you with everything we ordered, but suffice to say that it was all outstanding.  The watermelon iced-tea is about what everyone says and while at first thought a little weird the catfish eggs benedict was pretty darn good. A+ in my book and something that I can recommend without hesitation.

Brenda's is well worth the wait. And let me tell you, there is ALWAYS a wait. We came out on a Sunday afternoon, hoping to miss the morning crowds, and waited about 45 minutes, sitting down at 2pm. My pal had the oyster-bacon omelette, while I had the shrimp and goat cheese and both were delish. Portions were huge, so next time we may split:) The chicory coffee is amazing and so is the watermelon tea - IF you are a watermelon fan. This is the real deal folks; real chunks of watermelon and fresh brewed iced tea - super yummy and refreshing. The grits were on the side for both of us and blew us away - so creamy and tasty - much better than any I have had in the past. Check out Brenda's and you will NOT be disappointed. Maybe try and get there early - say 8:15-8:30:) This way you may beat the crowds!!!

This place rules.  I originally found it thru the 7x7 100 things to eat and drink before you die. They recommend the fried shrimp po'boy, which is great, but there's tons of great stuff here. Don't go here if you are on a diet, but go here for some good 'ol southern yummy cookin' like authentic gumbo, shrimp and cheese grits, solid po'boys and the best beignets outside of NOLA. Kinda sucks that the wait is so long on weekends (the place is pretty tiny). It's worth the wait, but find an excuse to go over mid-week.  I made 2 trips here on my recent stint on jury duty down the street in Civic Center.

Brenda's French Soul Food seemed a little over-hyped from the reviews and from friends' word-of-mouth descriptions. The place is small, and they have a large chalkboard to put your name down before seating. My friends and I tried a plethora of the dishes, and we all got the sweet watermelon ice tea. That was amazing. With free refills and a fresh piece of watermelon inside, the drink probably parred with the food. I personally ordered the BFC - three pieces of their fried chicken, slaw, biscuit, and slices of pickled watermelon. I expected a little more from the chicken, being that it's a "house favorite," but it was decent enough. I'm not sure in conjunction with the other dishes, but the pickled watermelon was like a fly ball to left field when matching tastes with everything else. It is something to prepare yourselves for before eating.

First the bad news. 1) Eating brunch here on any given weekend will probably require at least a 30 minute wait. 2) Street parking is pricey.  The street meters in this oh-so-swanky part of town will run you 6 minutes per quarter.  That's $2.50/hr to park in the heart of the Tenderloin!  To add insult to injury, the limit is 1 hour so chances are that you'll need to feed the meter a second time before you've even been seated. Now the good news. The food rocks.  Did I say ROCKS??  Think "Two-Tickets-To-Paradise-for-the-tastiest-poboys,-­beignets,-biscuits-and-cheesy-eggy-things-you'll-­ever-find-on-your-Stairway-To-Heaven!" and you'll start to get the picture.  I waited twice as long to get into Dotties and was half as impressed.  Eating at Brenda's requires patience but the food delivers, the portions are generous, and the price is right.  SF needs more restaurants like Brenda's.

The grits are delicious, the beignets are creative and tasty (I LOVE the chocolate ones...oh, and the apple...they're all good), and they make an excellent biscuit!   So it seems that I'm trying to say this is a great place to get yummy carbohydrates :-) (oh, yeah, their eggs and seafood items are good too.)

Came here for the first time this past weekend and my boyfriend and I made it a point to try this place! Sad to say, it did not meet expectations. The food was average at best, maybe it was because we were so full off the massive beignets. We thought they were mini donuts, but they're huge! There's no way these are appetizers...and they serve 4 of them in one order. So beware! The Catfish Po'Boy was not too bad, but I didn't think it was anything special. The Hangtown Fry is really good though, they put plenty of oysters in there and the biscuits are yummy too. Again, maybe if we weren't so stuffed from the beignets, we would've enjoyed it better. Maybe next time.

So worth the freaking 5 year wait!! I highly recommend the Beignet flight, even though you could probably eat 5 crawfish beignets by yourself! The Beinet's are more dense than the cafe du monde, but these beignets are filled with happiness for your taste buds. I had the shrimp and grits, soooooo cheesy i loved it. the and my sister had the andouille sausage omelette, their potatoes are so damn seasoned well! and of course what would be breakfast if you didn't have a mimosa, so you know . . .i was buzzed and enjoying my breakfast too =) also we brought my 2 month old in as well and although the restaurant has limited elbow room they were still able to accommodate us!! so i loved the food, the atmosphere and the damn service was awesome!! i can't wait to come back and bring my husband!

This place lived up to the hype of previous reviews.I  ate here twice recently while on vacation. The food was excellent as was the service.I  had the banana foster french toast and the andouille sausage and cheddar omelet  Both were excellent. The french toast really stood out for me    I am pretty impatient and hate lines  but the wait time wasn't bad at all. 15 mins one time, seated immediately next time. The price seemed pretty reasonable. Why not 5 stars? The biscuits didn't really impress me, the watermelon ice tea seemed more like watermelon juice and the bathroom situation. The bathroom itself was clean but getting there thru the kitchen was an experience. I kept picture myself getting burned or knocking something down.

I love breakfast/brunch foods and saw all the great reviews of this restaurant so I decided to give it a try. Here are the reviews of the things we ordered: -Chocolate Beignets: I definitely have a sweet tooth so I enjoyed the chocolate beignets. Personally, there was a bit too much chocolate filling though but if you're a chocolate lover, you'll love these. The shell is crunchy and mixes well with the chocolate filling. One order comes with 3 very filling beignets...all for $5! -Buttermilk Pancakes - Two Nice, Big Fluffy Ones: On the menu, they describe these as being "fluffy" and that's definitely a good word for these pancakes. We ordered these plain but I think it would have been better with fruit on top. One order comes with 2 big "fluffy" pancakes and they were delicious! ($7) -Two Eggs Any Way You Like 'Em: We chose the potatoes and biscuit as the sides for this dish. It was the best decision ever! The biscuits are a MUST-HAVE!  They were the best biscuits I've ever had in my life. It's so soft and it literally melts in your mouth. The potatoes were also delicious.  The eggs were also well made. We enjoyed this dish the most! ($6.75) -Sweet Watermelon  Tea: I liked the tea because it wasn't too sweet but still had a great watermelon flavor. There were some mint leaves in it too to add to the taste. ($2.25) Our bill came out to around $22 for 2 people (not including tip). We were overly full and had to pack our 3rd beignet, half of the biscuit (it's THAT good that we didn't want to waste it), our 3rd pancake, and the rest of the potatoes. The restaurant is a bit small with about 5 or 6 tables and seats along the wall. We went around 2pm on a weekday and there was no wait. The service was great and the waitresses are very friendly.  They're also very helpful and will make recommendations if you don't know what to order. Overall, it was a great experience!

Met an old friend here for lunch--a place she had been wanting to try.  I was stoked because of the rave Yelp reviews it has received.  She tried to beat the system by putting our name on the table wait list at 11:20am and went back to work (thinking by the time we met at 12pm we wouldn't even have to wait).  How wrong we were...when we actually met up at 12pm I saw her name already crossed off from the list.  Oh well, we had to wait 30mins after I put my name down. I will give Brenda's four stars for the yummy cup of gumbo that I had and also for the atmosphere the tiny restaurant creates.  It was the tastiest cup of soup I've had in a while and it had a generous amount of goodies (seafood and some spicy sausage--almost chorizo-ish).  However, the rest of the food in my opinion was so-so and I give that a 3-star rating.   Here's the low down: -3 Apple Cinnamon beignets: I'll be completely honest and say that these were nothing like the beignets I had at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  Frankly these sorta reminded me of McDonald's apple pies. :-/ -watermelon house tea: not super tasty just seemed like plain tea infused with a bit of watermelon--nothing real exciting -oyster poboy: the oyster seemed seasoned well, however it would have been nicer with a few more oysters.  I felt like some bites were just bread! -gumbo: see above. My only main complaint was that my cup that had the watermelon iced tea had lipstick marks on it--didn't want to make a stink about it so just put up with it and didn't turn my cup when I drank it. Brenda's is worth checking out if you want to try something unique.  Expect to wait.

I'm a big fan of anything that includes biscuits and oysters so when I read the menu outside of the restaurant that offered a breakfast/brunch dish that had both, I knew it was meant to be. Oh Brenda...you were the first meal I had in SF this past vacay and it was delightful. Yes the wait was a little long and it seemed longer because I was starving, but was it worth the wait? YES. My cousin and I both ordered the watermelon iced tea, yum even though it was sf weather (meaning a chilly 60 degrees which was a surprising delight from the wretched heat in LA). Nice and refreshing and we got free refills (I hate it when they don't give refills in restaurants). Then I ordered the hangtown fry (which included a flaky warm biscuit, omelette with oysters and bacon and hash) and my cousin ordered the shrimp and grits (which she saw someone eating through the window while we were waiting outside- watching them slop up the gooey cheese into their mouths, so disgusting to watch but mesmerizing). The funny thing was the waitress finally brought our food, well mine first and I was so excited I immediately started digging into the biscuit, buttering it up with lots of butter (mmm I love fat) and was shoving it in my mouth when she returns and says she gave me the wrong plate. UM HELLO?? I WAS EATING! Luckily I didn't touch the rest of the plate since I was so busy eating the biscuit that she took the dish back and tried to re-serve it back to the person it was originally intended for and no surprise, that woman refused to eat it (the restaurant is that small- you can see every patron in it and you will notice when the waitress brings you a plate from someone else's table!). Other than that, when I finally did receive my actual food I did officially dig in and it was delish. The omelette was really good, especially the fried oysters, yum! The biscuits were so good that all I needed was a tab of butter, no jam. I think I could have eaten 2 plates of biscuits. The hash were pretty good, nothing amazing but good. My cousin's shrimp and grits were pretty good, nicely seasoned. The relish on the shrimp and bacon was quite tasty and added great flavor to the grits. We were so incredibly stuffed after this meal that we didn't even eat dinner that night...but it was so worth it!

Brenda's truly *is* as good as it gets.   I grew up eating Texas biscuits, and I thought I knew what good biscuits were.  Brenda's blows them out of the water.   The food is spectacular.  The coffee is strong.  The service is superb.  I don't know how the kitchen and waitstaff get the food out so quickly and juggle so many tables full of eager diners, but they do, and with grace. Brenda's gets my highest recommendation.  Just save me some biscuits.

Oh Brenda's. Nothing in the grim streets of the general Tenderloin-ish area brings me as much joy as this restaurant.  Sometimes, I wonder how it is that I can love this restaurant so much. Then, I remember the biscuits.  Oh the biscuits.  They are so perfect.  Spread on a little butter and some of their homemade(?) jam.  Perfection. I first heard about Brenda's from a friend who was trying to pitch to me how great their crawfish beignets were.  I was a bit skeptical about this as I've always thought beignets more on the sweet than the savory side.  When I finally went there, any skepticism vanished.  While the smell of the spices may be overwhelming at first, these beignets are an absolute treat.  I crave them.  In the end, I go to Brenda's for the crawfish beignets and the biscuits.  Everything else is simply gravy.   For a first visit, I would recommend trying the beignet flight.  I am not a big fan of their plain beignet, but the other three are delicious.  I am also a big fan of the Andouille and Cheese Omelet.    Just know that as anything with andouille sausages and cheese tends to be, it's a pretty heavy dish.  I can normally only make it through half.  I've also tried the Grillades and Grits and think that they're pretty solid.  I must say that I wasn't a big fan of the watermelon iced tea the first time I tried it.  I stole some of my mom's when I went earlier today and then understood why everyone loves it.  It's so good.   Here's my thing, though.  I really think that there are items on the menu that are much more deserving of the 7x7 nod than the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy.  Yeah, it's pretty good (albeit a bit on the greasy side), but I think it's overshadowed by the biscuits and the crawfish beignets.   Yeah, the wait can get pretty long, but I think it is worth it in the end.  And, I mean, it's not like you can't sign your name and run to a coffee shop for a while.  Best time to go if you don't want to deal with the wait is around 1:30/2 on a weekday.  That's when I go.

This is the best brunch I have had in my life. As much as I love Bar Tartine, it has now been relegated to the #2 position in my love of brunch places. Luckily for me, my brunch date waited outside starting from the point where I left the South Bay and thus by the time I got there we had a table just as I arrived. Yes the wait is that long, but it is definitely worth it. I basically let the SF dweller order everything for me, because they had been to Brenda's many times before. The portions were big enough to split and too much to finish even. We started with the fried catfish eggs benedict, which was the chalkboard special. O-M-G FRIED CATFISH EGGS BENEDICT with the creole hollandaise sauce which was somewhat spicy. To... die... for! Not to mention the fresh homemade biscuit. It was flakey and wonderful. I also was ordered the watermelon ice tea, which was so brilliant. Fresh watermelon puree in tea. So refreshing and nice. Then we also split the walnut pancakes with maple syrup. Don't get me wrong this was fantastic too, but I'm more of a savory than a sweet person, and the pancakes weren't anything special to the place. Next time I want to try some other selections, but yes, I will be back. I'm just hoping someone *wink* *wink* is willing to wait in line, and order delicious things for me again.

Not 5 stars because of the wait (almost an hour and a half). Tried the watermelon iced tea (good to try, just share with someone), crawfish beignets (pretty good), gumbo (i've had better, but i'm from TX), and oyster scramble.  I thought the scramble was decent, the oysters were HUGE.  Biscuits with homemade jam...even better.  I had a massive case of food envy and almost finished off my friend's shrimp and cheese grits (really delicious). Overall I think this is a once in a lifetime thing you must try, however since the food is so heavy I felt really stuffed and didn't want to look or think about food for the rest of the day.  Maybe I'll go back if there isn't a wait

Mmmm. Ordered the sweet potato pancakes with pecan butter sauce (off the daily specials). My friend got a grits/shrimp dish (also a special) which I had a taste of. Both soo delicious. We split the chocolate beignets (which come in 3). Portions are large, and prices are cheap. My kind of place. Came here on a Thursday afternoon and seating for two was maybe a 10-15 min wait. If you can swing it, weekdays are definitely the way to go since this place is tiny.

Wow, where to begin.  Today was my first actual visit at Brenda's; I've stopped by many times, but the line outside anytime after 8:30 has always deterred me.  Breakfast food usually never impresses me, so when I find a place that does, I'm usually blown away... and I was. This cozy 40 seat little gem would be well worth the wait even on a cold, wet SF morning.  Although I'd love it even more if there were mimosas or cajun bloody marys, you shouldn't be deterred from visiting even if you love a libation with your brunch.  What beverage should you have?  Hands-down, the watermelon iced tea - it's a lovely taste of the south combined with muddled watermelon.  How have I never thought of that on my own? To eat, I started with the Granny Smith apple beignets.  Crispy and doughy oozing with cinnamon butter, perfectly sauteed apples, and love.  After that I had one of today's specials - shrimp & cheese grits with tomato-bacon relish.  Seven jumbo shrimp, perfectly seasoned curled up together under the relish swimming in warm, melty, cheesy goodness.  Every awesome sensation you can get from great food was present... salty, sweet, savory heaven. Not only is the food great, you get a ton of it.  For 20 bucks and change, I had breakfast and at least 1, if not two meals left.  Anyone who knows me knows I don't eat leftovers.  These I will.

This is a serious gem of a french creole brunch spot in the tenderloin of all places. You forget how sketchy the neighborhood is once you step inside, smell the warm butter and crystal sauce, and sit at the white tableclothed benches. The service is top notch: hospitable, knowledgeable, courteous, and sensitive to all needs. While we waited the 45 minutes (which, I am told, is average) we were offered coffee to hold us over. The waiting area indoors is quite small so be prepared to stand outside for the duration. The wait list DOES close after 2pm so don't come close to closing. That said, even though they close at 3, loyal patrons who survived the wait were still seated and treated well past 3 pm. -- In sum: Worth the Wait, but come well before 2pm. The food will have you break every diet vow. The biegnets (lightly fried pastries) stuffed with either crayfish, fruit puree, or chocolate are a highlight. Served 3 at a time, they make a nice appetizer and if you can't finish them, just reheat in the oven. The crawfish one is dusted with cayenne on the outside, but still is not too spicy. -- In sum: order the biegnet flight (3)! We ordered the shrimp and grits. This is not a meal for the lighthearted. The grits are creamy, buttery, and smothered in melted soupy cheddar. This serves as a bed for the shrimp, bacon, and onions in a tomato based sauce. Have not tasted anything comparable in the city yet. Tastes great with the crystal hot sauce on the table. -- In sum: The special dishes are awesome. Get one. Other extras: Coffee is excellent and earthy Strawberry jam on the table is chunky, homemade, and not too sweet Don't be fooled by their restaurant site - the biscuits, while good, are not the stars of the show. The biegnet flight, watermelon iced tea, and most specials are. Vg info: Brunch usually means plenty of vegetarian options like griddle foods (pancakes, waffles) and eggs. However I didn't catch too many vegan options on the menu (vegan Josephine, lunch; fruit plate, side dish). Call ahead to request because they may be able to accommodate. Only a few dishes can be made vegan by excluding dairy/ egg. Menu does not denote gluten-free items so ask your waiter. FYI: The owner just informed us that he is expanding so the new space (a combo of the current space and next door) will house 75 hungry patrons (yay!). They're also going to start serving dinner, and they got their alcohol license so look forward to a mimosa with your brunch come April 2011. I can't wait!

I've been wanting to come here for months! Every time anyone asks where to go for lunch/brunch, I immediately suggest Brenda's. I mean the pictures looked good, the menu looked good and well the Shrimp Po Boy is on the 7x7 list. Sadly, I was disappointed when I was here. Ordered the chocolate beignets. They were good, but not o-m-g good. The dough was too thick, and crunchy. I expected my beignets to be more light and airy. However, the chocolate filling inside was great. I loved that part. Bacon and Egg Tartine was  horrible. I highly don't recommend. There was nothing special about it. I  could have made the whole thing at home. Toast, two slices of thin/soggy bacon, scrambled eggs and this over-salted tomato/sauce/relish thing. The flavors didn't come together at all. It would have been better if instead of a scrambled egg they did a pan-fried egg or even a poached egg. Additionally the side of home fries looked like they were the remains of yesterday's homefries or just scraped from somewhere in the kitchen. No flavor and it just looked unappetizing. Shrimp Po Boy was good. It was really good. It's probably the only thing I suggest you ordering from here. The shrimp was perfectly coated in this light batter, and I would think just flash fry because the shrimp was still succulent. Not over cooked or dry at all. The french bread was nicely buttered and toasted. I did like the sauce they used on the Po Boy. I asked for it on the side so I can control how much I liked. The reason why Brenda's receives a three star and not four is because of the Bacon and Egg Tartine and the service. Horrible. I don't like the fact that they rush you, and that they don't even look happy being there or happy that you're there giving them service. I was there on a weekday too, so I can only imagine how much worse it is on a weekday. There are many other places in the city to go for breakfast/brunch.

If you don't want to wait for lines, order take-out.  Rest assured, you will enjoy each bite of their eggs benedict with catfish or their catfish poboy with grits.  Even though portions are quite generous, don't forget to start or end with a flight of beignets that come in plain, Ghirardelli chocolate, Granny Smith Apple with cinnamon honey butter, and crawfish with cayenne, scallions and cheddar.   Service is fast, friendly, and helpful.  The ambiance and decor are simple and clean with a small area to seat a dozen tables or so.  Parking can be tough on the streets.

I had the eggs ben. with chicken. OMG. First off, had no idea the chicken would be fried and I was quite happy it was because you know fried chicken...Then, the biscuits! I like that the egg was on top of a biscuit instead of a english muffin because it was different. The sauce was great because it was cajun so a little kick to it! The potatoes did not lack flavor at all unlike some breakfast places I have been to. Overall the food was awesome and we came at 1pm last Sunday so we didn't have to wait too long. We also had the chocolate beignet which was to die for! I have lived all over this country and never had biscuits like that before. LOOOOVVEEE this place! Will be coming back.

Maaaaaaaaan.! I was really looking forward to eat at Brenda's since I found out about it. So, I had to plan a trip. I'm from the east bay, but I'm willing to travel, by car, by bus, by train, by plane, by boat, by foot to a try out a new spot. Yup, I guess you could say I'm a food addict (well, to good food at least). Got here on a cool Friday morning (around 9.00AM), it feels so homely here, nice New Orleans-ian style restaurant. Very welcoming :) and it wasn't packed yet, if you get there at 9.30AM, you would have to write your name on the wait list, and patiently wait to be seated.... Yup, 30 minutes makes a difference. The waitress was friendly and nice, easy to talk to and ask questions. Wasn't sure what to order, but we had to order a few dishes to try it out, you know. Beignet flight:: the deliciousness has landed...in my mouth, and then in my tummy. It is delicious!!!!!! There are 4 different kinds-plain, chocolate (Ghirradelli), apple cinnamon, and crawfish. Whew!! And they're so big, even though I split half on all of them, I could barely finish them all, but they were so delicious, so I just kept on eating anyways :-) I loved how light and fluffy they were, not greasy, not heavy, not oily, but just right. Yep, the beignet flight; they were just right; not so heavy but quite light; my taste buds felt like I saw a whole new light.   .....Yes, that was a (semi-lame ode to the beignet flight, but don't judge me. Did I mention it was delicious!) Shrimp and grits--my oh my, my oh my, my oh my. Fantastically delightfully wonderfully fabulous! Grits were creamy, shrimp was tender, the Sharp cheddar was cheese-y (yes, I know it's quite cheesy to describe cheese as cheese-y..hmmph, don't mind me), and the BEST part---the roux had BACON in it!! You could never go wrong with BACON. Bacon, bacon, bacon. Yes I love bacon so much, you know! Now. So far, I thought to myself, I'm gonna rate Brenda's restaurant 5 piping hot stars!! But, alas, a star must be taken off.. sad, eh.? Why? Because I tried the granola pancakes... One word, three letters::::DRY!!!! Very, very, very DRY!! We took a bite and then just stared at it for what felt like hours. The waitress came 3 times to refill our drinks and Idk why she never noticed that we didn't like it. Finally, we called her back to the table, and explained that we "LOVED everything here (except the granola pancakes)." Here's he awkward part... -She just stares at me, and says: "you didn't like it?" -me: "no, not really. But, we LOVED EVERYTHING ELSE!!!" -Waitress: "you really didn't like it?" -me: "umm, no, not really." -Waitress: "so you really didn't like it?" -me: [It's kinda awkward now you know, kinda awkward]......"no, not really." -Waitress: [just takes plate away and walks away, she didn't even clear the other dishes on the table.....] Well, that was awkward... She returns, gives us the check and charges us for the granola pancakes that we didn't like (mind you, we each only took a bite, barely ate anything). To not cause any ruckus, we just paid for everything. But, the moral of the story here: come here hungry, you'll get filled with deliciousness, as long as you do NOT order the granola pancakes. Because if you do, you probably would also realize that it's too dry and not eat it. But you would offend the waitress if you tell her that you didn't like it, and then you would still get charged for it. All in all, I won't mind coming back here for the beignets!!! Yummy, thankfully those were good enough to make me forget about the granola pancakes incident....  :-)

The food is amazing! It is worth the wait. That said, I have noticed that I get nausiated everytime I sit down at Brenda's. I brought someone here from out of town and afterwards she was so sick that we had to go to city hall for her to use the restroom. I was afraid it was the amazing food making people sick but on my last visit I realized it was the celing fans. The new design of Brenda's is beautiful New Orleans style with skylights and mirrors. The fans spin and refect a choppy bright light in all the mirrors and off the tops of the tables. It creates the feeling of strobe lighting and my vertigo/sea sickness kicks in.   If you are someone sensitive to motion sickness I would bring a dark cloth to cover your table, wear dark sunglasses, or take a dramamine. Do what ever it takes so you can enjoy that great food without feeling sick.

Ummm yeah!!! I LOVE this place! The cheddar and andouille sausage omelet is pretty much unbeatable. Oh, and did I mention they have biscuits? HUGE, flaky, buttery nuggets of bread that make you salivate just thinking about 'em. The beignets are pretty much the bomb also--personally I like the plain ones doused with powdered sugar the best. The coffee is nice and strong too and they serve it in a large mug which is good for us lazy people that don't like to keep asking for refills. There are only 2 cautions I have to report: 1) Come starving, but not SUPER starving...chances are you'll have to wait and 2) Don't even think about coming here if you're on a diet!

The scene: two extremely hungover NOLA natives transplanted to CA wait in line for Saturday morning brunch. Once seated it went down something like this: NOLA1: "Excuse me, do you serve any kind of alcohol? Bloody Marys, beer, anything?" Waitress: "No, sorry." -- 3 seconds of silence -- NOLA2: "Dude. You thinking what I'm thinking?" NOLA1: "Yeah, I'm with you. But where can we get liquor around here?" NOLA2: "This is the TL. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a liquor store." NOLA1 stands up and says, "I'm off to find some dead cats." And thus started the Great OJ and Booze party of Christmas 2008 at Brenda's. Our waitress was even cool enough not to bring us the regular sized OJ glasses, but instead the large ones filled 3/4 so that we wouldn't have to make room for the vodka. After about 10 minutes of pointing, the other patrons quickly realized what end is up and pretty soon everyone started to hit up the liquor store. Some grabbed gin, others vodka, and a particularly beautiful NOLA woman grabbed some champagne. BTW, particularly beautiful NOLA woman should send me a PM so we can watch Saints games. I'm tired of being the only drunken jackass Saints fan at Greens. To the food, we both got the grits and grillades. Why? For one, it was the most authentic New Orleans food they were serving that day. That and I've had that dish about a zillion times in my life. I know good and I've experienced bad. The conclusion was mutual -- solid grits and grillades. The grits were good, the biscuit was tasty, the eggs were there, but there was just something missing with the grillades. The sauce was great and the meat was of good quality. The meat could have been just a little more tender. Now, this is the ultra picky NOLA native food critic in me coming out. If you're not from there, you'll probably never know the difference. Yes, Brenda's is in a dodgy part of town. Yes, you will wait in line. Yes, it is small. No, you're not allowed to whine about any of these things. You know these facts going in. People that whine about these things are like people who complain about heat in summer... Why not 5 stars? The waitress charged us for five OJ's. Did we order five? Yeah, we sure did. But they could have comped us one or two for getting the entire restaurant on an OJ binge. They charge $2.50 for OJ poured out of a Tropicana bottle. It's pure markup and profit for them. A little lagniappe would have been that nice touch that gets them 5 stars.

I am dying to find a recipe to match Brenda's watermelon sweet tea, which I had to order after so many people yelped about it.  It is fantastic - just the right amount of sweetness, floating basil leaves, and a fresh watermelon taste that makes me wonder if the rinds are brewed in with the tea... I seriously spent a good hour this morning on various southern cooking websites looking for a comparable recipe.  If you find one, send it my way! Amazing biscuits & grits, homemade jam better than any I've had in ages, and wondefully delicious home-cooked tasting food that's all under $10.  I'm in! Minus one star for sort of inattentive service on a regular basis... Truly tasty: banana bread french toast, catfish po boy, hangtown fry, pot pie with biscuit top. Good if that's your thang: omelettes in general

Long wait. Bignets were awesome. Crawfish Bignets were the best. Not sweet, a bit spicy. Coffee wasn't special.  I don't drink much coffee cuz coffee makes me woozy, but I love the taste and smell of coffee. So when people say it's good coffee, I drink it anyway and just allow myself to be "in the clouds" for a few hours.  I wasn't so impressed. Next time I won't bother getting the coffee. However, I judge a brunch place by its eggs benedict.  It was awesome!  Fried fish was just the right crispiness and soft on the inside.  Eggs done perfectly so I can poke at the yolk and let it smother the biscuits that they were sitting on. So 5 stars for "well worth the wait because of the eggs benedict."

Imo, this place was a lot of Yelp hype. I waited at least an hour for a table with one other person. Then when I received the food, which was at least another half hour worth of wait, needless to say I wasn't too satisfied. I was almost surprised that it felt like I could've made my dish myself. Also if this is what French soul food is, I can't say I am too fond of it. I ordered the hangman fry, which wasn't too impressive in my opinion. The scramble of eggs and oyster was good. Good is not cutting it for 1.5 hours of wait. You don't wait 1.5 hours for Good, that is supposed to be AMAZING status. The potatoes were... depressing, I didn't eat most of it due to its lack in flavor. They were mushy and did not exhibit the type of seasoned flavor I was expecting. It was a beautiful golden brown without any taste. The biscuit was purty delicious actually. It was flakey and would make a good breakfast all by itself. The main thing that dragged it down to the 2 stars was my frd's granola pancake dish. I like pancakes, I like granola, and what would've seemed like a match made in heaven didn't quite make it. The granola was too chunky for the smooth pancake batter and its texture resembled that of granola that is molding. Crunchy but fluffy furry. I have had chunky things in pancakes and understand how hard it is to get it to work, but this is by far the worst chunky pancake I have ever had. I was so horrified by my main dishes that I was too afraid to try the beignets though I shoud've. I can not say that I am willing to come here again to try it the second time. I have no real reason to ever wait 1.5 hours for another meal.

I've always heard and/or read about Brenda's, but never had a chance to give it a try.  Luckily, the opportunity presented itself when we were looking for a breakfast place close to downtown. Even on a weekday morning, we had to wait for a table (though not too long) -- a sure sign that this place must be good. We were definitely tempted to get the beignets, but ended up with their two eggs with sausage (and side of potatoes) and an order of their french toasts. What an awesomely delicious breakfast!  Customer service was great also.  It was just one lady serving the a 30-or-so person dining room, but she was definitely on point and had everything under control. Reading all the other yelp reviews, I seem to have missed all their "signature" dishes.  Oh darn, I guess I'll have to come back!

I am a bit torn on which way to go with this review. On the one hand, the wait to get our food took forever as well as the Beignets with Chocolate were really heavy and didn't taste all that great. On the other hand, the Shirmp Po'Boy that the 7x7 list recommended was delicious. I guess in the end, what it comes down to is that I would definitely order the Shrimp Po'Boy again, but I will probably do take-out next time to avoid the wait. Definitely a great place to eat but I feel this place is a bit overrated as the food is just average overall.

Do you LOVE good food? How about good *soul* food? If so, Brenda's is the pace for you. I've been hearing good things about Brenda's for years, but never had the time or right person to invest waiting in the street for a seat. Well, I finally had the opportunity to try it out. Order the crawfish or plain beignets--the chocolate was really heavy, and the apple just didn't do it for me. And then don't pass up the shrimp with cheesy grits...um...yea! I ordered the sweet tea, but wasn't really impressed, but maybe I'm not a sweet tea kinda girl. Anyway...a coffee, tea, flight of beignets, and 2 entrées will run you about $37 pre-tip. Totally worth the wait.

Must get the beignet flight. The crawfish beignet was amazing.  If I weren't so full from my shrimp & grits, I would have ordered to go!  The shrimp & grits was amazing!  With the right amount of butter and a bit of bacon jam.  The serving size was huge and I wasn't able to finish.  A definite must if you are in the city!

A great spot for a heavy brunch or dinner.  The beignets were warm 'n tasty (but for those of you who are picky about beignets, these ones are heavy and doughy, and the crawfish one had too much seasoning piled on top).   The shrimp and grits was flavourful. Bit too much cheese piled on top for my taste. But all in all, the service was friendly. The decor lovely.  So much light in there!  And the meal was very enjoyable.  I'd go back for sure.

Just delicious! Awesome fast service, not that expensive. The biscuits may be the best I've ever had, especially topped w strawberry jelly. The only reason this is 4 stars not 5 is that we actually thought the chicken would be better. It tasted reheated. May have been the time of day, well give it another shot!

One of my favorite early morning/brunch places by far, featuring a flare for Cajun, southern style cooking. Brenda works her magic in the kitchen creating amazing Flights of Beignets filled with warm, oozing chocolate; spicy crawdad; and sweet apple pie filling. The Oyster Hangfry is a must for those who love eggs and seafood, so why not have both in this scrumptious scramble. The spicy & savory gumbo is just what you would expect out of a great tasting gumbo. If you want a refreshing drink, their specialty homestyle watermelon ice tea suits that well. Lastly, if you want to end on a sweet note, try their pancakes topped with butter pecan sauce. This place is not for the faint stomach.

I've had nothing but good meals at this place. I love it. The service is patient, attentive, and on it for being as slammed as they always are. I let our server Allison pick some of the must haves for us and she didn't disappoint. The beignets are AMAZING and their grits are just like my grandmother used to make. I just got back from New Orleans and was missing some of that French soul food- this hit the spot!

I saw the 4 stars, read the reviews, stood outside in line for an hour, so when I got seated I was expecting to be blown away!!! That didn't happen. The beignets were ok. We split the sampler (included: plain, filled with chocolate, filled with apples, and filled with craw-fish & such). We went savory to sweet, leaving the plain to be devoured last. Honestly they were over cooked. If you want amazing beignets that LITERALLY melt in your mouth go to Just for You in Potrero (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). We split the Eggs & Bacon Tartine - which I will admit was mighty tasty, however nothing I would necessarily crave. Potato hash was done very well. All in all I just think Brenda's isn't worth the hype (or the wait). I may swing by again on a week day without the wait to give it another try. However, the City is FILLED with yummy brunch places so...

FIRST SOUL FOOD in my tummy... sweet watermelon tea sounds delicious, DONT BE FOOLED, its definitely not my cup of tea. we were an indecisive bunch so we ordered Beignet Flight (plain, chocolate, apple, crawfish). Crawfish would be my #1 favorite. Plain is not worth it. I would choose an apple pie a la mode and chocolate cupcake over the apple & chocolate beignet. creole veggie omelette sounds healthy but OMG its greasy. croque monsieur is rich but flavorful. I would come back for the crawfish beignet if there is no line.

The metered parking is reminiscent of school parking meters. The 1.5 hour wait caused me to feed the meter a few times, and made me rush a little more to finish my meal. The place is tiny, and the bathroom is in the back beyond the kitchen. You need to walk by all the cooks, and I was really trying hard not to be a klutz and cause a scene. Luckily, I made it without harming anyone. So the food...my favorite was the watermelon iced tea. My friend and I shared the goat cheese and shrimp omelet, the shrimp and grits, and the flight of beignets. These are heavier than the New Orleans beignets. My favorite was the chocolate and crawfish. The shrimp and grits were good, but a bit too oily for my taste. I liked the omelet, goat cheese makes everything good.  The service was lacking a bit, neither I nor my friend could catch our waitress to get a check. I had to ask another waitress, but it eventually came and we eventually left so not a huge deal. I do not think I would come back unless the service improves and the wait time decreases, it definitely took away from the food.

I was hungry and looking to try something new. I saw tons of positive reviews so i decided to stop by on a Sunday afternoon around 12. OMG the line was super long. We put our names down and almost an hr later we finally got a seat. This place is REALLY small but cozy. The menu was definitely unique. We ordered the Crayfish beignets and it was delicious! The bf had Shrimp & Grits and i had the Hangtown Fry: bacon & oyster omelette. Will not order the oyster omelette next time because it's a bit too hearty for me, though, it was different. The watermelon ice tea is just brilliant! I love it and free refills! I will definitely come back and try other dishes.  2 thumbs up!

Brenda's was the highlight of my recent trip to the bay area. It was so great, I went twice. If you go on a weekend expect to wait, unless you get there at 8 in the morning. My lady and I did the hour plus wait for brunch, and did the no wait on a weekday for lunch. On our visits we ate... Beignets-huge and filling, everything the yelpers say they are The Watermelon sweet tea-I am not a tea drinker and I couldn't get enough of this stuff The Andouille and cheese omelette-Good, but not great The eggs benedict w/ fried chicken- Legendary! The shrimp poboy-Yummm! The BFC (Best Fried Chicken)-Honey and Spice and everything Nice, it lives up to it's boastful name, but a bit greasy Brenda's has great food and friendly service, but the thing that suprised me most is the reasonable price of everything on the menu. Meals are about $15-$20 per person for a entree, drink, and flight of beignets. It's a definite can't miss if you're visiting the SF area.

Super awesome beignets and Macaroni & Cheese! I was actually expecting more crawfish or some kind of etouffe here, but I was pleasantly by all the choices, from oysters, fried chicken, gumbo, beignets, and po'boys. For dinner we had: Crawfish beignet:  huge beignet, real fluffy, tasty crawfish filling, great touch with the cayenne pepper Fried Chicken:  order this a la carte, one piece ($4-5), excellent breading, perfectly fried, not like your KFC chicken Mac & Cheese:  baked in a cup with goat cheese, topped with cheddar cheese.  it was REAL cheesy and the goat cheese was amazingly good. Sausage & Chicken gumbo:  the sausage and chicken were very tender, the okra didn't make the gumbo too slimy, but it is still somewhat slimy. Cornmeal shrimp po'boy:  good shrimp, but the sauce they put on top was very overwhelming, ask to put the sauce on the side if you prefer. Watermelon tea was excellent here and free refills!!!  you can actually get small pieces of watermelon in the tea, well done Brenda, well done.

It is my goal to try the whole menu, from top to bottom. The beignet flight:  Plain, Apple, chocolate, and my personal favorite:  Crawfish.   The fried catfish eggs benedict, with a side of hash and a buttery and flaky biscuit the size of my fist with some strawberry jam:  You won't have to eat for the rest of the day.  Fried catfish for breakfast?  Yeah, especially after New Year's eve. Simply put, everything I've had here, I've thoroughly enjoyed.  I always order the Watermelon Sweet tea.  Light, sweet, and free refill after refill.  Sometimes as we're walking down Polk Street we see a crowd of people in front of the door waiting to be seated, but we normally don't have to wait, or our wait is consistently less than 10 minutes.  The waitresses are quick and attentive, and I like the renovated space.  Reminds me of those small holes-in-the-wall in New York city that are surprisingly light and airy. Oh, and the portions are nice and big, more than my woman can usually finish.  Which means I get to eat the rest of hers.

I'm a sucker for friendly servers who call their customers "Honey" and keep the tea and coffee filled to the brim all through the meal, especially at no charge. This may seem like a no-brainer, but many times you'll look at a bill closely and see "coffee x 2" for one person... well not this place. I'm pretty hesitant to advertise this place because it's really tiny, and the more popular it gets, the more difficult it'll be for me to get down there from FiDi for lunch and get seated + eat within one hour. But I can't in good conscience hold out from my fellow foodies. If you work around City Hall, Van Ness, the TL or tendernob, go here for lunch. Get the gumbo. Go back to work happy. The best part? For two people, huge plate of gumbo + plate off the breakfast menu + two coffees + tea + biscuit + bignettes = $21.15. Hell yea.

I've been craving for beignet and poboy for a long time. After seeing so many good reviews, we decided to give it a try. Overall, the brunch was good. The gumbo was excellment. We ordered the beignet flight. Well, the crashfish one was new and great; the chocolate one was good, the traditional plain beignet was just somewhere not as good as the one from cafe du monde and we didn't like the apple one too much. My husband and I ordered shrimp poboy and oyster poboy one of each. They both taste great but a little bit over greasy. We will definitely go back to Brenda's once a while because so far you can't find a better place in the city offers the same qualify beignets and poboys. Maybe sometime we should just book a trip back to New Orleans again...

Hard to find, yummy food at super reasonable prices? Shooooooooooooot...I'm there!  My only complaint is that it does take virtually forever to get seated since it's always so crowded and they don't take reservations, but hey, I understand.  It's all business, right? I had the turkey Sloppy Joe (forgot what it's called) and tried the assortment of Beignets the first time I visited and man, the portions were HUGE!  That was lunch AND dinner for me...score!  The lovely ladies I was with all enjoyed their food as well.  Second time around, I was in for breakfast and had......okay, I actually forgot, but I remember it being a very positive experience, save for the long wait of course. Will be bringing more folks with me to this place the next time I get a chance!  I think everyone should try Brenda's at least once.

this place is the *BEST* for brunch.  You MUST be prepared to wait though.  I think we showed up around 10:30 am on Sunday for brunch and it was about an hour before we were seated.  The place is tiny, so if you have a group bigger than 4 forget it. Things to try - beignet flight.  best idea ever and don't eat the plain one last because you'll think it isn't as good as the rest.  The other three flavors (apple, chocolate and a savory crawfish) are amazing. The pancake portions are huge - and very sweet.  YUMMY.   Service is friendly, though not super fast.  They do have take-out which I would recommend if you just want awesome food but don't want to wait forever and don't care about the squishy/cozy ambiance.   Definitely going on my good deal list - nothing we had was over $10.  totally worth the wait as long as you're mentally prepared for the wait.

I will review this place again with 5 effin' stars. I have been here 4 times, and I have had something mind-blowing every time. Last time I went I had the special Egg Benedict: Two poached eggs over thinly slice catfish on a fresh homemade biscuit, smothered with the most delicious spicy mustardy hollandaise sauce and a side of their perfectly seasoned potatoes. I waited 1 1/2 hours to get seated and it was worth every minute. I know there are bfast places that get a lot of hype on yelp but don't live up to the expectation, Brenda's however, does. GO HERE! EAT HERE! I don't know what else I can tell you, it's just so good.

Exceptional biscuits.  Just for that Brenda's deserves four lovely stars.  Flaky on the outside and soft in the inside. So so good.  Perfectly paired with pretty much anything.  The last time I was there the biscuits went well with tasty corned beef hash and eggs. The salty and very orange crawfish beignets were surprisingly good as well. Be forewarned that the line can be long so the best time to go to Brenda's is really early in the morning.

So anyone on the hunt for the best breakfast in San Francisco has waited in line for an hour to get into Dottie's True Blue only to be a little put off by the attitude on ocassion once inside.  I found Brenda's somewhat similar to Dottie's but without the attitude. We did wait for a long time here, but this is to be expected as it is small inside, but the crowd itself makes for great people watching.  Unlike many other places, the team works the list with dilligence and seems generally sensitive to how long people wait to appreciate them.  I heard, "thank you for waiting," uttered several times showing a real touch of class. Inside is hipster cool with an amazingly reconfigurable interior.  A group of 7 went in before us and they found space for them in the postage stamp dining room.  Of particular note is a counter setup on one wall that actually accommodates a lot of people.  While we were waiting and there, I saw three single diners come through. On the food front,  I had the andouille sausage omlette with grits and a biscuit.  The omlette was advertised with a spicy sauce which I was a bit worried about as so many with omlettes are just bad, but this one turned out to be fantastic. Elaine had the Hangtown fry.  An omlette made with fried oysters?  Not my thing, but it turned out to be very good so good that as non-oyster fan, I might just go for it next time. The staff was very attentive and  my coffee cup was always full. Rounding out the story of small was my trip to the bathroom.  You go through te kitchen, which isn't uncommon in SF, but the aisle way here is the narrowest I have ever seen - so narrow the staff has worked out a system of calling out "incoming" and "outgoing" to get everyone to reposition so that guests can come through.  This again, was a touch of class in what must be a pain for this large team trying to delivery great and timely eats from this tiny kitchen. When I go again, it will probably be early, but if not we'll make another shopping trip to Lee's Sandwiches while we wait. Note, we saw a construction sign next door. Perhaps they are expanding.  We'll keep our fingers crossed.  This would be a well deserved business expansion for a great concept.

Let's play a game of word association shall we? Brenda. Brenda's got a baby by Tupac Brenda K. Starr the singer. Brenda from 90210. and now I add Brenda's French Soul Food to that list. Nothing really to add to the 800 plus reviews and the 4 star rating. Carla ordered the hangtown omelette special, bacon and oysters... wow! I'll order that next time I go here. The Bignet flight is a good starter, although I enjoyed the crawfish one the least (it was just ok compared to the sweet bignets). And the biscuits.... yummy! Only complaint is the wait is super long, but well worth the wait!

Watermelon iced tea-sooo yummy.  Grits-hope you like them cheesy and buttery! i seriously could eat a whole bowl just of grits (then have to run for about 5 hours to work it off).  In my table, it seemed like everyone thought their entree's were just a little bit above Ok.  I had the veggie omelet, and wasn't that impressed.   however, the pancake was fanfrikkintastic.  i've reccomended this place to tons of people, and really want to go back and try the beignets, and if they have the bananas foster french toast, that's a definite must have.

Highlights: Had the Eggs Benedict special and the biscuits are fatastic! The Watermelon Iced Tea is pretty refreshing.. I found myself wishing to be resting on some old southern plantation porch to really make the most of how cooling it was. The southern style menu was just fun to see. Down sides: Getting yelled at by a biker in front of the restaurant because I exited a taxi and wasn't really paying attention.. err wait that doesn't have anything to do with the restaurant. The beignets were not that great-- while very cute in theory, they just tasted like overgrown doughnut holes filled with apples (or crawfish or chocolate. depending on what you get.) Not at all like New Orleans' finest. Good food, glad I tried it once, probably not a need to go back anytime really soon. Too many other places in the city to try.

My experience at brunch was slightly mixed.  I ordered their Saturday special: shrimp grits, which sounded very interesting~ I was excited.  My boyfriend got a more traditional breakfast plate with eggs(maybe it was an omelet), hash, the ushe.   When we got our food, mine was a glistening orange color~ from the oils and greases that were present in a clear layer on top of my food.  Nonetheless, I decided to delve into this orange sea which proved to be VERY tasty.  Southern comfort food I'd say, but maybe not so comforting.  I was actually participating in a very high paced "high trek" race (similar to the popular "amazing race" on TV); and at the verrrry beginning of the race... lets just say my stomach was not doing too well.  Anyway~ I think it was the excessive greasy oils that messed around too much in the tummy, and made it pretty unhappy.   My boyfriend's plate was good.   I'm probably pretty much completely discouraged to get those grits again, but it may be possible for me to venture there to try something more on the dry side.  There was about a 20 minute wait when we went~ Their service was pretty good~ it was a cute diner inside and I didn't use it, but I think there was only one bathroom.   As of right now; I think I'd prefer another venue if I were ever to recommend a brunch in the city... To end on a happy note, I absolutely loved their biscuits!

My friend drove into town and we had the option of going to Mama's (which I had been raving to her about) or Brenda's (which we've both never been to).  Since it was Thursday morning we had no wait and were seated promptly.  The space is very cute and feels like home, but other than that nothing else really stood out.  We ordered the beignet flight but found them to be hard and average.  The watermelon sweet tea was something I was looking forward to, but in the end I would have rather had either sweet tea or watermelon juice, but not the way it was done here. The rest of our food was not bad, but just nothing special either.  The worst part was knowing I just missed out on a chance to grab another yummy breakfast at Mama's!  Don't get me wrong, I love me some soul food and I'm addicted to French, but Brenda's misses the mark for both.

Came here with high expectations. Heard so much about their brunch that i couldn't wait. Left here so disappointed. My friend actually left angry. Firstly, service was horrible. Both my friends were ready but I was having a hard time deciding what to get. Our waitress came and took my friends' orders but I asked if she could come back in a few minutes for mine. i guess this was a heinous crime or something because she left looking pissed and we noticed her mumbling something to the other waitress. when i was ready to order, i waved to our waitress but the other one came instead. i guess our original waitress did not want to deal with us anymore. i don't know why because we were polite and not rude at all. so i decided on watermelon iced tea and an omelet with everything on the side. i asked if that would be okay since i know it could be annoying for the chef. the waitress said it would be fine, just a little bit more work. what she failed to mention was that it'd cost me $2 extra and an attitude at the end. watermelon iced tea lived up to expectations. it was so good and refreshing. the beignets sampler was not good at all though. the craw fish was excellent but the chocolate and sugar ones were nasty. beignets should be soft, fluffy but these sweet beignets were stale, rough and dry. perhaps they gave us the day old ones since we apparently sucked so much. my omelet (deconstructed) wasn't very good either. maybe it would have been better had i stuck to the original menu. my friend's oyster poboy was good, not great. it's really hard to mess up poboys in my mind. my other friend's cesar was bland, looked more like a cafeteria cesar salad than from an actual restraunt (with such good reviews!). so we got the check and were all so surprised by the extra charges. we were all sour already because the food didn't live up to expectations and also because service was so bad. to see we were charged extra for something as trivial as putting things on the side was the last blow. when asked about the charges, the waitress seemed as if they deserved the extra money, not at all apologetic that she failed to mention such charges when i had first ordered, especially since i specifically asked if it would be ok. maybe they ddn't like us and purposely sent us their bad food or something, but i really don't see why brenda's [lack of soul] is so popular.

After a long drive home from Davis at 5 in the morning the SO and decided going home and sleeping didn't sound good.  Figuring we had nothing better to do we drove around downtown until Brenda's opened and got breakfast. Upon entering the place we noticed that it was already beginning to get packed and it wasn't even open for more than 15 minutes so we knew it was a good sign.  Like everyone else has said, the place is small so if your claustrophobic go elsewhere.  We didn't mind and after being seated the server came over right away with menus and asking us if we would like anything to drink.  The service was spot on I never felt rushed even though there were quite a few people waiting around.  The food came out in a timely fashion and this is where it got good.   Between us we ordered a Beignet Flight, pumpkin pancakes, and gumbo.  The beignet flight came out first and we jumped right in going down the line.  Each one was amazing and really there isn't much to say about them that hasn't been said 1000 times.  They had just enough crisp on the outside, but were all extremely fluffy on the inside and the crawfish beignet was delicious.  Not what i expected at all, but somehow it worked and worked well.  The pancakes were okay, nothing to write home about, but I have to admit that the vanilla buttercream that came with it was delicious.  The gumbo was pretty good too, but really the beignets are where its at and they are pretty filling if you ask me.   All in all it was a great experience and it didn't break the bank, but if i were to come back it would be for the beignets.

Why do all the good breakfast/brunch spots in the city have to be so small?? Expand!!! Nevertheless, I would still wait x amount of time to partake in the deliciousness that is Brenda's. Hangtown fry, shrimp & grits, and the obligatory beignet flight makes for a perfect meal.  You probably wont finish all the beignets after a full meal, but do not fret, because they are still good as leftovers. Just re-heat in the oven and if you're feeling adventurous enough, eat a la mode with vanilla ice cream.  De-freakin-licious.

I was in the sometimes exasperating culinary landscape of civic center/tenderloin just got exciting with the addition of this small, charming restaurant. my friend had given me the menu, and just one look at it filled me with positive vibes. my restaurant gut instinct told me that this was going to be GOOD, so i skedaddled over today and loved it.  so grateful to have brenda's within walking distance of my friends work. given such a tiny space, they compensate with a terrific ambiance and simple, stylish decor. specials are written on the mirror, which the counter seating faces. Beignets, beignets, BEIGNETS!  They are chock full of ingredients like chocolate or apple cinnamon spice, or great plain.  Perfectly done!  We ordered the beignets flight sampler and gobbled down the chocolate, cinnamon apple, and crawfish beignets. they were fun and tasty. my favorite though was the chocolate one - take one bite and you hit a pool of molten chocolate. next we devoured our fried shrimp po' boy and shrimp/goat cheese/tomato-bacon relish/caramelized onion omelette with biscuit and tater hash. EVERYTHING was satisfying and well done. it's not just that the food was pleasant, delicious, and purdy to look at, but the overall atmosphere was inviting and down-to-earth too. lots of warmth, despite the grim environs right outside the door. bonus: the chef/owner is not only female, she's also filipina-creole. AWESOME. Before  l leave town, I will go back to try the jambalaya, gumbo, house salad , and other creative goodies. btw - their biscuits are the most picturesque in the world.

The line is always so freakin' long that I've never actually eaten at the restaurant, so this review is based solely on the beignets flight. Hubby bought it to go and my first thought was why didn't they box it, esp since there were 4 orders (16 beignets).  Thus, those on the bottom of the paper bag were flat and the powder sugar was a little soggy.  It wasn't even arranged for each flavor into one bag so we had to guess which was what (expect for the crawfish as those were apparent). Ok, so that's just a little grip esp cuz it's not cheap, $2.50 each (total: $40).  Onto the taste: Ate the beignets pretty much right away (about 30 mins from leaving the restaurant).  We prefer the crawfish beignet.  The sweet ones (apple, chocolate, and no filling) were ok, not too sweet which is the way I like it.  The outer texture was a bit dense as I'm comparing it to the New Orleans Cafe Du Monde's beignet.  If the line isn't so crazy, I'll still visit Brenda's in the future.

While I'm usually quick to shed light on a recent restaurant visit--especially one I enjoyed--I'm struggling with Brenda's.  I like the atmosphere, the wait staff, the food and the overall dinner situation (NOTE: Dinner had NO wait!)...but something wasn't there for me with this place... I can't put my finger on it...could have been the great start for the meal (we ordered side dishes for apps, OMG--get the mac and cheese, hush puppies and yams) and disappointing end....dessert beignets were surprisingly mediocre and my meal was, fine. Or maybe I was too excited for Devo...so the meal was just a footnote on my evening-of-Awesome. Still! It was worth the trip and at least a three star venture!

I had been hoping to find a good southern cooking place this side of United States. All the best flavors you can ask for are found in every dish. I had the Croque Monsieur and I got to try some of my friends' omlettes. The vast array of strong southern flavors blend beautifully in each dish. And the cheese grits being nice and smooth are always a bonus!

**3.5 stars** I almost passed out in front of Brenda's. 1. I was extremely starving. 2. The food smelled SO good that I stubbornly refused to eat anywhere else except at Brenda's, despite the one hr long wait time. Crayfish Beignet: came out in 3, which me and my friend shared. Actually I wasn't too excited about it despite the rave reviews. It was dough-y, like a stuffed salty donut? It just wasn't for me... Peach Cobbler Pancakes: pure awesome-ness. It was their weekend special and really caught my attention. It wasn't too overly sweet, had huge chunks of peaches and powdered sugar. Plus, the two pancakes were really, really fluffy. My friend couldn't keep his fork away! It came with this heavenly cream on the side, which in fact was really the icing to the cake! Service was fantastic! Next time, I would love to try their eggs benedict, as it seemed like 90% of the people were ordering them. Happy endings DO come to those who wait!!

I'm glad this place is finally expanding because one can get pretty claustrophobic in such small quarters for such a busy place! My friend first took me here last year and said that I had to try the crawfish beignets, and I was hooked! It's a shame that I live far away and can only venture to Brenda's every so often to eat their food. My first meal was the grillades and grits. I've had grits at Roscoe's before so I wasn't expecting much, but Brenda's grits were very flavorful! I also really enjoyed the biscuit, which was so moist and fluffy, I didn't even need to use any spread. The catfish po' boy is also really good, with the creamy fattening sauce that gets my hands all dirty, but I enjoy licking my fingers afterward. Shrimp and grits has a little sweet kick to it. Not bad, but it wouldn't be my last meal. Crawfish beignets - if you've never had them, go there to try them. Well, I think you can only get them here. I can't find anywhere else that has savory beignets on their menu.  YUMMY! Makes me never want to eat a sweet beignet EVER! I would give this place a 4 1/2 stars, but I can't give halves. The half star is only for the small space and long wait, but hopefully that will soon change after they're done remodeling.

So I came away with a stomach ache... but I dreamt of eating those crawfish beignets for a week!   Loved the tangy collard greens that came with the fried chicken.  We also ordered the sweet potato dumplings that there weren't enough of....  My wife ordered the watermelon tea which she liked - refreshing and simple with chucks of watermelon pieces to chew on :]  I drank a bottle of one of their Louisiana beers.  I think I liked it enough.  Anyways, we shared the meal and appetizers, and still think we ate too much.  Glad to walk home. The place is small and packed, with a super high ceiling so never felt claustrophobic.  I liked it.  And would go back just to get two more of those crawfish beignets :]

Food was pretty good.  I was super excited to try the beignets, but they were just okay.  I've definitely had better beignets.   This place gets very packed and there is a wait, and usually a very long wait.  Once seated, the staff tries very hard to ensure you're taken care of despite the chaos.   Overall, I don't know if I'd return since the food was just okay, but not okay enough to wait too long for.

YUM.  This place is not in the bestest of neighborhoods but WHO CARES when there's Watermelon Iced Teas, different kinds of Beignets, Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and a whole lot more!   I came here for Brunch and got the Egg and Bacon Tartine which was pretty good....although I wish I had gotten the special for that day which is   what my friend ordered - the eggs benedict - probably the best i've ever tasted!   I probably would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for the parking situation....

As a former New Orleaner, I've been skeptical with Cajun/Creole places outside the Crescent City. This place? Some of the best I've had since I left. Try the cheese grits, catfish po-boy and homestead fry (with oysters and bacon). The beignets aren't Cafe Du Monde quality, but definitely filling, and the waitstaff is sweet and helpful. Look forward to trying more meals there!

Went here for brunch even though we knew it was going to be a long wait but it was definitely worth it. It was hard to decide what to get starting with the beignets, luckily they offer a tasting where you get one of each for $8. Nice. Then the two of us split  the bananas foster and and each attempted to finish off their own dish, the veggie omelette (delicious) and the croque monsieur (looked delicious). It was a lot of food but we were up to the challenge. Totally worth the wait.

This review does not really have to do with the food too much since I was there for breakfast and all I got was bacon and eggs with some toast. But I did have a bite or 2 of my sisters plate which was a crazy creole style omelet with cheddar and andoullie sausage with shrooms. Enough with the food on with the ambiance!!! Okay this place is in the G-E-T-T-O! But, the outside is like a diamond in the rough. It was really the only modern looking signage on the block with a newer paint job. The inside was incredible, a very small place but it was designed perfectly. It looked like there wasn't much room for anyone but it prolly could fit about 40 people or so. The paint and whole interior was very modern but cozy at the same time. The service was great, prompt and the prices weren't half bad either. Honestly the food could have sucked and this place still would have gotten 3 stars due to service, design, comfyness, and originality. We should have came here for lunch because the menu for lunch looked ALOT better than breakfast, but hey Ill have to come back soon. Thanks again Brenda!

I actually waited a whole 1 hour and 40 mins for a table for 2 on Sat at 1230...Seriously....and I am still giving Brendas 5 stars...that says a lot. We ended up walking to Turtle Tower to see if we should get pho instead..put our name down on that list too...then decided that we would perservere and see what the hype was about. When it got to 2pm and I just couldn't take it anymore...I broke down and went to the dirty Taco Bell/KFC next door and got 2 tacos. Right when I left though...I witnessed 6 people come out of the red door...happily gave my tacos to the wheelchair ridin...potty mouthed homeless dude on the corner...and ran back to look at the list. Yes! We were next! The place is so super small...it says max capacity is 40 but I already felt claustraphobic when there were 28 people packed in the room. Sat down and immediately ordered...flight of beignets, shrimp and grits, grillades and grits, cup of gumbo, and watermelon iced tea...OH YEA!!!! Everything was great! The flight was great for indecisive peeps like myself...and there's unlimited refills on the spectacular watermelon iced tea! double yay! I never had grits I liked in the city....these grits tasted just like I imagine Paula Deenes TV grits to be...but 10x more buttery and cheesy...it's butter heaven! I also never had gumbo I liked...and I'm still astonished at how something so muddy looking can taste so delicious. I'll definitely come back..but next time I'll come earlier...since they were out of a couple of their specials (no pork chops left..boo) and the wait was just out of control.

Yes, the wait is ridiculous (1.5 hours on a Saturday around 12pm to be exact) and yes, you have to wait outside in a less than desirable part of SF but the food makes it oh-so-worth it. Brenda's spin on a classic eggs benedict was the highlight of my visit (and possibly my weekend) Instead of an english muffin you get a savory biscuit and plain ol' boring hollandaise sauce is replaced with a cajun style hollandaise sauce.  The sauce and the biscuit together with the egg and ham are just magic. I was licking the plate. The pork rib special with cheddar grits was interesting but a little too soupy for my taste. The watermelon iced tea is as good as everyone says - refreshing but sweet at the same time. And the beignets....oh, the beignets. The glorious chocolate filled pastries had to accompany me home because I was too full to take even a single bite. It's ok though, they made a great snack when I woke up from my food induced coma. Recommendations: -Get there early before the breakfast rush or wait forever -One entree plus some beignets is plenty of food for two people -Don't make big post-Brenda's plans, your bed will be calling your name!

My boyfriend finally got me to go to Brenda's with him, after many failed attempts due to work schedule clashes. I was fearful that we'd be waiting forever...but we only had to stand outside for about 15 minutes. It was wise to go on a Monday. The area was very crammed but in a strange cozy way. Since we skimmed the menu outside both me and my beau knew what we wanted. I started my meal off with the watermelon ice tea, which was very refreshing and different. My guy got scrambled eggs, a biscut, and grits. I got grits, a biscut, and a customized omlette. I was a little weary that my omlette which consisted of mushrooms, onions, scallions, and cheese wouldn't be all that great...but it was FANTASTICAL! We also got potato hash to share. Everything was so tasty and bursting with flavor. I was expecting my food to be dripping with grease, but everything was fine. I will surely be back, however I'll be sure to make sure it's on a monday morning. Didn't get to try the beniets, maybe next time though! The potato hash was good, a little spicy so avoid if you're not a fan of hot food. However I would have probably just stuck with the grits. They were cheesy and perfect. Brenda's is a tiny jewel that everyone must discover for themselves. I only wish that they'd consider expanding or moving to a bigger spot.

If i were a meal, then I would be brunch. But at Brenda's I am breakfast because I would never arrive at this place later than 8 o'clock in the morning. The line can get long and the wait is terrible if you don't get there right when it opens. The food, however, does not disappoint.   If you decide to eat only one breakfast food for your entire life, then eat the biscuits at Brenda's. WOMAN, what is in your biscuits?! Probably lots of butter, but holy, these biscuits are perfectly flaky and soft and go incredibly well with the homemade jam on the table. Another must at Brenda's are the beignets. We did the flight, which was too much for my boyfriend and I, but it was good to sample all the flavors (Apple, Chocolate, Crawfish w/ Cayenne and Plain) If you just want to chose one flavor, I would go for the chocolate because chocolate is always the default for anything. Ever. The French toast is really delicious and rich, so I would opt to have the pecan sauce on the side and enjoy at your own pace. The hangtown omelet (bacon and oysters) is perhaps one of the greatest things invented in Cajun cooking and I love them for it. The Louisiana hot sauce (not so hot but flavor is there) goes great with all savory dishes because it adds that bit of je ne sais qua to the food i.e. tangyness and spice? If I am craving breakfast soul food, nothing short of death will prevent me from waking up on a Saturday morning to get there before 8:00 a.m. p.s. Watermelon Iced Tea is New Orleans Summer liquefied and put into a glass.

Talk about over-hyped! This place is a crowning example of how a line out the door does not equal good food. And it's one thing to get lousy food, there's plenty of terrible places to eat around here, but I'm not about to shovel out this much money for a meal I couldn't even stomach to finish. Seriously, this was the first time I've ever NOT finished my meal, it was THAT bad. How could people line up for this place? I don't even care for ketchup and I found myself dumping it on just to see if I could put down one more bite of eggs. PS I couldn't. If only Yelp had a negative scoring system, but it wouldn't matter, negative infinity stars wouldn't do this place justice.

Entered unaware that it was like "a big deal." We had just come from city hall with a license in hand and were hungry and wanted a hot meal before our ceremony later in the day. So dumbly we ambled up Polk and there it was, almost immediately after declaring "let's just walk for a few minutes and see if we find something near here." With steamy windows and not a seat to spare at 9:15am, in a low-foot-traffic spot, it was intriguing. Everything served was outstanding. The breakfast could have been completely average and we would have remembered it regardless, as this was our final pre-marital meal; but it was so far above average that we walked out essentially with tears of joy in our eyes, not a chance of forgetting what was experienced. I mean this place is hot shit. It just is. Upon departure, my betrothed stated of the plate of shrimp and grits he had polished off, "I want to have a three-way marriage with you and it." Easily the most memorable breakfast shared in the course of a relationship. Without a doubt one of the best meals had in 2010. We look forward to stopping in for dinner some day.

Stuffed beignets were pretty special--I would suggest getting the "flight" so you can try all four. My grits and shrimp was just ok...way too much cheddar cheese. The grits were really buttery. Shrimp was fine, but nothing special. My friend's catfish eggs benedict were AWESOME and I wish I had gotten that instead.

This place is located in a not so enticing location but the service and food take all of that away.  We came in & put our name down on the chalkboard & were seated minutes later. I tried the Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea, the Beignet Flight, and the Vegan Josephine.  The tea was very refreshing with pieces of watermelon, I would highly recommend trying it.  The Beignet Flight was good, I would just order the Crawfish ones next time though, yum :)  the Vegan Josephine was very good as well. Service was quick even though it was a full house with many people coming in to wait as well.  Would highly recommend stopping by.

Okay, my wife and I came in for breakfast so my apologies for the rating.  Very much like the setting, bright and comfy, a tad tight but cool nevertheless.  Service is great, and staff was very friendly.  Let's get to the food.  We had the beignet sampling and thought it was quite good, especially with my coffee.  I had the hang town fry, and thought it was just okay.  A little over cooked, and the country potatoes was a bit mushy.  Nothing special I thought.  My wife had French toast, and somewhat surprised with the rather regular sized slices.  However, that pecan syrup was phenomenal!  Bring that sucker on and drown them toast!  Coulda drank that syrup by itself and I woulda given 5 stars.  I guess we gotta come back for dinner and eat the "real" foods.  Looking forward to trying the fried chicken.

I came here on a Wednesday evening a little bit before 6pm and got seated immediately.  We placed our orders, received our watermelon iced tea, and 45 minutes passed and still no food.  Not only did we not have any food yet... but no one even bothered to check on us and ask "hey guys... why are you guys sitting in a restaurant and not enjoying our delicious noms?".  To me, that would be the most logical question... but our server didn't once stop by our table to check on us, she didn't even put our order in!!  Another server ended up taking over for our order, and thankfully, she was very apologetic and put our order in ASAP. She even offered us some gumbo, but we had already ordered a ton of food and didn't want to spoil our meal.  In the end, they ended up comping our crawfish beignets, which was very kind of them.  Although our new server was extremely nice and attentive, and they comped our beignets, I just can't give them 5 stars because of our ridiculous wait and our original server never even apologized.  I contemplated giving them 3 stars, but hey, mistakes happen, and their food is bomb-digity. Okay - enough with the complaints and on with the food!! Crawfish beignets - HUGE PORTIONS.  Stuffed with goodness, and a nice spicy kick to it.  It's on the 7x7 list too, so definitely order this when you come here. Shrimp & Grits - I didn't order this but my friend did.  I had a bite and it was so rich.  Cheese, shrimp, grits, bacon, and green onions all in one bowl.  I couldn't imagine having this to myself.  He didn't even finish the whole thing, but it was still very tasty.   Oyster Po Boy - YUM!  Definitely reminded me of my experience in NOLA.  This was a very hefty sandwich and they fill the po boy with a lot of fried oysters.  Nothing wrong with that :) Mac and Cheese side - a nice crispy cheesy cover on top of the mac and cheese to seal in the gooey-ness heaven that awaits inside.  I wish I wasn't full from all of the food listed above, so that I could've eaten more. Watermelon Iced Tea - not sure what the hype is over this.  It was okay and glad I tried it.  A little sweet and a hint of watermelon, but I don't think I'd order this again. All in all, great meal! I ended the night with some shooting pains in my side!  The sure sign that you had a truly "New Orleans-esque" meal.

After I waited for an hour in one of "nicest" neighborhood of SF, the food really wasn't that impressive. Maybe it's because I'm from the south originally, I have a higher expectation of "French Soul Food", I automatically thought about the wonderful flavors I experienced in New Orleans. We ordered the beignets according to popular demand, really not what I had expected. The beignets here are somewhat dry and lacking texture, the ones I had before from Houston had more of a donut texture, which I personally prefer. Then we also ordered the special eggs benedict which was average, cool thing about that is they put it on a biscuit, rather than a english muffin that it usually comes on. Same thing with the biscuit, a bit dry and lacking that fresh biscuit aroma, I can think of a few places that can make a better biscuit, Red Lobster and my own kitchen. The best thing about the whole meal was the watermelon ice tea which they infused normal ice tea with fresh watermelons and basil/mint leaves, quite refreshing.

I don't recommend this place if you are planning to have a short, quick lunch.  I got to the restaurant at 11:30am and waited about 20 mins just for a table for two. Assorted Beignets:  plain - was good (I would just order the plain ones again) crawfish - center was cold (should it be like this?) apple - way too much cinnamon (can't taste the apple) chocolate - ok (they should use nutella instead) Gumbo:  there was a consensus with my lunch crew that it was too strong; too much of a burnt taste ??? not sure how to describe it Red beans & rice w/ andouille sausage:  really good, flavorful with a nice kick of spice

Was so lucky to find parking across the street from Brenda's.  Have been wanting to eat here for ages. . and ladies and gents, it is well worth the wait  - even on a Monday, there was still a line out the door. .  We started with the beignet sampler - was yummy.  I opted for the red beans, rice and sausage (only to find 1/2 a sausage cut lengthwise) ouch.  But since I was full from the beignets, only picked at it, ate a third of it, took the rest home and even cold from the fridge the next day, it tasted pretty awesome.  I forgot what my friend had (something with grits) but she mentioned it was quite delicious. . looking forward to return for my grits and french toast. . . And the wait staff was professional, attentive and very friendly despite all the madness.

Tried this place on a friend's recommendation.  There was hardly any wait around 11am on a Thursday.  I saw the Travel+Leisure article saying it was one of the 50 Best New Restaurants of 2009.  I also read the 7X7 article and we ordered everything they recommended. The Crawfish Beignets were very nice.  Gooey and oozing with a cheesy crawfish filling, a little greasy with some cajun spices sprinkled on top.  Reminded me of malasadas in Hawaii. The Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo was very tasty, slightly spicy and one of the best I've tasted. Lastly, and probably my favorite, was the Fried Gulf Shrimp Po' Boy with Chipotle Remoulade.  The shrimp stayed crunchy and the bread was soft, but crisp on the inside. The watermelon iced tea was a nice treat too, if you really like watermelon.  It's a bit different.  Overall, great restaurant and I'd highly recommend it to everyone!

This place is a definite place to stop by when you get the chance. The line  was definitely long, waited for about an hour for a seat. Street parking wasn't too bad either. The beignets were delicious and fluffy, a perfect brunch alternative to say Mama's. The New Orleans French Corridor style was fun and charming. The best bet is to go on a weekday or order take-out to avoid the wait. Don't forget the watermelon ice tea!

So I decided to take my bf to this place to see whats all the hype about. My sister warned me about their crawfish beignet being too salty and she was right. We arrived there on a Saturaday morning and signed our name on the list about 11ish and did not get a seat til almost 1pm. While waiting patiently and reviewing what we want to eat we both decided to settle for the sampler Beignet, Sloppy Josephine and Oyster Po-Boy. and a Watermelon sweet tea. When the time has finally came, we sat down and service was just as what the other people had stated, they quickly give you a couple of mins and are back to asking "what would you like?"  Until my bf said i would like the Sloppy Josephine they said that we dont have that right now. Thinking that its lunch time already but i guess that menu is only for M-F lunch. So he just settle with the Egg and Bacon Tartine. At first when our Beignet came, it was huge. Hoping that as good as it look it would also taste great too. Nope. The apple cinnamon's beignet dough was tough. The chocolate Beignet was filled with lots of chocolate. The crawfish Beignet looked good when you cut it in half but as you put a piece in your mouth it was a little too salty for my taste. My bf's dish was not anything, more, special than with his eggs sitting on top of a french bread. My Oyster sandwich was delicious but the fries were too crunchy. Extremely hard and stiff. I usually like my fries crunchy but not to a point where i am struggling to chew or bite into it. Overall, it was Ok but i wouldnt say its the best.

I'm sorry to do this but I've had insanely good soul food in Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, Oakland, Chicago, and New York and this isn't it. Not by a long shot. After exploding reviews and a high yelp review count (and the fact that soul food is in the restaurant name), we decided to try this out. We settled on the beignets, gumbo, fried shrimp po' boy, and the sloppy josephine. Beignets (we ordered the savory versions) had a salty spice coating which really just threw me off. I should've ordered a sweet beignet but intrigued by the ingredients, I went with the savory. As soon as I bit into it, I had to send it back. Gumbo was pretty uneventful and the po' boy-- had better in Portland at a food cart. Sloppy Josephine was the worst insult of all. I wasn't the one to order it but if you're going to be sloppy joe on the menu- for the love of God, make it a little interesting and good. It tasted like the sloppy joes that are traditionally served at public school elementary cafeterias. I should know-- I used to love that growing up. Luckily, we went close to 2 pm during the week so we were seated relatively quickly which is great because, again, the food is not worth it. Watching tourists rifle through their Lonely Planet books and satisfactorily check this off their list just made me sad to think that some have claimed this as one of SF's finest.

The crawfish beignets are legit. Cool exposed-brick interior. I'm not into brunch, but if I had to go, I definitely wouldn't put up a fuss if someone suggested Brenda's.

Brenda's was a great. We tried that beignet sampler, the catfish po' boy, and the craw fish and andouille pot pie. The beignets were okay, a little bit denser than what I'm used to - the highlight, however, was the craw fish beignet, I could have eaten a bag of these! The po' boy was good, but just what you'd expect, nothing outstanding. The craw fish and andouille pot pie was delicious but a bit heavy. The 'pie' was a biscuit placed on top of the stew. The biscuit absorbed the sauce and was amazing. But then the whole thing was topped with melted cheddar, which was unnecessary and a bit too rich. The watermelon tea was perfectly balanced. This place is definitely worth visiting.

Went here my first time and order the crabcake beignets and shrimp po'boy. The beignets were seasoned really well. Didn't overpower the crabcake or blow out my palate. Shrimp po'boy was equally delicious. It was spicy, but at the same time the spiciness didn't overshadow the other flavors. - 1 star for customer service, while the service was generally nice (they refilled your water without asking, were attentive), it was near the end where i was slowly putting my hand up to ask for the check and i somehow got eye contact with one of the waitresses, but seeing that she was busy, I was almost about to turn around when she said (in the most condescending tone ever), "I'm busy with some customers right now. I'll be there when I'm done." (holding out here hand to tell me to stop) So yes. Food was great, but customer service needs a bit of work.

My boyfriend and I went to Brenda's about a month ago. Let me say that it was the best place I've ever been to!!! We had breakfast there. I had their Sweet Watermelon Tea, which is an iced tea with a kick of sweet watermelon. They even give you a watermelon hanging off the glass. My boyfriend and I both shared Beignets, which is french donut. It was filled with delicious melted chocolate. Sooo good. I had the Sweet Potato Pancakes with Pecan Syrup. Yummy!!! The Sweet Potato Pancakes were on special that day. The specials are written up on the "black board," which is really a mirror. Cool. My boyfriend had Pancakes (I forgot which ones.) He's were good too!!! It is a cozy little hole in the wall. My boyfriend had gone there once before with his classmates. The service was wonderful. The staff was really attentive. I plan on going back and taking my friends and family.

Thanks to my girlfriend Susie if she hadn't seen Brenda's on TV I would have never known about the yummy breakfast / brunch, & lunch served at Brenda's. We arrived very early, so the wait was only about 5 - 10 minutes. All worth the short wait. Started off with the chocolate stuffed beignets.....OMG yumdelish!!!! I highly recommend for those of you who are chocoholics. For our main dish I ordered the Eggs Benedict w/ maple ham. I a big fan of Eggs benedict and the eggs benedict @ Brenda's melts in your mouth. They don't serve it on your typical english muffin they served it on their homemade biscuits. Yum!  Hubby ordered the Banana's Fosters French Toast......YUMDELICIOUS for real! Banana's not over powering, the syrup was just right and to the side is the whip cream. Definitely coming back!

OMG!!!! Went to the city with my sweetie for a weekend of relaxation so we were in no hurry, and its a good thing ... We stood on the side of Polk street in San Francisco for 2 hours... yes that's right 2 hours waiting to get into the place, let alone for our breakfast. But let me make myself very clear here, it was worth every min of tummy grumbles standing out on the side walk... Let me spell out why. CRAWFISH BEIGNETS!!!!! I love Beignets, and have found no one who does it right,  until now... everything we ate was to die for, but oh how I am still dreaming about that crisp, soft, savory, spicy, cheesey cloud of wonderful that is the "Beignet"

I am one of those people who tends to think of ambience and service as technicalities; it's a rare restaurant with waiters and atmosphere bad enough to interfere with my enjoyment of a good meal.   In Brenda's case, I'll make an exception.   The food, I will say right now, is terrific; authentic and mouthwatering "French soul food" with a Lou'siana accent.  I particularly recommend the crawfish beignet for the adventurous.  Top-flight coffee, too.  (My fella was not as impressed with the food; he enjoyed the sweet beignets, though.) However, the food was bookended and interrupted with what I can only imagine are Brenda's attempts at "character": a slow-moving waiting line that forms outside (yes, out on the sidewalk on Polk Street in the shadow of a Taco Bell), a rude and condescending server, a smothering crowd, and a couple of rickety seats at a "counter" that was really more like a couple of 2x4s. This. Is. Not. Charming.  In fact, it loses you my business, Brenda.  In slightly nicer digs, with slightly nicer employees, this could have been a fantastic dining experience.  Instead, I can't recommend this place in good conscience.

Oh Brenda's. Despite your long wait in the drizzling rain this morning, you were fantastic. Hailing from New Orleans roots, I had high expectations for this French Southern Cuisine.  I was not disappointed. I ordered the fired chicken eggs benedict, on a biscuit.  It must have been about a million calories, but when that buttery hollandaise sauce melts in your mouth- you don't mind a bit.  It had a little Cajun kick at the end which was the perfect temper to it's rich base.  The biscuit was out of this world- dusted in light cornmeal I think, providing just enough crunch. The cheese grits- nice and creamy.  I put a bit of the Grillades gravy into mine and I highly recommend that little addition.   I tried only a bit of the Grillades and the Gumbo.  Neither are quite like my Grandmere's but they're a great substitute for a homesick college student.  I think even she would approve.  The price point isn't bad at all- especially for the portion sizes. The team at Brenda's seems to all work together nicely, they keep the place friendly and efficient. The decor is sparse, but the kitchen (based on my nosy musings) looked very very clean.   I'll definitely be back again and in the meantime, i'm sending all my friends!

I went here on a weekday with some friends for an early lunch.  I was warned of the long waits that start during the lunch rush because it's such a small restaurant.  Fortunately, we got there early enough where our wait was only about 20 minutes. Parties of 2 got seated more quickly, but since we were a party of 5 it took a little bit to wait for 2 smaller parties to leave and make a table that could accommodate us.   The staff was pleasant and really accommodating.  It was spring break so it was me my friends and their 2 little girls and I was a little nervous about how the restaurant would handle a party with 2 little ones that quickly get restless, but all went smoothly and the waitress was really nice and patient with us.   Here's our food breakdown: Watermelon Sweet Tea - I loved it! It was refreshing with the subtle hint of watermelon in a sweet tea that wasn't too sugary sweet. Flight of Beignets - We shared this among the table and I have to say it wasn't one of their stronger dishes.  The beignets were a lot more dense than I would prefer.  They had more of a doughnut consistency than the light airy beignets I'm accustomed to. They were tasty, but I would save space in my belly for the other excellent dishes they serve up. Oyster Po' Boy - Oysters were fresh with a perfectly light batter, not greasy at all. The roll was nice and soft on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside.  I couldn't ask for a better Po' Boy outside of NOLA. Muffuletta - This was the special for the day and it was good, but not the best among the various items we selected.  I would say the bread was the weak link.  But definitely a tasty sandwich. Seafood Fry Basket - A basket full of fried seafood goodness! All the seafood was definitely fresh and perfectly breaded and fried to perfection. Hush puppies were the perfect not too sweet and not too crumby texture. BFC - OMG BEST FRIED CHICKEN. I've had some pretty darn good fried chicken since I went to college in the south, but Brenda's definitely brought the south to SF! It had a perfect crunch, incredibly juicy, and not overly greasy. I loved that they served pickled watermelon rinds with all the entrees. Made me miss being back east where I used to go on day trips for southern comfort food. Overall, the fried items were done well and there is no question that everything is made fresh.  I will definitely have to come back to order all the other mouthwatering dishes I didn't get to try this time around.

Delicious! Great Service, I had a grand time! We went on Sat morning, put our name on the chalk board and only waited for 15 mins, not bad considering there is ALWAYS a line out there... I had Mocha, perhaps a bit too much chocolate, but still fine. For eats, I ordered the fried catfish eggs Benedict and the Three thick slices of cinnamon-battered toast, topped with powdered sugar Top with warm, buttery toasted pecan sauce Partner had Hangtown Fried....equally as tasty! The only drawback is it is in a sketchy area and even at 10am in the morning there were people tweaking.

My friend and I came here for a post-half-marathon calorie fix. Brenda's gave us much more than that. Service: Okay. We goofed. We thought after putting our name in, we had enough time to get some warmth at Peet's. When we got back, our name was passed and crossed out. I tried to explain our snaffu to the person in charge of the list. She was really apologetic when she said that we had to put our name back on the end of the list. She was so sweet about it. We were totally guilty of not adhering to the protocol - I just was amazed that she didn't give me any 'tude when I tried to state our case. When our name was called, she apologized to me again and thanked us for waiting. The service remained wonderful once we sat down - she knew we were ready and took our order as our butts hit the surface of the chairs. We were oh-so-thankful. They also voluntarily gave us clean plates throughout the meal and did everything with a smile. Love that. Now the food. OHHHHHH, the food! Since we had a decent amount of time to be Peeping Toms from the outside while waiting, we were aware that the portions were far larger than that of other brunch places. We also saw the size of the 'Flight of Beignets' (which we knew was a MUST to order) so we opted to just share a main course. What a good move that was! We both still left there beyond full and eating more than we needed to (and keep in mind that we are two hungry girls normally...let alone after running 13 miles!). Now a breakdown of our food: Crawfish beignet: Amazing. A slight kick yet a slight sweetness to it. Yum, yum, yum! Could have eaten these alone...but why miss out on the variety??? Plain beignet: Between the powdered sugar and the homemade strawberry jam on the table, simple and delicious. At this point, we decided the other ones would make great 'brunch dessert'. They offered us a bag to take them home in but we told them our plan (we were both going our separate ways after brunch - we would have both had to have taken one each...and there was no way we were not going to both sample each and every beignet). They brought a smaller plate to make more room on the table. Shrimp and goat cheese omelette with caramelized onions and potato hash: Mmmmm! The caramelized onions gave it a sweetness that is much beloved by me. It was also great to take put a bit of the potato hash on my fork at the same time - so dee-lish together. Biscuit: I'm not typically a biscuit girl. Most of the time they are way too dense. Not here! Light as a freakin' feather. And with that homemade jam - no need to say more! Apple beignet: Definite nutmeg flavor. The apples weren't crunchy and nor were they soft. I liked it but I could understand if it wasn't somebody's favorite. Chocolate beignet: Ooey gooey chocolate coming out from the beignet. I live for chocolate. Definitely meant to be the last thing eaten before leaving the restaurant. Could make for a good nighttime dessert, too. Both of us can't wait to come here again. I can't wait to bring my foodie friends here. I can't wait to bring my sister and brother-in-law here. We both agreed it's one of our top SF brunch spots. We both also agreed that we are going to have mid-week fantasies about this meal again...

After making it to the gym a whole two mornings this week, I decided to reward myself with a trip to Brenda's. It negated my workouts ten times over, but man was it worth it. We started with the Granny Smith Apple Beignets (they bring you three) and were full before our other orders arrived (Eggs Benedict and the Egg &Bacon Tartine). Everything was delish - Get the grits, which are much better than the potato hash, duh. Minus one for the hour wait out in the rain-ish and cold...but hey, a whole sidewalk full of shivering peeps can't be wrong, right?

If you don't like this place, you don't know what the _____ you are talking about when it comes to food. Brenda, your restaurant rocks.  Amazing hangtown fry, the oysters took me right back to NOLA; the crawfish and cheddar beignets are a revelation.  Biscuits so light and fluffy you'd swear that they were made of angels' wings and grits that will make you see Jesus. Well done, you are to be congratulated on your success and we'll be back.

Repeat after me..O..M.G..! The food is so darn good! The bf and i visited on a Sat for an early dinner (6-ish). We had to wait about 1/2 an hour for a table. We ordered the: Crawfish Beignets , Hushpuppies,Shrimp & Grits & Cornmeal-fried Shrimp Po'boy. We've been to NOLA and we thought the food was just as good in this SF restaurant. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The neighborhood is a little questionable, but not super sketchy. I didn't give it 5 stars because the wait staff was ok.

I've been here 5 times now and I love it. - it's small - they don't take reservations which means you don't really have to plan too far ahead - there's a list, i.e. you don't have to wait there, just put your name down and go to Philz on Van Ness Menu recommendations: - watermelon tea (made with real watermelon) - beignets (anything but plain; crawfish if you're feeling adventurous) - eggs benedict (brunch only; cajun hollandaise is the best) - grits - biscuits Service has always been good for me. If you come with a large group, you'll have to wait a while, but they'll likely be able to seat you eventually. Bathroom is through the tiny kitchen.

I have been walking past this place for months on my way out of my neighborhood saying, Oh man! I keep forgetting that's there!"  Today I planned for it, woke up hungry and headed out for breakfast.  I was so pleased.  The place is tiny (8 tables and some counter; don't forget to write your name on the clip-pad before getting in line outside), but the wait was not terrible.   There were two of us.  We both had coffee (rich, with chicory) and thought since it's our first time here, we better try the beignets along with our breakfast- fully knowing we would never be able to eat it all!   We ordered the granny smith apple beignets.  What I liked best about them was that they weren't over-the-top-in sweetness.  Quite good.  I had the Creole Veggie Omlette (corn, spinach, tomatoes, cheese, onions) with a side of grits (oh my!!) and a cream biscuit.  It's a good thing they do doggie bags: the beignets and biscuit came home with me!  Chris had french toast with pecan sauce.  Also, a perfect, will-not-make-you-pass-out amount of sweet.  It all came to $32.  How reasonable!

Wow, we waited over an hour for a table and the wait was worth every minute.  It did help that it was an unusually warm Saturday morning with the sun shining and barely a breeze in the air. Once we got inside, we got our tiny table for two for the three of us.  We didn't complain though as even the tables for four had five or six people sitting at them.  The joint is small, noisy, and crowded, just like some of the best places we've visited in New Orleans. We started with two orders of beignets - one chocolate, one apple.  The chocolate were delicious, the apple were OK.  Both were a little on the tough and chewy side though. Finally our main breakfast dishes arrived.  My partner and his son ordered the French Toast.  Delicious slices of bread smothered in brown sugar coated pecans. I had the andouille sausage omelet.   It was moist and all so flavorful.  Accompanied by the best potato hash my taste buds have ever encountered.  And a huge biscuit that was so light it was like eating cumulus nimbus clouds of delight. Get there really early to avoid a long line.  But even if there is a wait don't give up, your taste buds will thank you.

Came after tennis with a couple friends on a Sunday afternoon to find a crowd of people already waiting. We put our name on the list and proceeded with the 1 hr+ wait, as we scoped out a good-looking guy who was there with his girlfriend. :( Gumbo: 4 stars Omelette (forgot which kind): 4 stars Biscuit (even though I don't like them much): 4 stars Cafe au Lait: 5 stars And had something else (ah, darn my memory) with grits. Grits were ok: 3 stars But overall good. Food makes up for the wait and not as good parts of the food (which were few). Good looking guy and food together make up for the wait as well. Not perfect...so I have to give 4 stars. Mmmm Cafe au Lait sounds so good right now. Bon appetit, mes amis!! Can someone put their name on the list for me and call me up when the wait is over, so I can just come for the yummy goodness minus the wait outside in the cold (sun didn't help much with the wind), unless there are some good specimens to rest my eyes on. ;-)

I came here on a Sunday morning with two friends around 10am in the morning and there was no line. We ordered: Crawfish beignets, Andouille Omelette, buttermilk pancake with blueberries and watermelon tea. The beignets is similar to a potpie with crawfish deliciously baked with melted cheddar cheese inside a crispy enclosed crust. The audouille omelette was cooked to perfection--moist and delicious--with sausage, cheddar and mushroom. The pancake was okay with fresh blueberries. I ordered the watermelon tea to refresh my tastebuds after eating greasy food. The service here is good too. The food came out pretty quickly and the waiter kept on coming around with refills of the watermelon tea, coffee and water. Good food combined with good service = coming back for more.

What can I really say about French food anyway?  I open my mouth and the little French Devil that sits on my shoulder tells me to shut up and eat my cheese, and put more butter on my brioche.  I always end up following its commands, mostly out of the fear that I'll wake up one morning with white makeup covering my face and my vocal chords cut.   Sometimes i felt like i was going to get cut at Brenda's as well.  Or slapped for asking for more water.  Or perhaps kicked for looking at the waiting list.  But you know what, it was all worth it for the Cajun beignets.  They are quite amazing - and memorable, which are two things I always look for in good food.   My second time to Brenda's, I braved the uneven, temperamental wind of San Francisco, waiting for about an hour for a table to open up.  It was my own fault for waiting until ten in the morning to get there.  Its a pretty small joint after all.  I over ordered the heck out of that menu, taking home four beignets and 75% of my grits and gravy combo.  Man!  What leftovers they were though!  I had a mini-French fantasy the next morning - pretending I was somewhere in the French countryside laughing at Americans, and drinking red wine from the barrel.   Turns out my lady had rearranged the furniture in the den so that the mirror was opposite my armchair, and I had picked up a bottle of two buck chuck.   The coffee is strong, the women are stronger, and the experience is quite unique.

This place is well deserving of 5 stars and not because I rounded up from a 4.5 to a 5. Don't get me wrong, I love rounding up. I'm one of those tippers who always rounds up to the nearest dollar just to get a whole number total. Very few things with this much hype live up to their expectations. But Brenda's is one of those exceptions along with Tickle Me Elmo and Heely's skate shoes. This is definitely a 5 star restaurant through and through. I've been to Brenda's French Soul Food a handful of times and each time I leave satisfied and wanting more! This place is always packed and there is always a long line of people waiting outside. It's pretty amazing that a group of people are willing to brave the dangers of the TL just for a bite of deliciousness. (The danger of the TL might be exaggerated for literary effect). I have never actually dined in at this place; the line is just too intimidating. I only order take out, but it works for me. Shoot I remember one time I parked my car, went to pick up my food, went back to my car, popped open my trunk and ate out of there. The food is just too good not to devour right away. I've eaten the Croque Moniseur (delicious ham sandwich with gruyere cheese and a bechamel sauce) and the fried Oyster Po Boy sandwich (what more can be said than fried oysters!!). For dessert, I always go for the beignets. I recommend the beignet flight as it gives you a sampling of each flavor. I am quite fond of the crawfish beignet and the chocolate beignet. The crawfish version is a nice twist on the traditional sweet beignet; it is savory and spicy. And the chocolate beignet oozes molten chocolate with each bite. I'm no expert on authentic Southern comfort food. Heck, I've never been to the South let alone New Orleans. All I know of New Orleans are the pan overs of the Hollygrove projects in Lil Wayne music videos. But I will make the gigantic leap and say that this is as close to authentic soul food as you can get in San Francisco.

Let's cut through the pleasantries shall we? This place is friggin' awesome. The crawfish beignets for delicious from first bite to last. The fried oyster po' boy was delicious. Even though the oysters in the sandwich were deep fried I didn't feel weighed down after eating it. It was also served with a side of slaw which was probably the best I've ever had. There's usually a long line for this place but it's well worth the wait. 4 stars all the way baby!

Eggs bacon tartine- eggs are fluffy, potatoes are perfectly seasoned. but a snoozer dish Oyster po'boys- oysters are perfectly fried.  YUM! Crawfish Beignets- not diggin it.  Too much dough and not enough gooey goodness.  Lay off that chili powder too! Watermelon ice tea- delish! service- BLAH

Tried dining here on a late Sunday morning, but had to pass.  My sister warned  us about arriving early because there's usually a long wait. We ended up arriving close to noon. Surely enough, there was a long line. Looking at the waiting list, there were about twenty tables ahead of us. The restaurant is fairly small with a few tables and a bar top with stools, so  we didn't bother to wait and left. The next day, I decided to give this place another shot hoping there wouldn't be a long wait on a Monday morning. We arrived at 11am and waited about five minutes before being seated. After reading reviews on yelp as well as my sister recommending this place, I was anxious to try out this place out. Our order: Beignet Flight               8.00 (breakfast menu) Croque Monsieur         9.00 (lunch menu) Fried Oyster Po-boy     9.50 (lunch menu) Watermelon ice tea     2.00 Cafe au lait                    2.25 We ordered the beignet flight to get a little taste of each listed on the menu. It came with one plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, and crawfish dusted with powdered sugar . We started with the plain, crawfish and saved the sweeter ones for last. The crawfish was pretty tasty, but could have been better if there were more crawfish. The granny smith apple was a bit on the dry side (not oozy as stated on the menu) and semi-sweet, while the chocolate was just way too sweet for my taste. For a moment, I thought I was biting into nutella  when in fact it was Ghirardelli chocolate( guess I'm not a huge fan of chocolate to begin with).   The Po-boy  was a lightly battered fried oyster sandwich with sauce on a toasted French roll with French fries on the side. It was quite tasty. However, the Croque Monsieur wasn't anything special at all. It tasted like a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. The only difference was, it was crunchier and a bit better than your typical grilled ham and cheese sandwich. As far as our drinks, there was nothing great about the watermelon ice tea or the Cafe au lait. Overall,  the food is fairly decent, though it may take a while before your order arrives. The plain and crawfish beignets as well as the Po-boy sandwich was delicious.  Wait staff were friendly. Cleanliness isn't so great, but can be tolerable for some  and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  I recommend early arrival to avoid the long wait typically on weekends. If I happen to be in town, I would definitely come back again for their beignets  and try other items on the menu. However, I probably wouldn't want to wait no more than half an hour to dine here. So far, this place gets three and a half stars.

DAMMMMMMNNNN GINA! This place is smack yo mamma good! We were going to eat at a spot near our hotel but the line was out the door and around the corner.  We found Brenda's on yelp and were told that they currently didn't have a wait but that could change.   When we arrived we snagged the last table. We couldn't decide everything looked scrumptious! I had the pecan french toast and Alice had some sandwich with grits.  it was good.   We wanted the Beignets and catfish like I said everything looked so good it was hard to make up your mind but we will be back!

I have to say, I am one lucky woman- Brenda is my sister in law! I've been reluctant to post a review for that reason, but I was given the green light, so there you go! Needless to say I'm not entirely impartial, but I should mention that I live in Chicago and the few times I've been to Brenda's, I've had the same experience everyone else has had (YES, including waiting in line- no special treatment here!) with of course the exception that Brenda takes 2 seconds out of her busy morning to give me a hug before we go.. :) MY favorite dishes so far have been the grits and grillades and the granola pancakes with vanilla cream... DELISH. The grits were in particular new to me as I am an Iowa girl, but they were so creamy and buttery... and wow. Her biscuits. Jesus. These things should be illegal. Best I've ever had, in my entire life, seriously. Then paired with her homemade jam? YES, please.   I also LOVE that Brenda serves chicory coffee. Again, we don't really do chicory in Chicago, but we should- I like my coffee dark and strong. And the beignets- YUM. What can I say that hasn't already been said? I can't wait to try the rest of the menu and see the new space- I'm jealous of all you SF regulars. And please keep posting reviews to that I can live vicariously through you... I know that this restaurant has been Brenda's dream come true, so thanks for making it such a success. In the meantime, I remain, the Midwest Marketing Director. If only it were a paid position...

Brenda's is a tiny lil place in the TL...get there late and you'll face a wait. It has about 9 or 10 tables and 8 seats at the counter; I would say it holds about 35-40 people. If they offer you a seat at the counter, I highly suggest you take it, as you might be waiting quite a while for a table!! Whatever you choose, I think it's worth the wait: We started off the the beignet flight. I would say this had mixed results. The fillings were very good. My issue relates to the dough. I found it much too dense and almost over-fried, particularly with the filled beignets. The Chocolate beignet was very good, with copious amounts of smooth chocolate filling the center. And the apple...it was delightfully permeated with cinnamon. However, I had a hard time biting these (really), particularly on the edges. Ditto for the crawfish, which was filled with cheese and green onions as well. The crawfish had one additional problem...it tasted to me as if they used the same dough for this savory beignet, and relied on an attempt to overspice the outside of the beignet to cover it up! I may be mistaken though, as I am no connoisseur. The plain beignet was delicious (my dining partner thought this was also dense, but I liked it just the way it was). Egg and Bacon Tartine: Ahh, my very first bite (the corner) tasted like brioche french toast. Two slices of bacon under the egg made me a happy camper. And the potato hash? Delicious. Creamy. Just a touch of spice. Admittedly, I didn't have much of the tartine, as I was too busy mooching some of the..... Fried Shrimp Po-boy: O.M.G. Tons of fried shrimp on this. The chipotle rémoulade is REALLY good on it too. I don't know how else to explain it, but I'll try. The crispness of the bread and shrimp worked well together, and somehow the tomato offset this with a bit of lightness (perhaps it was helped with the tomato's acidity). YUM! We got this with the fries, which were good, but pretty run-of-the-mill. This is on the Lunch Menu, which they weren't handing out even though it's served all day, so look for it on the menu posted outside. I also had the House Watermelon Sweet Tea. I liked it, and I am not usually one for iced teas. I would suggest getting it with a little less ice though. As we were finishing, I saw a plate coming out of the kitchen with a cream biscuit on it. Mental note to try it next time. It looked positively delicious!! Service was okay. It's a really small place though, so I guess it's more understandable if they don't come around quite so much (we were sitting at the counter and it was quite a squeeze), and they seem nice enough. Would have gotten more points if they had come around to offer a refill of coffee, as we saw them at other tables (about three feet away). Parking (meters) was not difficult. 4.5 stars. The food was good and it seemed like the portions were huge. Filled beignets are hard to do, I would imagine, so I'll cut them some slack. However, I got icked out a bit cause I did notice fruit flies.

Jump back, kiss myself! I had brunch at Brenda's this morning with two gal pals and the three phrases that stick out in my head from our conversation during the meal are, "holy crap, that's good!", "these biscuits are insane; how do they do that?" and "next time I come here I am going to get a heaping plate of beignets and biscuits with four slices of bacon criss-crossed over the top for protein."  That final statement was mine, and I stand by it. I don't care about the wait. I don't care about the cramped quarters. I don't care about the mounds of poo on the sidewalk outside.  I don't even care that I was almost drop-kicked into a fecal pile when trying to put my name on the waiting list hanging outside the entrance by an apparently ravenous couple.  This place rocks.

My favorite, favorite place for brunch in the City.  Really. Though it's tiny, and lines are long, it's worth the wait. My favorites: Savory:  Crawfish beignets with cayenne, scallions and cheddar, gumbo, egg and bacon tartine (the accompanying bacon-tomato relish is divine); Sweet:  Cinnamon-battered french toast, topped with warm, buttery toasted pecan sauce, granny smith apple beignets, with cinnamon honey butter. My ex and I would come here regularly on the weekends.  After the breakup, I got custody of Brenda's.  I'd much rather have Brenda's than the ex.  Also, the most expensive item on the menu is $10.50, so it won't break the bank. The lines die down quite a bit after 1pm, so try to plan your trip for between then and 3pm when they close.

Came here at 2pm on a sunday and there was no wait. Everything we tried was very unique: crawfish beignet, watermelon iced tea, grits, and a more traditional breakfast item. I think they're all worth trying once, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, esp. given the long wait at regular hours.

We went here on a holiday and the wait was pretty long.  This place gets crowded so make sure you're not starving and prepare.  The shrimp and grits and the crawfish beignets are to die for. If you like southern food you should definitely try this place.  Also, they were packed but the service was still pretty good.

Ummm...that was good brunch!  Location is a bit odd, but its a cute lil place with great food and attentive wait staff.   Saturday 11am, 6 parties ahead of us and = 30 min wait.  Order included the egg & bacon tartine, and the shrimp and goat cheese omelette.  The plain beignet looked better than it tasted, next time maybe Ill try the other beignets.  Im going back, and am happy to give Brendas 4 full ones.

Gooooood stuff.  Lots of it on a plate.  Too much to eat right there, so you've got to take it home.  But, that's okay, you get two meals that day for the price of one. Who cares that sometimes you have to wait on a Saturday morning in the cold with the slight stench of Friday night's TL victim's upchuck just off the curb?  It's cool...watermelon iced tea awaits.  And biscuits to slap your momma for.

I have been DYING to try this place. But during the week lacked time or company to go do it with. I finally got there. I wanted to go during the week because I wanted a poboy which didn't appear on the weekend menu, although our super sweet waiter told me that there is a different poboy on the weekends - that varies. The neighborhood is a little rough and the wait was long. While we were standing outside a woman walked by and said, it's worth the wait. She was right. We started with the flight of beniet's. WOW. I wasn't excited about the craw fish beniet - but that was my favorite! And I don't generally love craw fish. After that I had the fried oyster poboy. I was in heaven. The first bite was magical. So, the place is tiny and packed but totally worth the wait. I LOVED it and will go back again!

I was super duper lucky to have a friend pick up breakfast from Brenda's and bring it to my house for breakfast! I heard from her that the line was out the door... So we had a bag of goodies (beignets of all sorts chocolate, apple and something spicy), french toast and their gumbo.  All were delicious. Sadly to say, I've never had a beignet before and it was sinfully good. True it was probably a thousand calories. The gumbo was also delicious and I liked the sausage and chicken in it. It wasn't super spicy either. Maybe one day I'll brave the line and eat at the restaurant, but it's really nice to have someone bring it to you!

I was very excited before we ate, but I was pretty bummed when I left Brenda's. I was really looking forward to my breakfast, but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We waited for about an hour, which I have no complaint about because I know this place is popular. When we were seated I got a coffee which was delicious (Community coffee! from my hometown of Baton Rouge). Then the beignet sampler, which was really nothing like traditional beignets. I like that they were experimenting, and the crawfish beignet was good, but the rest were really tough and not light or fluffy. My boyfriend got the grillades and grits which were amazing (wish I got it) and I got the egg and bacon tartine. Womp womp. Just like scrambled eggs with pieces of bacon on half a piece of french bread. Oh well, at least I know what to recommend to people.

Definitely wait the hour and half wait even on a rainy day!! I went with a bunch of good girlfriends, so now I have to take my husband there.  Cute little soul food brunch cafe.  Their watermelon ice tea was SOOOOO good.  I think i had three glasses.  Then we tried their fried oyster omelet.  I'm normally not a huge fried oyster fan, but they cut it in smaller pieces with bacon and of course i love eggs.  Very interesting.  But wait... their french toast was just DELISH.  It can almost be your dessert with the butter pecan sauce.  I"m such a happy camper afterwards.  Definitely a place to try for anyone visiting sf. What's even better is while you're waiting you can walk around the corner and you are in little saigon.  Go get a Lee's sandwich if you are starving or some boba at Quicklys!

FINALLY, I did it.. I waited an hour to try Brenda's! The food is fresh, hot, and delicious. By the end meal, you realize the wait was worth it. The juice is worth the squeeze!  I recommend: (+) Shrimp and Cheese Grits: Usually, I don't really care for grits, but this was unbelievable. It changed my mind because it was full of cajun spice and really cheesy. May be a bit too cheesy, but I love the flavor. (+) Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelet: The shrimp was not over cooked and the amount of goat cheese in the omelet is not excessive. I especially love the touch of tomato bacon relish--that's a money maker right there. (+) Watermelon ice tea: I would highly recommend getting it because it's not overwhelmingly sweet. I also like that it's not that generic watermelon flavor. This drink is refreshing and washes all the hearty cajun food nicely.

Brunch of dreams. The star of the show is, without exception the crawfish Beignet, a ridiculously good pastry stuffed with sweet and spicy fresh crawfish and cheese. impossible to go wrong with that. Also tried a fried catfish Benedict, and a very nice Bloody Mary. The atmosphere here is casual and open, but while the cracked concrete walls lend a nice aesthetic, they make it virtually impossible to hear. I feel old and cranky saying so, but if I can been able to hear the waiter, I would definitely have gone with the grits instead of the fried potatoes. As it was, I found myself just sort of smiling and nodding. Though noted for the wait, it actually wasn't so bad. We put our names on the list and wandered down to civic center to have a look at the giant flower outside the Asian Art Museum, arriving back at the restaurant just in time for our table. Still, the lack of a reservation option is a big deterrent for larger parties. I'd love to come here with a group of friends, but I don't really feel like its practicable.

We were looking for some good birthday lunch on our way through the city to a day of nature.  It was during lunch rush so we decided just to order take out.  We got our food very timely and the shrimp pot pie in a to-go cup was surprisingly not awkward to eat and full of little shrimps! I can't wait to go back for their beignet flight!

Ate here on a Saturday and just so you're not moded, write your name down on the clipboard near the door and don't walk inside for a table. I didn't walk inside but as the waitress was coming out, I told her I wanted a table for two and she said, "just write your name down on the list". What an amateur, she must've thought. Anyways, my boyfriend and I waited about 25 minutes for a seat at the little bar against the wall, equipped with a mirror so when you get down with the powder and crawfish beignet, you can check you lips to see if you look like Dave Chappelle's Tyrone. Service was prompt, we ordered the beignet flight because we couldn't decide. The flight gives you get one of each. My favorite was the og one with powdered sugar and then the crawfish. Don't waste your time on the apple, the chocolate was just ok. I've never been to New Orleans or had a real authentic beignet but it tasted good to me! Boyfriend ordered one of the specials, Hangtown Fry, a scramble with oyster and bacon. My dream come true!!! It's served with the corn grits...mouthgasm bigtime. I ordered the egg and bacon tartine which was just okay. It actually tasted better as leftovers later that night. The servings are generous. I think the total tab came out to about 40 bucks. It's a small joint with limited table space, so don't bring homework or your big hat or all your shopping parcels with you. If waiting is just one of those things in life that you absolutely will not do, I suggest eating here on a weekday or arrive before 10:30 on a weekend but eating at Brenda's is definitely one of those things in life that you must absolutely do.

Came here with 9 other folks and they don't take reservations. So we planned ahead and got there at 5:00pm. I wrote my name on their waiting list chalkboard, and as our party of 10 started arriving, they sat us with about 6 people which was nice. We all brought wine, and corkage was $10 per bottle which was very reasonable. No wine glasses, just small drinking glasses, which was fine, much easier to handle. A woman next to us was eating the stuffed pork chop special, looked unbelievable. Her friend was eating the shrimp and grits, also terrific. A few weeks ago, I had their shrimp and grits for brunch. Grits are amazingly creamy, shrimp is so fresh and in my mind the right amount, the melted cheese really sets it apart, and the tomato sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but still excellent. Strangely, I didn't think this was the kind of dish my wife would enjoy. Boy was I wrong. Appetizers - we ordered 5 crawfish beignets. Those are a must-have. I think anyone from kids to the pickiest of adults would enjoy these. Cheese, crawfish, and flavor wrapped in a deep fried ball of dough. Whaaaaat!!! I will say sharing a beignet with your spouse just doesn't feel right, like I'm playing a bait and switch on my taste buds. But my stomach knows we must be patient, more to come. Hushpuppies with a creamy mayo dressing. Outstanding. Pork rillettes (pate) spread on a crouton with this one-of-a-kind mustard. So good. If you don't like pate because it's too gamey or fatty or strange, you have to give this a try. I'm drinking wine, and my wife is drinking a watermelon iced tea. I wanted the wine, but if I wasn't drinking that night, the iced tea is the way to go. A very mellow flavor, not sweet at all, and so refreshing. Two other people had it and glad they ordered it. Most of us had the stuffed pork chop and shrimp and grits. One person had the fried chicken. Long story short on the stuffed pork chop with side of mashed sweet potatoes and green beans, covered in gravy. If I could have that every Thanksgiving for the rest of my life, I would never eat turkey again. No offense to turkey and turkey lovers, but it was that good. My wife, who doesn't usually eat everything, nearly finished the gigantic shrimp and grits, and this is with trying plenty of other dishes. Krazee good. A great night out, and the food was a huge part of it.

I went here with two other friends on Father's Day--which should've tipped us off that it might be crowded, but we went on that day anyways. One thing about this place is that the wait can get pretty crazy. First of all, there was already a crowd when we got there, and secondly, when I wrote our name down, there were two and a half columns of names ahead of us. I knew then that it was going to a pretty damn long wait--2 hours in fact. But everything went pretty smooth once we got seated! We ordered the Beignet Flight and all of them were great, but my favorite is definitely the crawfish beignet. I recommend skipping the others and just order that one instead. Ordered the Egg & Bacon Tartine--wasn't mindblowing, but I like breakfast foods and it was good enough to keep me happy. Lastly, I also had the Sweet Watermelon House Tea. I wasn't sure if I had liked it at first (since it wasn't what I was expecting) but since I drank two glasses of it, I guess I must've! Overall, I'm actually somewhere between a 3 and a 4 stars with Brenda's.  Service was just fine, it's just the waiting time that gets really crazy. But! They do have good food here, and if that's what you're looking for and you don't mind having to wait, then this place can probably satisfy you.

The GF and i checked this place out before the Red Bull Soap Box Derby last weekend. Now i must mention that my family is from Beaumont in East Texas, and once you get east of Houston (the city in which i grew up), you might as well be in Louisiana. I grew up eating grits, hash, and beignets and my grandma's house so expectations were way high. The walk through the tenderloin at 8:30 on a saturday morning sure was interesting, but once we got there we were seated immediately (it seemed like the line really started to build starting around 9am). The beignet flight included plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish. Each was perfect in its own unique way. The GF is from Oklahoma, so she wasn't feeling the crawfish one too much, but i LOVED it. Definitely order this if you go. I got an order of grits, because being a southerner i can't say no. They were perfect. Buttery, a little cheesey, and smooth enough to be nice. They were grainy enough to remind you that you were eating grits and not mashed potatoes, but not so grainy that it was like a mouthful of sand. They were just about perfect. My GF got an order of the potato hash. I had a few bites and it was fabulous. Enough seasoning to make things interesting, but not enough to hide the potatoes. We split an order of bacon and anduille sausage. The bacon was bacon, delicious and crispy, but not too much so. The anduille sausage was also pleasantly spicy, but again, not too much so. Not too fatty, but just a tad greasy. Once again, just about perfect. It was really the perfect breakfast. I just couldn't wipe the shit eating grin off my face, it felt like being right back at grandma's. I wish this place was closer to home, but on second thought, for the health of my heart, maybe its a good thing that it takes some effort to get there. Otherwise, i might be there every saturday morning instead of out on my bike. This is certainly my new favorite b-fast spot in the city.

OOOOOOOH CHILDDDD, this place rocked my socks off! After hearing much hype from my roommate, we decided to go for lunch. The interior was small, crowded, homey, and cute. Very lively inside. The waitresses were all super nice, giving me great recommendations for my first time. It was so hard to decide on what to order but I managed to single it down to the basics: gumbo, beignets, and biscuits. After having some coffee and juice everything arrived. It was hot, flavorful, and comforting. Ohhh lawdy! I have finally found heaven in biscuit form! Buttery, flakey, soft, and delicioussss. The beignets were AMAZING. Not too heavy but full of sweet goodness. The gumbo was one of the best I've ever had, flavorful, spicy, and hearty. YUM!!!

Best part of this yelp:  Chocolate beignets are AWESOME.  Gumbo = GOOD.  Unlimited watermelon iced tea.  Never heard of it and it was delicious.  I'm going to make some at home. I usually don't like gumbo, but Brenda's' gumbo is GOOD. My cuz and I came here for brunch and missed it!  We walked by this line of people and figured it was something else... but no.  It was the waiting line for Brenda's. This is not a fancy restaurant...  It's more like a very popular hole-in-the-wall diner.  We shared a gumbo (really good), a chocolate beignet,  Croque Monseir (baked ham and gruyère with bechamel sauce on sliced sourdough) which was on their brunch menu, and the Egg and Bacon Tartine (bacon, scrambled egg, gruyère on toasted French roll).  Everything literally was like a french meal, but soul food.  It is what it serves! Everyone there enjoyed the food and it's a definite San Francisco treat!

3.5 stars After eating a delicious lunch here, I would never have guessed that Ms. Brenda was filipino.   Her food is delicious and authentic.  I never knew that beignets can come stuffed with chocolate too.  Make sure you make room to finish off your meal with this sweet treat. I went on a weekday for lunch.  The place is quite "cozy" so be prepared for a wait or come early and beat the rush. For lunch I had the gumbo which was good although, when I was in NoLA, my gumbo was a bit thicker in consistency and less broth-y.  The house salad sounds dull but was really great with a light mustard dressing. The special of the day was jambalaya and what a hearty portion they give.  This was served along side a green salad which was a nice balance. My only gripe about this place which knocked off 1/2 a star was that it was slow.  Slow like molasses.  I know the joint is small but if the table service was a bit faster then the wait for tables wouldn't be so long. Either way, I'd give this place another chance to make it to 4 stars.

Pros: Everything I ate there was great (veggie omelet, deep fried oyster sandwich, pork chop, beignet, and gumbo).  We couldn't decide which beignet we wanted so ordered sampler, and my favorite was (were?) crawfish and chocolate.  Kinda wish they have Nutella beignet... Service was good as well, and they are very prompt and polite.  We had little accident (found something in our food) was it was taken care very quickly and properly. Cons: Wait - we waited little over an hour, I think.  1.5 hour tops. Size - we were seated at counter, and it was just so tight and cramped.  It was almost uncomfortable to eat because my elbow would touch others as I ate.  Restaurant itself has very limited seating.  I suggest party of 3 or more to get a table.   Neighborhood - expect to see LOTS of bums while you wait.  Some of them are quite rude and angry. Despite of the cons, I'd like to go back there again sometime during the week, but not weekend! One thing - kitchen floor is very slippery.  Make sure to wear shoes with antislip sole.

My friend was visiting from Union City and chose Brenda's for our Sunday brunch.  I was reluctant to come here because of the LONG wait. We got there at 9:50am and there were already 12 people on the list ahead of us. But the good thing about a long wait is that people will give up! So just hang in there...there is a very good chance about 1/3 of the people on that list won't stick it through. I tried to give my friend a tour...but there really isn't much to see in the Tenderloin! If anything, I was just trying to make sure she wasn't too cold and wouldn't get scared away by the various characters of the TL. But it turns out that it's not too scary in the morning. Once we got inside, we couldn't help but look outside and feel fortunate that we were finally in! We started off with the Beignet, which is what Brenda's is known for. If I had to describe it, I'd say it was like a funnel cake wrapped up into a bun. We chose to go with the Granny Apple Biegnet, which tasted like a McDonalds Apple Pie but a million times better! If you can't decide, you should order the Beignet Flight, which is a sampler and goes for just $8. I ordered the French Toast smothered with Butter Pecan sauce...which was a little bit overwhelming but very tasty. I thought it would be too sweet, but it was bearable. My friend ordered the Creole Omelette, which was very tasty as well. The service was pretty nice and friendly. The joint is tiny, hence the long wait. Dress warm because waiting outside for at least an hour in SF is not pleasant.

Brenda why did you keep me waiting for so long? The lines were crazy on Sunday and it was 1 in the afternoon! We waited for at least 45 to an hour. It's located next to Little Siagon which I had no idea so I got a chance to walk around. Anyways, after waiting forever and starving we finally got seats at the counter. I didn't really like the watermelon ice tea. It was something new, but not for me. I got the "Undecided" beignets 4 for $8 so basically $2 each. I wanted to try it all since it's my first time. I like that extra cajun spice on the crawfish. The chocolate one was good, but I would rather eat that for dessert instead. I wasn't satisfied with the service because one of the waitress gave our food to someone else when I complained because we waited for a long time and tables late got food before us... then she realize that she gave it to the wrong table instead -_- and was giving me attitude when I confronted her just to tell her to "check on the appetizer"  I mean it did take like 20 minutes just to get our benedicts when im sure they were already premade, but at the same time I understand they were busy. Anyways, our main waitress was nice and boxed our 2 left over and I still haven't ate it yet. I got the catfish bedgets  which was pretty good and one of them filled me up along with the grits. I liked the grits since it had more flavor than the one I had at Roscoe with all that cheese and butter. The bf got the Shrimp po boy. It wasn't the special that day, but she said she'll make it for us and it was good! I love that crunch on the shrimp on the Sarah lee's bread and we got a choice of fries or cole slaw and we got fries which wasn't that great. That they should work on, but overall I'm not sure if that wait wasn't really worth it for us. I mean it was definitely something new, but we don't have the patience to wait that long. :P I think I just wanted to try it because it was so popular. Maybe one day I'll come back. 3 stars for the long wait. It was too hot inside ( no air circulation) & I just didn't feel comfortable sitting at the counter. 4 stars for food!

They're in the process of a renovation, so there was a couple of things I could have done without this visit: the super long wait (although this is business as usual), random customers blocking that new chalkboard sign up deelie (these two dudes were standing literally in front of it doing nothing until I whipped my bag back and forth for a sec), the fact that it seemed smaller than what it used to be, the cramped feeling, the noise, the guy who decided that his seat needed to be right in the middle of the aisle was a good idea, the randomness of the service... sigh. So based on that, I'd give the experience somewhat of a "boo-ribe" rating. Anyway, I only come for the food, which is a rule I stick to everywhere, and I loved what I got this time. I wanted to eat on a budget and also have something quite tasty, and I was successful. I got an omelet this time, specifically the shrimp and goat cheese omelet with carmelized onions that comes with a biscuit and a choice of hash or grits (I got the potatoes). Oh, and some tomato bacon relish. Can I say that this choice was a total win for me? The omelet was a good size, filled with some really savory shrimp and cheesy goodness. Oh, and those carmelized onions were a good addition too. That tomato bacon relish? Wonderful. So wonderful that if I had the chance, I would bathe in it... albeit some sick, twisted chance. The biscuit I do like, but sometimes I have this weird phobia with biscuits with super crunchy crusts. So I was only happy to eat the inner soft goodness. Other than that, my friends an I shared the crawfish beignets, which were still as delicious as I remember them. I have to keep remembering that I get full easily at this place, so next time I will stick to my guns and just order some beignets or none at all. But I really can't help myself.

Luckily, I work in the Federal Building so I don't have to wait long to get in. Although, if you don't get to Brenda's by 11:30 you have to wait. I've eaten there twice.  I wasn't impressed the first time but the second time I had the yummiest pancakes ever. Definitely worth a try.  They  have beignets that are pretty good too!  Not as good as the homemade ones I remember having as a kid but quite comparable.

Those beignets are sooooo good - the crawfish ones. I wanted to try to ones with chocolate inside - but that would be just too much food since I already ordered this egg white omelet with shrimp, goat cheese and caramelized onions. Everything was to die for - the portions are big - and I enjoyed every bite. These beignets are not fried - so I didnt feel that guilty in the end. ;) The coffee was so different - it has a kick - I don't know what coffee was that - but it's so smooth and strong at the same time. I'm so glad I found this place here on Yelp and tried it out. Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!

I've been to this self-proclaimed soul food brunch spot a few times over the past couple of years, braving that horrendous line just to get a taste of a hearty, home-cooked meal.  It's a crack-in-the-wall and seating is scarce, but I like to come here every once in a while to get my fix for beignets, a corn maque choux omelette, and perhaps one of the best, flakiest buttermilk biscuits this side of the Mississippi.  They also serve a delicious oyster-fry scramble, but it's delicious only if you love oysters as much as I do.  My bf, who is not such a fan, thought it was not appetizing.  My point is that they have something for everyone here on the menu.   Minus two stars for the wait, the service, and for the fact that the food is never as hot as it could be.  Maybe it's because the servers, who seem less-than-enthusiastic to be taking your order, are really busy doing...something (which is questionable since I swear that it seems this place only fits 15 people max.).  Rest assured, you'll be full after a meal here because their dishes are of epic proprtions.

The food here was mediocre. I wasn't sure what all the bragging was all about. So the wait on Sunday morning was about an hour, but I guess that was because we were a large party (6 people). The interior of the restaurant was pretty small. The maximum occupancy for the restaurant was 40 people. So we were seated, but felt squished. I ordered the gumbo, boyfriend ordered the  Andouille and Cheddar Omelette, and someone else in the party ordered the Flight Beignet (has all 4 beignets if you can't decide on which one to order). The gumbo was okay. I couldn't taste the okra and that is my favorite ingredient in a gumbo. The omlette was nothing extraordinary, but I must admit the homemade biscuit was quite delicious. Lastly, I would say my favorite beignet would be the plain. The apple beignet tasted like an apple pie; the chocolate one was too sweet, so I would order that as a dessert. And the crawfish was too salty. The taste was different but it did not satisfy my taste bud.

One word: Overrated!  I definitely don't think it was worth the one hour wait to eat food that tastes so much like McDonald's.  We came here for Sunday lunch at 12pm, went to Philz to get coffee, then Saigon Sandwich for a chicken sandwich to hold us over, finally got a table for 3 after shivering outside for over an hour. Food was slightly above average. -Beignet Flight (crawfish, chocolate, apple, plain). I've definitely had better beignets - outside was not crispy enough, dough was more like the texture of bread. Crawfish was my favorite because it was the most flavorful. Chocolate was too rich for my taste. Apple reminded me of McDonald's fried apple pie. Plain was just plain. -Fried Catfish Po' Boy w/ French Fries. Seriously tasted like McDonald's Filet o Fish. The french fries were super crispy. -Eggs & Bacon Tartine w/ Hash. Eggs, bacon, creole tomato sauce on top of bread. The sauce was the best part, but didn't redeem the dish. Hash was watery. Service was fast and friendly. Hostess was icy, but understandably stressed given the growing wait. Atmosphere is small and cozy. Restaurant seats less than 30 people. I will only come back again if there is no wait.

Usually I'd like to say the longer you wait, the better the food taste.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great here...but not to the point where I felt the 1+ hour wait was of equal value to the lukewarm party in my mouth. I did get to see all the 'tender' in the tenderloin while I waited.  Philz coffee, Saigon Sandwich, the local KFC that had the unflappable smell of urine.  (If you scroll down to Connie C's review it's because we went together - i swear i'm not plagiarizing). Beignet Flight (crawfish, chocolate, apple, plain) -  All pretty good, the crawfish was tangy.  I really liked the apple, but only because it brought back childhood memories of mcdonalds fried apple pie (we want it fried! not baked).  But I am a sucker for sweets and particularly donuts. -Fried Catfish Po' Boy w/ French Fries.  Yes..Mcdonalds filet o fish.  I've been to Mississippi so I think I have a somewhat good taste for southern food.  I know, this isn't meant to be a purely southern joint..but I'll take the dirty south's catfish over this one.  The fries tasted like Mcdonalds fries..just not as salty. -Eggs & Bacon Tartine w/ Hash.  If my roommate said my eggs were better than the eggs here...something is terribly awesome that I'm doing in the kitchen!!!  Whether he was pulling my chain or not, I thought the creole tomato sauce was the best thing on this plate. Ambiance?  Very homey..very small.  I think part of the 1 hr wait can be attributed to the size of this place.   Walking through the kitchen to get to the restroom was sorta cool.  Made me feel like I cooked some of the food.  Oh, and I HATE restrooms where to open and close the door you need to physically touch the toilet.  As in the restroom is too small and the door swings into the restroom and takes up all the space.  You feel me?  Go there..you'll understand.  -__-

No wonder the lines are so long! Their food is simply delicious!! Portions are huge and the restaurant is tiny.  All 6 of us girls squeezed into a small square table.  I was amazed it held all our food and drinks. Watermelon iced tea was a bit overrated.  It was just ok.  Not as awesome as the reviews said it was. or maybe it was just hyped up for me and didnt live up to its exepctations, but hell you're here, might as well try it. We tried pancakes, their catfish sandwich, and also the bacon, eggs and something.  They were all yums! The lines are at least over an hour wait.  So just eat a bit before you get here or come when they open.

The beignets are very good but very filling! We got the sampler platter of beignets and it was delicious. Coming in, I thought that I would like the crawfish beignet the most, but I actually liked the plain one!! The plain beignet tasted similar to a churro and I added some of the cinnamon apple sauce/jam that was sitting on the table to it. DELICIOUS!

1.  I was extremely hung over. 2.  I decided to try Brenda's for the first time. Ordered the grillades and grits, chocolate beignets, and sweet watermelon tea.  Being the little piggy that I am, I ate all of it. 3.. Decided to take a 9:30 AM cardio dance class at my gym.  God help me! I think the only reason why I didn't blow chunks during that damn cardio dance class was because I am greedy and wanted to keep all that delicious food in my tum-tum.

I know it's a rough neighborhood but I wish I didn't witness someone steal two quarts of ice cream then try to sell it to random people waiting outside of Brenda's.  Funny enough, my company didn't understand what was going on haha.   The beignets are fine but I think half a beignet is more than enough for any one person.  Next time, I would probably share one beignet and order a cup of gumbo.  That's a fine morning.   Watermelon iced tea is wayyy too sweet but I'm just use to unsweetened tea. Um, the ice is filtered and clear.  Aces!

I went to Brenda's over the weekend on Sunday. As I was looking for parking, I noticed there was a wait since there were people outside waiting. Ask the gentleman what was the wait...45 mins. Left my name on the chalkboard and left. Walked couple blocks up Polk Street to grab some coffee. By the time we came back, we waited for like 15 mins. The wait didn't seem to long. The food here is great! I recommend the Cajun Crawfish beignet. Freaking delicious! IMO... Brenda's is way better than Mama's

I should be dead right now.  Maybe I'm writing this review from heaven.  I'm not one for waiting in line for over an hour, so we headed to Brendas on a rainy Monday morning.  Line wasn't so long, we only waited for about 20 min.  Perfect. We immediately ordered the crawfish beignets.  I could have eaten 20 of these.  They were delicious, I've never tasted anything like it. I wanted to rub it on my face. Next I had the shrimp and cheesy grits with a biscuit on the side, just to drive home the health.  It was so big that I barely ate half, as much as I wanted to finish it off right then and there.  It did make for some tasty left overs the next day. The biscuit was so flaky and buttery, might actually be better than elite cafes! This will probably be the only time I ever go here, its amazing but I can't handle 3 hour waits.  But it is a must try if you have the time and the stomach.

Don't be daunted by the wait for brunch!  It's worth it!   It was delicious and worth an hour and a half wait.  We got coffee from Peet's near by to curb hunger pangs.  And really anywhere worth eating Sunday brunch is going to have a long wait in San Francisco. We had the beignet  flight which was delicious and we couldn't decide which flavor we liked more.  I've been to New Orleans and have to say that the original beignets were pretty darn close to Cafe du Monde.  I also had a cajun bloody mary which was spicy and thick (the way I like bloody marys).  It had a pickled piece of okra in it which was crisp and delighfully tart.  If I had one quibble it would have been that I would have liked more pickled veggies in it, but that's really minor.  The biscuits are HUGE (think twice the size of a normal biscuit) and fluffy and lovely.  I had their special which was pork belly, creole sauce and egg in cheddar grits.  So rich, spicy and just the right amount of salty and just what one wants when eating brunch at a Creole/Cajun/French/Soul Food place.  The grits, and I'm a southern girl, were damn good.  Oh and it was a perfect poached egg on my plate (I've noticed that with high turn over at even the best brunch places, poached eggs can sometimes become more like hard boiled eggs, which are not yum when one wants a poached egg).  A perfect poached egg under high stress shows some great talent in the kitchen.  My friends from out of town were very impressed.  Also, it didn't break the bank.  The special was $12 the flight was $9 and the drink was $7.

Best biscuits I have ever eaten - fried chicken was ok.  Hard crust but tasty and moist.  Hash was good.  The oyster omelet was not our cup of tea but we don't like fried oyster and there was alot in the omelet.  I really enjoyed the meal, the service and the atmosphere.  Did not try the Beignets because we were too full.  Not a fan of the chicory coffee.  No wait on a Tuesday morning.

I may have just had the longest wait at a restaurant, ever. But truthfully, it was worth it. First time having brunch here (dinner wait wasn't so bad). Definitely get here early for brunch. If you get there after 1pm, you are looking at least over an hour wait. It is well worth it if you are with entertaining company. If you are hungry, order a sampling of beignets to temporarily satisfy your tastebuds! (crawfish, granny smith apple and chocolate) After over an hour of waiting, we sat waiting inside and ordered all of us a bloody mary and rested our legs. Brunch menu... so many choice. Hands down the best shirmp and grits I've ever had. The lady (fairly new enjoying oysters) ordered the Hangtown Fry, and loved it! Gumbo was also at the table, and I really enjoyed a sampling! All in all, go for it! One less star because of the wait. Get to the restaurant early and you'll definitely enjoy their food and service!

Heard great things about this place and I thought I would give it a shot and it really deserves all its accolades. The menu features down home comfort food favorites but with their own twist. I ordered  Mac and Cheese, BFC ( fried chicken)  and the Po' boy and while these are all things a lot of other restaurants offer, the way they prepare them is so different, that it really felt like I was trying something completely new. The flavors are pretty ridiculous and you'll find yourself thinking about it well after the meal.

My biggest complaint in the past has always been the long wait for a table. I absolutely love the new addition that has probably more than doubled the amount of seating. My staple favorites are the catfish po'boy and the gumbo but I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu. The catfish is perfectly fried and flaky. It is served with a special sauce on a french roll. Brenda's stays true to the soul food roots with well seasoned dishes. Other Brenda's favorites are the beignets and watermelon iced tea.

Lunched with one of my colleagues and I have to say this place was amazing, there is a decent wait when going at lunch time.  But what good place in the city doesn't have a wait.   I tried the BFC (Fried chicken) and my colleague had the French Toast... I will have to agree with others in saying EVERYTHING we had was amazing down to the homemade biscuit & homemade jam.  The fried chicken was a tad greasy... but c'mon it's FRIED chicken.  Great place to venture out to if you are in the Tenderloin but it is a trek from the Financial District.

Biegnet - done that! I went soon after they opened and it was well worth the wait - and, given the wait , that's saying something. Was there recently with a friend and.. mnnneah!  My Croq Monseur was ok the service was ok - overall - only ok.  My friend liked it all - but he was a Brenda-Virgin, (i.e. too prone to premature adjudication!) I still like the crawfish biegnet but overall - that alone is not worth the wait.   Sorry Brenda - you cant run a Soul Kitchen on a sole item....

Now that I have had the chance to eat at Brenda's several more times, I wanted to update.  I still believe it is worth 5 stars but I'm taking back my rave of the biscuits.  They still taste good but the past two times I've been there, they've been too brown and not light and fluffy.  Disappointing. Making up for the drop in biscuit quality are the sweet potato pancakes with bourbon pecan butter.  OH MY GOD!!  They are incredible!!!  I think it was the best pancake I've ever had - though it was more of dessert than breakfast.  Get an order for the table to share - you won't be disappointed.

YUMMY! My sister took me out to lunch here on a Friday afternoon and we were able to get in, in about 30mins or so. I've attempted to eat here 3 times prior on Sat or Sun's and have not been willing to wait the 1+hr to get in. It was so worth the 4th try though. We had the watermelon sweet tea - 10! Then the beignet (fried doughnut) trio (choc, strawberry, crawfish) - 7! This was way too much dough for us so we just ate the crawfish one. I'd recommend just ordering one instead of 3 for two people. We both had a cup of gumbo and shared a shrimp po boy sandwich. The gumbo - 10 was sooo delicious!! The sandwich - 7 was very good too! While there we overheard them talking about expanding into the space next door in May! Maybe then I can become a regular. This place is wonderful if you feel like some yummy southern home cooking or a really hearty breakfast. The wait is hectic though so either arrive earlier or go on weekdays.

So where do I begin?   Typical SF street parking--no parking lot but maybe you can try a garage nearby if you can't find any on the street.  We got lucky and found a spot right up front!  My party of 3 arrived at 10am thinking we'd have a chance at beating the crowd, but we ended up waiting for about 40 minutes, which is what I already expected after reading the reviews.  Anyways, like everyone said, the place is tiny.  This is not a place you want to go to with a big group. Our waitresses seated us and were prompt and polite, though I could see that they were trying to get people in and out of there as fast as they can - totally understandable.   We ordered the Crawfish Beignets and loved it!  It was a bit dough-y for me (if that makes sense) but once I made it to the middle, it was heaven!  It was full of flavor and spices and was surprisingly filling!  Who knew crawfish could ever taste this good?! Next up, I ordered the Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict with Grits.  The rest of my party ordered the Molasses Pork Chop and the Fried Catfish Po'boy.   It was hard finishing my meal because the portions are pretty big, for my small-ish stomach, and I couldn't even get to finish the creamy grits!  They have got to be the best grits I've ever had.  The catfish was fried and seasoned to perfection, not too big and not too small, topped with creole hollandaise.  I was so full I had a hard time standing up straight after my meal.  Walking straight is a overrated anyways. It was well worth it and I'm definitely coming back in the future.   -1 star for the long wait and tiny space.

I really liked this place--wish we had one in San Diego. My husband and I went to San Francisco for a vacation in May, and we were determined to hit up every popular food joint and hole in the wall place in the area. Brenda's came high recommended by fellow Yelpers, so of course I just had to check the place out. We went on on a Tuesday, mid morning, and there was already a line waiting, people were huddled out in the rain. Parking is sparse, and there's not much to look at or do while you're waiting for the table. We were outside for about 45 minutes before finally getting inside. If you have a large party, don't even bother coming here, it won't be a pleasant experience. The inside of the restaurant is VERY small and the tables are extremely close together, we were literally touch elbows with the people next to us. It also got a little hot and stuffy in there, because the dining area is so close to the kitchen. Was the food worth the wait and the general uncomfortable dining experience? Absolutely! The grits alone are worth the price of admission, and I will forever kick myself for not ordering the shrimp and grits like the lady next to me did. I got the glazed ham, eggs, grits, and biscuit plate. They were all superb, the peach jam for the biscuit was perfect--not too sweet or runny, it tasted like peach cobbler! The grits were silky smooth and buttery, and unlike any grits dish I've ever tasted in my life. The biscuits were good, but not the best I've had. The coffee was OUTSTANDING, OMG! CRACK. I was cracked out after I drank it and was jonesing for more. My husband was satisfied with his order-- The beignets stuffed with apples (he gave it a thumbs up, I was unimpressed because I was all over the peach cobblery jam), bacon, toast and potatoes. Great food, okay dining. Will definitely visit again when we're back in San Francisco, but won't bother if we can't get there by at least 8:00 am.

Definitely worth the wait! I've been here a few times and in good company an hour and a half wait seems to go by fast! The Beignet sampler is a must! Although their breakfast platters with a side of grits plus creamy biscuits? How could you go wrong? Thirsty at all? Try their Watermelon Sweet Tea... By far from start to finish one of the best in town that I can recommend)

On a rainy Wednesday - No Line!!! Had to try the famous flight of beignet. Not as great as I expected, but I am not a big beignet fan to begin with. Out of the 4 - chocolate was my favorite. Washed it down with the watermelon ice tea - decent. And served me up some Grillades and Grits - Beef cutlets braised in spicy Creole gravy served over grits, with two eggs and of course a biscuit - absolute heaven!!! Definitely coming back to try some more as long as there isn't a massive line.

I finally got to try this place after hearing about it over a year ago. I went with my roommate and a friend on MLK day, put our name down for a party of 3 at 11am, and waited 1hr and 20min! We went to Philz coffee on Van Ness and Eddy to kill some time while we waited for our table to be ready. We shared: *crawfish beignets (3/order) *shrimp and grits with bacon and cheddar (special menu) *egg and bacon tartine on sourdough with tomato relish *hangtown fry - fried oyster and bacon omelet (special menu) Every single dish was delicious! What can go wrong with anything fried, covered in melted cheese or sprinkled with bacon? Each dish is composed of a variety of intensely flavored ingredients that were so harmonious when combined. If I had to choose though, I'd say the shrimp and grits was my favorite. I don't think I can go here too often though b/c a) the wait and b) my arteries! Sinfully delicious, but should be experienced only in moderation.

Went to Brenda's French Soul Food with my daughter Saturday morning. Knowing it's a popular brunch spot, I expected to wait. We found a meter parking spot 3 blocks away. There was about 20 people waiting outside. Many of them had coffee in their friends. My daughter said lets go get some coffee at Philz which is only a block away on Van Ness. So we did. Finally I noticed that the names ahead of me were getting crossed out, I went in to expect to be called soon while my daughter went to feed the meter. The manager asked me if my party was all there, I said, yes, only my daughter went to feed the meter cuz we had been there for an hour. He said, ok, just go ahead and finish your coffee and I'll seat you when your party is here. Next thing I knew, he went ahead and seat the next party of 2. I was pissed! Soon my daughter came back and we were getting seated before I could bitch about it... But then we were asked to leave our coffee behind. Ugh! The Philz coffee was really good... :( that totally wasn't cool! Ok, about the food... Everything seemed to sound really good on the daily special board. So by default, we HAD to have the beignet. I ordered one of the special that day, cream cheese French toast with blueberry compote and my daughter got another daily special crispy pork belly with cheesy grits and poached egg, plus a biscuit. The beignet was good, but not as good as I expected. My cream cheese French toast reminded me of Denny's stuffed French toast, which was totally Not what I expected. And there wasn't enough blueberry compote for the heavy overflowing cream cheese filling and bland French toast. My daughter saisobers was good but she wasn't feeling too well so she wasn't in the best eating mood. We ended packing up most of our food. This wasn't a very good experience. I was willing to put up with the wait and the slightly annoying attitude issue if the food was great. Unfortunately the food wasn't good enough for me to forgive. On top of it all, the food didn't stay in my system long... As soon as I return home, I started to run to the toilet... Several times for the next few hours... No more Brenda's for me. I'd rather go to Dottie's, where I experienced foodgasm...

So I waited two hours, from noon to 2pm... The food was great, but to me it's worth one hour. I had the Shrimp Po'Boy, it was SO good. There's plenty of plump and fresh shrimp dressed in delicious spicy and savory sauce. The bread is toasted and crunchy, but still friendly to the bite.  It came with french fries. Chocolate beignets are filled with rich chocolate and generously dusted with heavenly powdered sugar. They were soft and warm... it's truly mouth-watering. The downside is waiting outside where there are plenty of homeless people to ask you for change, but if you chat it up with friends, it's good time to catch up. The great: amazing food and friendly service. The not so great: the wait, waiting area.

I went back yesterday, during the most crowded time. And again, the staff was incredibly friendly. Skeptical as I was, I tried the crawfish beignet. Who. Knew. Pretty damn good. I also ordered the fried oyster/bacon scramble with grits and biscuit. The biscuit melted in my mouth, and the grits? best I ever had. I'm going back this morning!!!

I absolutely love this place!  I've said it once and I'll say it again...it's all about expectations: 1) Expect to wait 45 minutes (read: you might want to hang out at a friend's place, run an errand, or take a nap on the street corner after putting your name down) 2) Expect a tiny SF style restaurant where you barely have enough room to breathe (read: leave the giant coat, shopping bags, and big hair at home) 3) Expect to be served some of the best, most authentic, full-flavored cuisine you've had in years!! (read: dieters, STAY OUT! Your complaints about the hollandaise and beignets are a total buzz kill). 4) Expect to get a great value 5) Expect to leave half-concerned that you might keel over from a heart attack. (read: DAMN THAT WAS SOME GOOD BREAKFAST!) My recommendations are the chickory coffee (I actually didn't like the Watermelon tea too much - too "Watered down", no pun intended), the omelettes, cajun eggs benedict, and all of the beignets.  However, I could easily make an entire breakfast out of just 3 crawfish beignets...so savory, so rich, a bit on the salty side, but I can forgive Brenda because she tops it off with chili powder which is just oh so perfect! P.S. Not to be a penny pincher but just think of the great value here - 4 beignets for $8...that's $2 each!  And Peet's & Starbucks over here are trying to pass off a teeny slice of banana bread for more than that!  Hmpfh!

Since I was not quite productive "working" from home on Friday, I decided to drive to SF to grab lunch at Brenda's, which has been on my long list of "to try" restaurants. We ordered chicken and andouille sausage gumbo, shrimp po-boy, and a "flight" of beignets, which were enough to feed 2 people. I'd give 3.5 starts for food and 4 stars for service. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, just as long as you are not expecting to get very authentic food from Louisiana. The name of the restaurant is Brenda's French Soul Food, not Brenda's Cajun Restaurant, so I should not be too harsh. Shrimp in the po-boy was cooked well, but the bread is sweeter and spongier, not quite the type of bread you would expect for the real po-boy. The texture of beignets were off, although the piping hot chocolate and the apple ones were tasty (as long as you are not expecting to get the real beignets). The gumbo was okay.  There are more reviews on breakfast items, so perhaps that's what I should try next time.

I came here last night w/ a friend around 930pm for a late dinner. No wait what-so-ever, which was awesome! They close at 10pm but we didn't feel rushed at all. The restaurant is small and cute! Service was great! Now lets move on to the food..it was delicious! The menu was simple and we got  the dishes our server recommended- Shrimp & Grits, BFC (it came w/ mac and cheese and a huge biscuit), crawfish beignets, gumbo and we finished our dinner with ghirardelli chocolate beignets!!! Everything was amazing, my favorite was the BFC (fried chicken), so much flavor. Brenda's has become one of my favorite restaurants! Awesome food and service!

I'm from the South and I can say their crawfish beignets and cheesy grits might just be better than some i've had in the South. My boyfriend and I come here almost every other weekend. It's nestled on Polk Street kind of in the tenderloin but I don't care!! this place is delicious!!! I went on a Saturday morning on a holiday weekend (not a great idea) and waited 2 hours.  But well worth the wait. Their watermelon ice team is to die for too... This place is a must!

This place is crazy good!  The beignets are amazingly good.  The wait outside gets radical because people are dying to eat here.  Somehow, when my friend and I went, we snuck right in and sat at the counter with no wait! Ha!  Im positive that someone wanted to murder us for this. Thats ok, their grits make it worth it!  Also their selection of eggs benedict, and fried oyster scrambles, agggghhhh i cant take it.  I need to go back here.

I'm glad I tried this place, but I'm not sure I will be able to brave the neighborhood again. The wait to get in is very long, and prospective patrons are forced to stand outside and suffer the cracked-out panhandlers. Today's featured beggar was a woman who claimed to have just been discharged from the hospital -- where she contracted MRSA! -- and needed bus fare to get to another hospital to have her MRSA treated. Assuming I do not contract MRSA after this encounter, I will consider this restaurant adventure a success. If I do get MRSA, well, I may have to revise this review. The food here is very good. The beignets were terrific and the biscuits even better.  The etouffet was tasty and the vegetable omelette had a good flavor but was a little too watery. The location is a really big strike against this place. Honestly, I'm totally over going to ghettos for good food. Tasty meals can be found in safe places, too.

Tasty food. A+ Eggs were done perfectly. Grits didn't have enough texture. Beignets were great last time, but a little dry this time. It's a unique experience. Plenty of street parking outside. But be prepared to wait outside for a table.   Very small place. I was very comfortable sitting at the bar area. Felt like I was sitting on top of the table right behind me. Nice use of the mirror to give the illusion of more space. Service was excellent. Clientle was friendly.

Come early for dinner around 5:30pm and have your choice of seating in this cozy gem! The shrimp and cheese grits was a smooth mouth watering pleasure. Loved the balance of spices in the tomato-bacon gravy. I also thought the crawfish beignets were delicious, but my boyfriend thought they were a little salty. We agreed that the selection of Italian wine whether black or white complements the food really well.

WE CLOSE WHENEVER WE WANT - should be posted below their sign! I'd driven by Brenda's more than once and saw a crowd of people. I decided to come later in the afternoon to try for a smaller crowd, so myself and two others showed up at 2:30 (a half an hour before they close) and the clipboard had CLOSED at the bottom. Beyond frustrated after having driven twenty minutes (picked up a friend whom I talked up the possibility of Brenda's to) plus five looking for parking I went inside and asked If I could take over one of the names on the list if they didn't show up. Libby the manager didn't care that it was a half hour till closing or that I had made a grand effort to get there and very rudely stated I was out of luck (in so many words).   Thanks for the wonderful.. Oh wait you were closed

Yum. So good. And I'm limited, being a vegan. But I got the Vegan Sloppy Josephine and it was so freaking delicious (I was so glad I had ignored another reviewer who called it flavorless). It was anything but. I wish I could recreate that flavor. I added caramelized onions and avocado, which made it even more fantastic, but it would be perfect without. As the fries are not vegan, are super sweet waitress offered me a salad. It was fresh and delicious. My mom was there with me; she is not vegan and had the Croque Monsieiur. She said "oh my god" at least 5 times--in a good way. She also got the beignet flight, so she could sample all flavors. She liked all, and said the crawfish one was "spicy but not fishy". We had the watermelon iced tea, which was refreshing and not too sweet like we feared it might be. And the community coffee. So strong and flavorful, just like we like it. Based on other reviews, we were fortunate to go mid-week, mid-day and didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. But it is well worth the wait. I would go knowing that I had only one option. I am so happy to read that Brenda's is expanding; I hope they expand their vegan options since they are super talented at making tofu very flavorful based on the sandwich I had (hint-hint).

You know that warm cozy feeling you get in your stomach when drinking hot chocolate on a cold day? That's Brenda's. A small hole-in-the-wall (literally - there's not even a sign on the front of the bulding) with about 6 tables and bar stools. Even though it's tiny, that's what adds to the atmosphere. You feel as if you are in on a little secret as you sit inside and watch the people walk by wondering why people are waiting outside this little place. There is no waiting inside. Once you come upon the black and red building next to a Taco Bell, the sign tells you to put your name on the list hanging. When my friend and I arrived around 10:30a on a Friday, there were only a few parties of two ahead of us. We only waited about 15 minutes. We started with the Beignet Flight which was really yummy. Yelpers did not lie - the crawfish one was really good. I couldn't pick a favorite, the apple was probably my least favorite but it's like trying to pick your least favorite dessert. I ordered the Peach Cobbler Pancakes on special and a watermelon iced tea. My friend ordered the Creole Veggie Omelette with grits. The iced tea was very good, but I do agree that it would have been awesome if ice cold. However, my pancakes were AMAZING!! The best pancakes I have ever had! Chunks of peaches in a thick fluffy pancake with a sweet streusel topping. Sooo good! My friend loved her omelette but was surprised to see her grits. After living in New Orleans for a while, she said she had never seen them yellow from the butter. But she said they were very good. I did not care for them.  can't wait to go back and try something else! Total bill for two: $34

Two stars? The good to decent: ambiance & service The not so good: food Ordered: Fried Green Tomatoes - decent breading, piping hot but tasted stale - as if they were re-fried from an earlier order that didn't go out.  Chipotle sauce (?) on the side was very mayonnaise-y and didn't compliment the spices of the breading. Oyster Po' Boy - oysters were cooked perfectly with an amazing breading and then the kitchen dumped on top about 3 OZ of Chipotle sauce.  Closing the sandwich caused all the oysters and all the chipotle sauce to fall out.   WTF is up with Brenda's French Soul Food making their food a vehicle for the Chipotle Sauce? When the waitress checked-in I told her my thoughts regarding the sandwich and informed her that, for me, the meal was over.  She promptly brought the check with charges for the tomatoes and my drink.

I have to give this place two stars because what ruins this place is the food, the price, and the extremely long wait. You would think that after waiting too long, anything would taste good, but I disagree. I got some $9 special for the day; some waffle with fruit syrup. It was extremely sweet. If I wanted something that sweet, I would have gone to 7-eleven to buy some candy and bread. It would have been cheaper, and I would not be hungry still. I ate some of my fiancee's beignets, which helped fill the void in my stomach. However, I still don't understand the wait for these beignets. I mean, I didn't even have to wait so long at Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery for goodies. Maybe there aren't any good soul food places in San Francisco? At least nothing is coming to my mind as I'm writing this now.

My friend and I got a flight of beignets, the crawfish beignet was to die for.  We also shared the Grillades & Grits: beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy, served with grits & two eggs any style, plus cream biscuit...amazing!  The Creole Bloody Mary was one of the best bloodies I've had as well.  Can't say enough about the food here.   Waited about an hour on a friday late morning, but well worth the wait.  And I would wait again (and will the next time I'm in town)!  Service a bit rushed, but friendly.   Overall, great experience, and I would say one of the best brunches I've had.

Eating at Brenda's is one of those "Is this real life?" moments.  The hushpuppies are what I imagine it would taste like if Jesus deep fried the Holy Spirit, while the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) is crispy enough to make you renounce everything.  Come hungry though; their chocolate oozing beignets are not for greenhorns.

Just another sign of gentrification in the good ol' Loin, but hey i'm planning on a positive review here so, i guess the white table cloths and hipsters downing meaty omelets don't out do the fair prices!! Ahh my wifey and i were pleasantly surprised after finishing our meal here on Polk and Eddy - heartwarming breakfasts for a hung over body really did the trick. I was daring and had the oyster and bacon omelet...for someone who really enjoys oysters at all times of the day, i highly recommend it, but i wouldn't order it again under those conditions :). This flavor-oozing, intense omelet was followed by a delightfully guilt-free ghiradelli filled beignet :) be prepared to share, one order comes with three of those fried puppies haha anyhow, all in all, i highly recommend hitting this place up for a breakfast or lunch. cool, simple vibe, fair prices and great food. xx

This place is so popular that there are always crowds of hipsters swarming around the front. The first time I tried to eat here I was told that there would be an hour and a half wait for 2 people. We decided to go somewhere else. We came back on Easter. The wait would be 2 hours long. We decided to order to go. Please just order to-go next time if you want to avoid the crowds of hipsters. We were happily munching on beignets in under 15 minutes. The food was pretty good, my only complaint is that the beignets were a bit on the doughy side. If it had more delicious filling, this place would be 5 stars. I would even prefer if they were a bit smaller with a less carby shell. I only tried the apple beignet and the crawfish beignet, of the two I preferred the crawfish. The watermelon tea was also fantastic. It had the essence of watermelon, tasted as if you just blended up some watermelon but with the texture of tea. Pretty delicious, make sure to order one to go with your crawfish beignets.

On day 2 of my 10+ year delayed trip to San Francisco, the group and I stopped by Brenda's for breakfast before a day of sightseeing around town. FIRST IMPRESSIONS: We were met at the door with a small wait, but it was managed quickly by customers writing their own names and party sizes on a chalkboard inside and staff crossing it off as groups are seated. The tables are a little tight in some of the corners, but the atmosphere is friendly, quaint, and homey while still feeling fresh and swanky. THE EATS: I started by ordering their Granny Smith Apple beignets. The plate arrives with three steaming puffy French pastries topped with a dusting of powdered sugar and filled with warm cinnamon sauce and granny smith apples. These were amazingly tasty and disappeared quickly among my table of four. (As they should have.) For my second course I ordered their Egg & Bacon Tartine with the potato hash as my side. The dish consisted of two generous slices of bacon covered with a simple egg frittata, Gruyere cheese, and a sweet tomato-bacon relish all served over a toasted slice of French bread. The dish was so well balanced, it was savory but light, salty but sweet, and soft and crunchy all together at once. The potato hash side was equally balanced and had a nice hint of scallion that made me take that last bite to clean my plate. My friends were also generous enough to share a bite of their dishes with me as well and I can say that Brenda's Croque Monsieur, Smoked Catfish Eggs Benedict, and Crispy Pork Belly with Cheesy Grits were all equally amazing. THE VERDICT: I will definitely return here at least once on any trip to San Francisco and will recommend it gleefully to my friends and family. Bravo!

Went here with a few friends on a Saturday for "brunch". We arrived around 1p and proceeded to scribble our party's name on the chalkboard... were seated within 30 minutes, however the wait felt like it was HOURS... i think that's because of our excitement and hunger pains. Nonetheless we ordered the sampler of beingets, and if i had to rank them in order it would go like this 1. crawfish, 2. apple, 3 chocolate, 4 plain.  We also tried the chicken sausage gumbo which wasn't to my liking it was lacking flavor and seasonings. Amongst all the previous food we barely had room for more, BUT continued to EAT. I had the shrimp and grits... AMAZING and I will definitely order this AGAIN. My friends opted for the omelets with potato hash, both were disappointed with the "hash" as it was bland, and very soft (consistency of almost ready boiled potatoes for mashed potatoes) and the omelets were runny.  Being that Brenda's isn't KNOWN for their omelets... I will let that experience slide for the record.

Pull apart a nice fluffly biscuit, pile it up with some grits, meat and sunny side up egg, and dip it again in the grillades sauce for that extra goodness.  I totally overate that day, but it balanced out because I wasn't hungry for another 8 hours. Croque was pretty good, and the apple beignet was great. Grabs the extra star because we didn't have to wait and got to leapfrog some larger parties and still made it out before the meter ran out.

I really really tried to love this place because it's so charming.  While I was waiting outside for our party of four to be seated around noon, we saw a flock of suits come by and walk away disappointed because their lunch hour wasn't long enough for them to wait to be seated at Brenda's.  Later, while I was in the restaurant, we saw this family with hella suitcases leaving.  It's so cute that they either had to have Brenda's before they left, or right when they got to SF.   But the beignets were were inconsistent.  We got the flight of beignets for the table, and for the most part, it was agreed that the beignets weren't all that special.  Tasted a little like the doughnuts I used to try out canned biscuit dough, except more doughy.  The plain beignets were really good.  By itself, it had the perfect amount of sweet and, somehow, salty.  The apple beignet was more cinnamon than apple.  The Chocolate was pretty good and recommended if you're a chocolate lover.  The Crawfish beignet was interesting and I'd definitely order it again to reassess how good it is. I split a side order of Mac N Cheese with my friend.  It's very traditional Mac N Cheese, so it's perfect if you like it that way.  I thought it was too salty, but it had a nice crust of cheese on top which was lovely.   I also split the peach cobbler pancakes.  The order comes with two huge pancakes and creme fraiche.  I guess I was too full from everything else to fully enjoy these.  I took it home and had it for dessert after dinner and DAMN it was good.  Fluffy as hell and moist because there are bits of peach in it.  They're nice chunks, too, not just some wussy diced crap.  It felt like real home cooking somehow... I know I know... this place has limited seating.  But it's a little ridiculous  that a waitress can't even walk through the aisles to bring food.  Safety hazard?  I was sitting in the line of fire apparently and my arm was knocked hella times. In conclusion, I would go back to Brenda's because of THE UNLIMITED REFILLS OF THE WATERMELON SWEET TEA.  A little watermelon pulp with some sweet tea is the most refreshing thing ever.  I just found a new drink obsession.  This would be a 5 except the cinnamon.  I don't know why that's just unforgivable. Definitely the best breakfast food I've had in the city!

It's rare that we make it out of the house early enough on a weekend morning to get to the city in time for breakfast. Even though there's TONS of breakfast spots I want to try, it's just hard to motivate on a Saturday morning. However, this particular Saturday we had made plans to meet friends at Brenda's French Soul Food. Making actual plans is the only way it was going to happen. By the time we got there around 10:30 there was a crowd of people waiting, but the line went quickly and we were soon seated. The watermelon sweet tea sounded too good to pass up. It was a unique blend of watermelon juice and standard black tea. Yum! I opted for the "flight" of four beignets. If you can't decide on a flavor, why not try all four? I was in fried doughy goodness heaven! The plain beignet was the perfect softness, the chocolate filled was intense, but not too sweet, the granny smith apple with cinnamon was just the right crunch/spice ratio and the crawfish with scallions and cheddar provided the perfect savory balance. My girlfriend ordered the special bananas foster french toast and it was dessert disguised as breakfast. Talk about indulgent! All of the breakfast menu items sounded good. I hope I can motivate myself to get to the city again for weekend breakfast.

OH MY GOODNESS!! This place is FANTASTIC! Hands down one of our new favorite places to go! We found this place on Yelp (we meaning one of my best buddies and I) and we decided to take a trip out there... So, My husband and I and two of my best girls from work and their hubbies went out to SF one saturday morning and we vow to go back at least once every month! We started with the flight of beignets and OH MY...sooo yummy! Wondering with how they fair against Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans but these were darn tasty! My favorite ones were the plain ones but the apple and chocolate ones were fantastic! For Brunch I had the Croque Monsiour with fries and it was super good! My friend ordered the andouille sausage omelette with grits and I had never tried them before but they were SOOO good! The Omelette's comee with a biscuit too which are so terriffic you dont even need any butter...they practically melt in your mouth. Another favorite was the Cafe Au Lait and the Watermelon Tea both of which were absolutely fantastic! Everything about this place is superb, the food, the service... We all were in a food coma for the rest of the weekend but it was worth it!

It's pretty much all true. You'll wait.  And wait.  And wait.  (Best pick up some coffee on the way.) The place is as tiny as the food is decadent. The biscuits are huge and flaky and taste like a heart attack covered in rhubarb jam.   You will be sorry if you don't order the crawfish beignets. Likewise, if the shrimp and cheddar grits special is on the chalkboard, this is what you should be ordering.

You know the pressure - you are asked to pick a place to eat with friends. How can you judge when you rarely go out for food and tend to read more about it on yelp than anything? Oh yeah, there you go then. Yelping for Brunch brought Brenda's up close to the top of the list and yes, I am drawn to anything with 4 stars and plentiful reviews. Soul food is also intriguing - I couldn't really imagine what soul food is. So I figured this would be a good place to start - and to drag my friends. So - queue-wise - yuck yuck yuck. Why couldn't people go to the Taco Bell next door for 79cents? 79cents of I have no idea, but I guess they were as determined as us to get in. The restaurant itself is teeny-tiny - and my party of 4 were placed disconcertingly along a mirror-lined bar. I am not sure I want to watch my fat face chewing a pile of breakfast, but I managed to keep my eyes averted for the duration. Food-wise was pretty good. My friends tried the beignets (the sweet ones went down pretty well, savoury not so much). We then all had pretty much the same - veggie omelettes and shrimp & goats cheese omelettes all round. They were HUGE. Even tho I had to wait while my friends chewed through their beignets and I was STARVING, I couldn't finish the pile in front of me. The biscuit was light and fluffy (tho I am still not sure if I am wholly sold on the concept in its entirety), the omelette likewise. Bless the waiters too - they were lovely, even tho rushed off their feet. And they had the foresight not to put our order of french toast (eyes and belly, eyes and belly). A lesser waiter would have cared not. Overall, we all enjoyed our meals. Tho that queue would make me either go early or not at all. I don't do queues.

A-OK is what I am giving this place.  I really wanted to come here since I saw a long line.  I waited about 20 minutes, then my company was seated.  I had a party of 3. We started with 2 watermelon ice teas, cafe au lait & waters all around.  The tea was pleasant, but it seems like I could make it really.  The cafe au lait, good.  We also ordered the sampler of beignets.  The oh so talked about crawfish beignets, EGH...  the other beignets, EGH....   The flavor was just not there, I really wasn't feelin' the hype.  I did like the Gumbo soup though. Then came our entrees.  I ordered the Grillades and Grits, EGH, the meat was tough - the grits were not hot and had that rubbery top from sitting too long, the eggs were delicious...  another ordered the Corned Beef Hash, EGH, the eggs were delicious - too much potatoes and not a lot of beef....  lastly the oyster po boy was ordered and that was okay, the fries were good - sandwich was alright.  The biscuit was delicious! Overall I wasn't feelin' what the hype of 4-5 stars that this place received from fellow yelpers.  I liked Mama's way better even though the wait is way longer.  The service is excellent though... I'm not sure when I'd go back unless I was with a small party that wanted to try it and then I'd go for the Banana Foster's French Toast...   That was next to us and that looked delicious!

This is a new favorite!  The beignets are delicious, and I would recommend the sampler.  The crawfish beignet was surprising and my favorite!  I had the shrimp and goat cheese omelette as my main course and tried my friend's granola pancakes.  The granola added a new surprising twist to pancakes. The only downside.... the place is itsy bitsy.  For a party of three we had to wait at least an hour.  We entertained ourselves by peering in at the food at the table that faced the window and very likely freaking them out.... whoops! Blame the growling stomachs!

Yes you will probably have to wait unless you arrive early on a week day morning! But trust me Brenda's is worth the wait. The service is best described as friendly and efficient. This is not your neighborhood coffee shop where you can mingle and relax over cups and cups of coffee. You go to Brenda's for the food! While the staff is too polite to try to rush you out of their the large crowd of people waiting outside should give you the hint. I've only been for breakfast, however, I've been serveral times with serveral groups. My friends and I always share a whatever's ordered. So I've been luck to try lots of thier specials as well at the standard breakfast menu. Everything has always been good from the egg and bacon tartine to the goat cheese and shrimp omelette and the fabulous sweet potatoe pancakes. You can't go wrong for breakfast at Brenda's.

Went back this morning, determined to try the beignets. I'd give the Granny Smith a B, the chocolate filled ones a B+, and the plain one an A- But the crawfish one - holy mackrels that was good.  Spicy and savory and cheesy and creamy...yeah it was just that good. Was there at 8:30 am on Sunday morning and it was full but no line.  Go early! Brought back a shrimp po'boy for a friend, who proceeded to inhale the sandwich at 10 am. Didn't even offer me a taste - guess it's that good... EAT THE CRAWFISH BEIGNETS. You will not regret it.

Man, the bf and I were so excited to try Brenda's this trip!  We got up early so we would miss the usual Brenda's crowd.  We arrive about 845 and are seated immediately.  I order the beignets and coffee, bf gets french toast and oj.  I'm still excited at this point.   Fast forward to our food arriving...Um, I'd like to change the name of the beignets to meh-gnets.  Seriously, what was the hype all about?  Our meh-gnets were totally overcooked and actually pretty gross, even the chocolate one!  The only one that was somewhat edible was the plain one.  Bf did like the filling in the crawfish meh-gnet.   I really wanted to like Brenda's and thought ordering a side of taters would save this review.  Well, the potatoes were just ok.  Not enough to warrant another star. Sorry, B, we tried and you just didn't live up to the hype.  :(

I was not hungry when we got in line, but after the 20min wait, and lots of hype about the biscuits, I was dying to eat.   The watermelon iced tea and biscuits alone are worth the wait, but to not eat more does injustice to the huge line outside, so I had the Catfish Poboy with slaw.   Amazing that is all I can say, the slaw was light on the dressing which allowed the flavor of the carrots and cabbage to make a much needed appearance.  Probably the best slaw I have ever had.   The Poboy is topped with a Chipotle Remoulade, which is an excellent dipper if you have some fries (also delicious).

I wish I had a better experience as this was my last meal before leaving SF to go back home. We didnt wait very long as there were 2 counter seats that we took. Ordered the Beignet Flight, which came with a Plain Beignet, Chocolate Beignet, Apple Beignet, and Crawfish. As mains, I ordered the Andouille Sausage Omelette w/Hash + Biscuit and my bf got the French Toast. Now for beignets, I always thought they were supposed to be soft. At least that's what I had before in another southern restaraunt. But the ones I had here were tough, chewy, and dry. Disappointing. My main wasn't anything to write home about either as the Hash was mushy, and the biscuit crumbled to the touch. The sausage bits were good, but there weren't very many in the omelette. My bf said his French Toast was burnt, and that the brioche was stiff as well. Meh. :(

After checking out the reviews this morning and trying beignets for the first time earlier this week at Just For You (Potrero Hill) I was down to try this place.  I have to say that I was super excited as each order came out.  Here are a few positives and negatives - overall, I liked the place and see why the ratings are all mostly 4 and 5 stars. Positives: - Watermelon Tea:  This drink is SO refreshing!  There's a nice hint of watermelon and the tea is already sweetened so you don't need to add sugar.  I would recommend that you definitely try this.  I'm a fan! - Beignet Flight:  If it's your first time definitely go for this beignet sampler so you get to try all 4 different beignets they offer.  I have to say that after trying the sampler I still like the plain beignet best.  The chocolate was a bit sweet for me, the apple yum, and the crawfish was good, but didn't really go with the other 3 sweet ones.   - Ham & Cheese Omlet - This was pretty bomb.  The eggs were made perfectly and it goes well with a bowl of fruit.  I like that most places overlook putting bananas in their fruit salads but not Brenda's!  The fresh jam is also delicious Negatives: - Banana Bread Pudding French Toast:  This was one of the specials for today (5/10) and I was stoked for it.. but it turned out to be a bit too heavy.  It was straight up what the name says -- but heavier.  I'm a huge fan of french toast, but this was just too heavy especially with the pecan sauce over it.  It also came with cream.. the boy couldnt get enough of the stuff with a big lump of cream on each bite. - The wait takes FOREVER.  Yes we went right at noon which was probably the peak busy time on a Sunday, but we ended up walking down to the Asian Art museum checked out the Bhutan exhibit for about an hour, walked back, and STILL waited for about 20-30 minutes for a table for two.  When we got in, we found out why.  The place is super tiny!!

Amazing!!! I haven't had such yummy beignets since we lived near Cafe du Mond in New Orleans.  We had the beignet flight plus a really good shrimp and goat cheese omelette and eggs benedict with fried catfish... Our little one loved the sweet potato pancakes..  The biscuits were delicious! The staff was friendly, the place small and cozy, and well worth the wait!  This would definitely become one of our regular places if we lived closer. And amazing how affordable it is for such great food!

A friend told me about this place prior to me leaving for SF I was quite happy that it was literally a walking distance where I was staying. This place is super tiny and the wait can be up to 2 hours so the trick is to go shopping or walk around city hall instead of waiting in front with everyone else.. however, if you miss the call then you're assed out! Anyway, I didn't know what to expect but a friend told me to get the craw fish beignets which I did and that's when I decided that I HAVE to get that every single time I'm back in SF! it's not heavy nor spicy and the dough is fresh and literally melt in your mouth! Just thing about it as I'm writing makes my mouth water! The grits there are also delicious, but definitely crawfish beignet for me..

I've been wanting to have some good breakfast in the city and Brenda's was on the top of my list. I finally got to try it out with a group of my friends a couple of weeks ago and left with ho-hum feelings about the whole experience. We arrived at Brenda's at about 10:30 with visions of beignets and benedicts in our heads. We had drooled over the yelp pictures while at work for days and the time ways finally here to see them in the flesh! We expected a wait BUT ended up waiting +2.5 hour and the end of which we were all wondering if it was all gonna be worth it!! We concluded that the food was thoroughly enjoyable but not worth coming back considering the wait time. We ordered the beignet flight (included a plain, chocolate, granny apple, and crawfish) and each got an egg entree. I also ordered the watermelon ice tea which I was disappointed in. I loved all the beignets, they came out piping hot and cute as a button. We all dug in trying to not mix the inside fillings amongst each flavor. The chocolate one would go perfectly with a cup of coffee in the morning. The majority of my party though chose the crawfish  as their favorite - by the end of our meal one of my friends had already ordered an order to go for later. I loved my egg and bacon tartine, the egg was done just right and the relish on top added just the right amount of pizazz. I got the hash on the side which was enjoyable but after trying my friends grits I was having some serious food envy.   I would definitely also recommend the grilleles and grits which is beef and gravy over the creamiest yummiest grits you've ever had. The experience at Brenda's was fun, but the wait wasn't worth it. We noticed a lot of people stopped by for to-go orders of beignets which are cheap, $4-8 to go along with the morning coffee from Philz which is just a couple blocks away. I  may be back, but to-go for sure!

All around excellent breakfast. 1000+ reviews cannot be wrong. Food excellent. Order anything. Biscuits beautiful. Grits Stunning. Coffee strong and the waitstaff is stronger. They never rested for one second the entire time they worked. Now why only three stars? I felt rushed after I had waited and waited and waited and then they passed over our names but they were really nice about it and sat us as soon as I pointed out the error. I still felt rushed. Perhaps I should have come out much earlier like when I went to Dotty's. Everyone was so nice, but I still felt rushed.

It was the coffee that brought down the rating from 4 to 3 stars. For a breakfast place I was expecting great coffee. But for whatever reason, a simple cup of coffee tasted like sludge. Not good, especially at $2.25. Coffee (and juice - not freshly squeezed) aside, the food itself was good. We started with the flight to beignets ($9) - 4 total - one of each - regular, chocolate filled, apple-filled and spicy crawfish. They were good but dense not like the Cafe du Monde type. I had the Grillades and Grits ($10.50) - beef slices with deep brown gravy, grits (yum), 2 eggs (your choice of prep), and choice of toast or biscuit (choose biscuit - buttery soft flaky - super yum). Big portions! It's actually good for sharing especially if you start with the beignets. Just be prepared for the long wait unless you can wake up and get to Brenda's before 11a. Not much seating and definitely not good food for large groups. Good luck, it's worth trying.

3.5 stars Way overrated. Definitely not worth waiting in line for. This is one of those places in SF that does a cuisine that not many SFers are familiar with, and therefore gets away with something that wouldn't pass in that cuisine's native area. The beignets were chewy. Beignets are supposed to be crispy. I could see the butter in the grits, but I couldn't taste it. It's supposed to be the other way around. That being said, the hangtown fry, watermelon iced tea, and my friend's egg scramble were all delicious.

Brenda's sister-in-law sent me a message after my initial review letting me know that the coffee served there is chicory coffee specially shipped in from New Orleans and served at the famous Cafe Du Monde. It has an interesting history which I stole from the Cafe Du Monde website: The taste for coffee and chicory was developed by the French during their civil war. Coffee was scarce during those times, and they found that chicory added body and flavor to the brew. The Acadians from Nova Scotia brought this taste and many other french customs (heritage) to Louisiana. Chicory is the root of the endive plant. Endive is a type of lettuce. The root of the plant is roasted and ground. It is added to the coffee to soften the bitter edge of the dark roasted coffee. It adds an almost chocolate flavor to the Cafe Au Lait served at Cafe Du Monde. So, I guess chicory coffee is probably an acquired taste, but I found it bitter and not appetizing.

A tiny space that feeds the masses (what else is new in San Francisco). Brenda's is fantastic. While you wait for your turn approximately 40-60minutes, walk down to City Hall, see the new Buddha sculpture, then walk down Van Ness to Philz Coffee for a delicious cup of coffee, head back towards Brenda's and you shouldn't have to wait not to much longer (hopefully). The tiny restaurant has a few tables and a counter facing a mirror. Wish didn't have to sit infront of the mirror but it was okay. You can see Brenda cooking away in a tiny kitchen. I had the sausage omelet and the chocolate beneigh. The chocolate beneigh was very good. Didn't like the potatoes with the omelet that much. Dont forget to try the watermelon ice tea (delicious). The servers are very nice and wont rush you , even though there's atleast 20 other people waiting outside.

Sooooo good! I went with 2 friends on a Sunday and the wait was well over an hour. It was worth every minute. The food here is amazing. I tried the beignet sampler and had the poached eggs with fried catfish and holondaise sauce on the flakiest, butteriest biscuit possible. This is probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Each item was done perfectly and complimented everything else on the plate. The beignets were also amazing. My favorite ones were the crayfish and the chocolate. My friends also liked their orders although a warning to anyone who tries the goat cheese and crayfish omelet- its very goat cheesy (I'm not a fan of it, but i know a lot of people are.)

Metered parking is worse than at ucla. $3 an hour. But you can also use dollar coins. Must trys:  watermelon iced tea, Brie en croute salad We tried: baked Brie en croute salad, beignet flight, andouille sausage, vegan Josephine w fries, creole veg omelet, french toast w pecan syrup. Yes, the wait time sucked. We went on a monday morning (11am) and still waited about an hour. They did take over the space next door, so I can't wait til they expand! I went here one other time with Virginia L. but we left because of the wait on a Sat! Salad: dry salad that packs a huge punch. I could have just ate this and been in heaven. Baked Brie in crusty pastry, flavored nuts, delish spices and mustard and fried onion crisps. It was the best salad I have ever eaten! Beignet Flight: I know everyone says the crayfish one is the shiz, but everyone thought it was a bit too fishy. In fact, this was the only beignet left. The Flight is a good deal because 4 of those huge suckers for only $9?? Wow. The chocolate one was my fave, although I think beignets are supposed to be lighter, fluffier, and less doughy. The french toast w/ pecan syrup was amazing. It actually was not overly sweet like I thought it would be. It is a HUGE serving, as is all their dishes, but the pecan sauce and light fluffy brioche french toast make me feel like I am in the dirty dirty. Vegan Josephine w/ Fries- SO good. The sloppy joe part was insanely flavored, and they gave me the hugest scoop of life. Fries were pretty delish, soft even though they were thin, and really salty. Creole Veggie Omelet- Really good flavor on the vegs. Hash was pretty decent too, no the usual American hash. The omelet is really fluffy (mucho cream!) and the veggies are done perfectly. I think the food here in general is a little salty, which is fine with me because I love salt, but that is just what I found. Seriously, people, try the baked brie en croute salad!!!! I think I gained 8 pounds here. SO worth it. Yummilicious Factor = A+

Maybe 4.5 stars. I enjoyed a nice brunch here on Saturday.  We (three of us) got there around 10:00 AM. We waited about 30 minutes to get a table.  Negative - they don't offer (for purchase) or serve coffee for people waiting in line! Watermelon iced tea, coffee, beignet sampler (chocolate, apple, plain and crawfish), shrimp po boy, sweet potato pancakes, and an omelet with grits and biscuit. I liked the crawfish and apple beignet, even though it was a little dense. It was a bit heavy, but still good. I wouldn't order the sampler again. I'd definitely order the sweet potato pancakes - rich potato flavor and yummy pecan syrup. The omelet was good, but the grits and biscuit were better. Shrimp po boy was really good. The shrimp was fried well and just a good mixture of textures and flavor. Can't wait to go back!

The wait time is really long and the restaurant is super tiny. I'd recommend them moving into a larger space to accommodate the hungry crowd and so they can make more money. We waited a good 45 mins to be seated. The wait for the food was also super long. We waited for about 20-30 mins before the food arrived. I ordered the shrimp and goat cheese omelet which came with their hash and biscuit. The shrimp and goat cheese omelet sounded great on the menu and to the waitress, but it tasted almost disgusting.  The hash was good, but the best was the biscuit. Although I wasn't completely satisfied, I'd like to give this place another shot and order a different item.

Not bad for brunch food. This is exactly a french soul food place. Greasy and fried brunch food, but still good. This is a small place in the ghetto Tenderloin. Wait isn't that long usually. Around 15min-20min wait. Food: - Sweet Watermelon Tea (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - $2.25 This tea is unlimited refills. It is very good and refreshing but after the 3rd cup, it does get a little too sweet. - Beignet Flight (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - $8.00 Great to flight to try out all their flavors. Its basically a fried dough with 4 different fillings. I like the chocolate one and loved the crawfish one. The rest was just ok.  You can order individual flavors for $6 but only comes in 3. - Fried Shrimp Po-boy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - $9.50 This one was just ok. Too crunchy and dry. - Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - $9.75 This dish was actually pretty delicious. I'm cool off the grits though. - Fried Fish Po-Boy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) -  This was on the specials menu and it was pretty damn good. crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Price: Can easily $35 for two people. It wouldn't say its a steal but they are not robbing me. Overall: I'd say its a good place to try but wouldn't be a brunch place i crave for. A little too much fried stuff for me.

I came here again during the week and got seated right away, again at the counter, which I later regretted. The waitress didn't seem to like my friend (girl vs. girl). I tried the chocolate Beneighs, which were good, but I think they got over hyped for me because I thought they would be better. The food overall is really good, and this time I got a watermelon lemonade or something like that, which was excellent. I don't know if I can justify waiting 1-2 hours on weekends for this place though, it's just too damn small. Less than an hour wait I can deal with, but I have my limits. If I'm going to wait, I might as well go to Dottie's True Blue Cafe - I feel like it's a shorter wait for better food. Maybe if I got here super early?

Soo happy I finally experienced the wonder that is Brenda's! Came here around 12:30 on a Friday afternoon...waited about 30 min for a bar spot for 2. Totally worth the wait! But make sure you have plenty of quarters on hand...$3/hour parking, 1 hour max. Annoying!! Luckily there was a nearby cafe where the very nice man was willing to exchange our dollars for quarters. We got the Catfish Poboy with fries and the Hangtown Fry with grits and a biscuit. OMG the PoBoy was amazing. From the warm, crispy on the outside/soft on the inside bread, to the perfectly breaded catfish and the thousand island dressing...mmm heaven to my tastebuds! The fries were really good too. I thought the Hangtown fry was pretty good and interesting. I'm not a huge fan of fried oysters but I did enjoy the andouille sausage! The best bite is one with some eggs, some grits, and some warm crumbly biscuit. Buttery deliciousness! Couldn't come to Brenda's without getting a beignet, but by the time our beignets came we were stuffed. Wish I had known the traditional order came with three! First bite was like biting into a warm pillow. Words can barely describe. You gotta get it!! I saw a couple of savory beignets which looked really interesting...must try in the future. All in all a fantastic experience. It gets kinda messy so beware and have fun!

Amazing, unique brunch fare.  Southern comfort food at its best. The beignets are to die for, but don't get more than 1 per couple (they're big!). If you're out of town and visiting SF, this should definitely make your itinerary. Brenda's is a tiny and very popular restaurant, so be sure to get there early (I recommend getting there right when it opens).

The beignets are so fun and delicious. Each one is big enough to carve into 4 pieces for sharing. The $8 beignet flight, which comes with one each of the plain, chocolate, apple (like apple pie!), and crawfish (unlike any other beignet I've had! Yumyum) beignets, is a good way to sample all the flavors. I got the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was very well seasoned, but the cheddar grits were too much for me after a third of the plate. I still finished the whole plate of stringy greasiness though. Tried a couple of bites of my bf's andouille cheddar omelette and potato hash. Found it bland. Waited over 40min on a Wednesday at 2pm which is a really excessive wait, especially in an unpleasant area of town. I also smelled strongly of soul food for hours. I had to shower to get the smell off. Next time I am grabbing the beignets to go!!

I must admit this is not the place to attend when you're in a rush out the door. I adore Brenda's watermelon ice tea, her selection in omelets and her grits. Every time that I've had to wait for more than an hour to go through the magical black door, I sit down to a good cup of coffee and some homemade beignets. Soooo good! They have even accommodated my friend's needs who is gluten intolerant and diabetic. My only complaint is that they need a larger spot than the one that they have next to KFC. It looks from the last visit that they may expand their location, which would be ideal, but without this additional space you have to give yourself up to 45 minutes rain or shine, just to get a seat. Believe me you will never leave disappointed, just bundle up, bring the umbrella in case it looks like it's going to pour and you'll enjoy one of the best places for breakfast and or brunch in the city.

The line was long, but worth it. We came around 1 and thankfully only had to wait around half an hour. First things first, the watermelon ice tea is a must order. The flavor of the tea is complex. I spent a good amount of time smacking my lips trying to figure out all the spices that went into the tea. Our party shared the beignet flight. My favorite is actually the plain beignet. The apple and crawfish ones were pretty tasty too. I didn't try the chocolate one since I'm not a fan but my friends loved it. Beware though, the stuff is pretty filling so tread lightly. After all that fried dough, our appetites took a precipitous dive. I vacillated between the grillades/grits and the shrimp/grits. In the end, I decided on the former. I must say that I was rather disappointed by the dish -- the meat was dry and tough and the sauce's flavor profile was plain. The grits were creamy and yummy though. All in all, the service was fast and friendly and the food was above average. I am definitely interested in trying out the other items on their menu.

This is a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant that I was recommended to a year ago, and I went for fun and got the beignets. This should be the only thing to get (why would you get American food in a soul food restaurant, u know what I mean?) They were amazing. I got the crawfish beignet and my friend got the beignet flight (which has one of each type). sooo good. My issue is that it's a small restaurant, so there's a waiting list outside. wait-time kinda sucks but there's a bunch of Vietnamese markets around the area to wander around while you wait haha

We came to Brenda's for brunch one day. It's a small rectangular restaurant with two long rows of tables, one row against each wall. Once you enter, there is a giant chalk board on the right, where you put your name down for the wait list. We eventually sat down and started ordering a feast. The pancakes came out first. It was okay. I felt it needed a stronger butter taste. It was really bland. I still crave the ones I had from a restaurant in Hawaii, which will forever be my standard from now on. The eggs any way you like them were also okay, nothing too special. The real star were the Beignets! For those who don't know, it's basically fried dough in a pastry puff form. I got greedy and ordered the Beignet Flight because I couldn't choose just one to try. The plate came with one Plain, one Chocolate, one Granny Smith Apple and one Crawfish beignet. It looks all the same on the outside, but you have to cut inside to see the good stuff. My favorite was the Crawfish Beignet, which had chopped crawfish, drenched in a cayenne, scallion and cheddar cheese sauce. Delicious! The Granny Smith Apple one was also good. I was too full to get to the chocolate one, what a waste. It was Ghirardelli's melted chocolate too! I bet it was good though. I'll definitely come again for some beignets.

A nice spot for brunch in SF.  Crowded....got here at around 11 on a Saturday, ended up waiting about 45 minutes.  Come earlier for a shorter wait...come later at your own peril. FYI, street parking nearby is with a meter but at an astronomical $3 an hour....bring your piggy bank change. Try a flight of beignets for brunch to share between a few people and get a taste of what beignets you really love so you can order them alone next time, maybe. I was skeptical about the crawfish savory beignet, but it was actually tasty. The watermelon ice tea is generously refillable, and tasty! I don't usually like sweet tea, but I ordered it because I figured I'd have the quintessential southern tea and I was pleasantly surprised by how well the watermelon tasted with the sweet tea. All the food here is pretty solid from what I've tasted, and all the employees here seem to be really nice!  I would def come back, but the wait is a big drawback....I liked the food, but I dunno if  I can hang with the wait and the parking sitch!

It's hard to write a complete review when you've only tried one of the main dishes but when it came to the 2 eggs w/biscuit, grits and bacon, it was good but not necessarily as amazing as I've heard. I've heard the shrimp and grits is really good so I'd be willing to go back to try that. We went early, maybe 10am on Sat. and the wait was still about an hour. In the end I'm sure there are better places with less of a wait. Not quite worth the hype for me.

Went for breakfast/lunch last Friday. We arrived at about exactly noon, and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. However, we were glad that we waited. PROS: Although it was packed, the service was relatively prompt. The beignets. We ordered the plain, chocolate, and apple, and they were all DELICIOUS. The granola pancakes were pretty tasty--the granola had some dried cranberries in it. It was nice. CONS: Pancakes: I was expecting a lot more fruit and vanilla cream and a lot less pancake. (How can anybody possibly eat that much pancake?!) (If you like pancakes A LOT, this is a probably a pro for you, not a con.) The bench was a little weirdly high relative to the table. The chairs were at a normal height for the table, I think, but the bench side was slightly awkward. I would definitely go back, though, just for beignets. All my friends seemed to enjoy their food, also.

Delicious! But 4 stars because the place is really small and pretty loud. I remember the brunch being really good, well seasoned potatoes, and chocolate beignets were perfect! I got mine to go. I suggest getting their early so you can have better choice of seating. Don't want to be stuck in the cramped corner, between looking at the mirror (they have a huge mirror up on one side of their restaurant, probably to make the place seem bigger) or the wall. It's not a place you'd go if you'd want to impress some out of towners, and wan to show them the great San Francisco Bay! But still... food is quality, hopefully they will expand soon.

** 3.75 Stars ** I used a sick day, and figured I'd take advantage and finally try Brenda's, since I've been avoiding it on weekends due to the RIDIC lines. I thought on a Weds at 1pm it wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong. We waited a solid 50 minutes. I didn't mind too much, because my friends and I had time and I wanted to try the supposedly epic food. In the end, I had mixed (although mostly good) feelings. Watermelon sweet iced tea - HELLA SWEET, and awesome. Beignet flight - The crawfish beignet was far and away my favorite. I've heard/read amazing things, so maybe my hopes were too high, but overall I felt like they were a little dry and overly doughy. They were huge, but I'd rather have a smaller, more yummy beignet. Fried shrimp poboy - It was okay, not great. I liked the shrimp on their own better than I liked the whole sandwich. I was hoping they'd have one of their eggs benedict dishes on the menu. Coleslaw - Spot on. I finished every shred. Fried chicken - I tried a bite of my friend's and it was super juicy and tasty. Mmmm The service - It wasn't good. Not at all. In fact, it was really reeeally bad. =/ Usually that can totally fuck things up for me. But the food made up for some of it (not all). I'm sure I'll be going back to try some of the other menu items and have more crawfish beignets and watermelon tea. But I won't be rushing there.

A line out the door. A long wait list, so decided to order to go. They only serve Brunch during the weekend, I think the manager made an exception to let us order our shrimp po-boys. The staff seems very nice even though we just spoke to them. The food was unbelievable. The bread was toasted, lots of shrimp, and love the sauce. We were in SF so tried to pick a place to eat from the 7x7 big eats, 100 places to try before you die. We had yo wait like 15 minutes for our to go order, but Its so worth the wait. Would come back and try the brunch one day.

I absolutely loved my shrimp and grits.   But everything else was just not that amazing to me... I didn't care for any of the beignets (except the crawfish one), I was disappointed in the croque monsieur, and the oyster scramble was just ok.  The cappucino was also just ok. We got there at 9AM, so there was a relatively short wait.  The service was brusque, until my friend got the server to crack a smile inadvertently.  It's nice when your host smiles, you know?  It makes the place a little more relaxing and gives the place a little more of a pleasant character.  Everyone seemed a little stressed out and unhappy. It is definitely A-OK!  =)  Glad we did not wait for this & it was super sweet for my friend to pay for the excursion; it was pretty expensive though the dishes are large portions.  I would return, but not be chomping at the bit to do so.

How in the WORLD does this place only have a four star review?? I've been there twice and it has not been enough. On my first trip I tried their oyster po boy and their cheesy grits. My second trip included the grits, and some delicious baked sea food thing. I will now forever come just for the grits. Both dishes were clearly FRESH, DELICIOUS, and made with so much LOVE you would think your grandmother was in the kitchen. But those grits were the smoothest grits I have ever put into my mouth. Make sure you get a biscuit with WHATEVER you order. The ONLY thing is that there IS a wait when you get there most of the time but guess what?! THEY'RE EXPANDING!! People have put the price range at 2 dollar signs, but I get so full from SHARING two dishes that it's clearly worth it. I'm going tomorrow morning-hope to see you there!

The best way to get into this place is to come here early on a weekday. The wait for this place on a weekend is just ridiculous and I don't have the patience to wait 2 hours for food, no matter how good it is. We had the beignets sampler, the hanger fry, and grillades & grits. Everything had great flavor but what really stood out for me was the crawfish beignet. When I picture a beignet, I think of a fried doughnut (something sweet). So when I read reviews on the crawfish being the best... I was hesitant to try it. It has yummy sauce with the crawfish on the inside and spices on top to give it an extra kick. It's just really really good. The next time I come here I'll just eat a bunch of the crawfish beignets and I'll be a happy camper!

There is no place worth waiting two hours for a table.  I had a rough one here today after waiting for an hour I went in to check where was on the list enormous list and found that my name had been erased.  When I complained they were willing to add me back to the list but if I had not checked I would have been SOL.  When we were finally seated our server was hardly friendly.  We asked for some expert advise and got "everything's good" which really was not helpful.  When my food came out my order was completely screwed up.  Finally when the bill came out we asked to split on two cards with different balances.  They switched the cards and screwed up yet again.   On the bright side the food was good.  The crawfish beignet was tasty, the grits are really good.   All in all the food is really good, service was below average, and the wait was really not worth it.  If you can deal with sitting on the curb for 2 hours on the weekend check it out, otherwise there are tons of great places in SF to enjoy.

It's a very pretty little restaurant with efficient service and friendly staff. We had coffee & chicory, chocolate beignets, and veggie omelets with grits and toast and biscuits and hash. A plate of beignets is a meal in itself:  they're not the mini-donuts you'd get at Cafe Du Monde, but rather the size of large filled croissants, and there are three of them.  We were not brave enough to try the crawfish beignets.

Recommended by a friend a few years ago when it was the size of a college dorm room in in Japan (waaaay small) . I sat on a makeshift counter facing the mirror, and I had to watch myself eat! ( I guess I can work on my dining etiquette! ) The tables were sooo close that the waitress had to maneuver around the tables just to take my order! Haha thats what gives this place it's appeal as i was not going to wait for a better seat.... line was out the door and someone would have gladly snagged it!  Anyway i've been here a few times since then and they now have expanded the dining area to twice the size! I have had the omelets, the biscuits, the gumbo, fresh watermelon juice (must try) , and the red beans and rice! all were excellent....except maybe the red beans were a bit too "whole bean" instead of creamy  for me. The gumbo, however is some of the best i've had. I have been to the south and stayed for a few weeks trying different dishes. I am no expert , but I have learned what to expect!  Today for breakfast I had the "Hangtown Fry"  a dish made with deep fried oysters, bacon, and scrambled eggs. It was also  made famous in San Francisco! Saying has it that convicts on death row would order this meal as a last request.... hence the name "hangtown" It comes with some home fries  (just ok) and a biscuit.  It was very very tasty with a glass of their amazing homemade Bloody Mary! Hit the spot first thing in the .....mid morning! I love the coffee here too..... strong. Thank god i was not on death row so I can try some of the specials for lunch next time..... and the crawfish beignets

I came here cuz my friend recommended this place. So a group of us decided to try it out on a Saturday morning. We had a 30min wait which wasn't too bad for the 6 of us since the place is pretty small. I ordered the chocolate beignets and Hangtown Fry, which was fried oysters with scrambled eggs and bacon with potatoes and a biscuit. The beignets were soOoo yummy! Fresh and soft but had a nice crunch on the surface. The Hangtown Fry was deeeelicious!! The biscuit was nice and buttery and their homemade strawberry jam just made it even more irresistable. If it weren't for the sucky parking, I'd defnitely come more often.

Get there early, I'm talking around 8am. And the place is small, so it's better to go with 2 people, MAX 4. Do those two things and the wait won't be totally unbearable. That said, those crawfish and chocolate beignets = SO DELICIOUS. The biscuits are warm and extra delicious with the jam they have set out. Seriously, some of the best jam I've EVER had. The Watermelon sweet tea is refreshing. The main dishes I've tried: Granola pancakes - tasty Veggie Omelet - good but nothing mind blowing In the end between the beignets and biscuits, I end up so full I rarely eat my main dish. I am seriously considering just getting beignets and biscuits in the future and leaving that as my meal. I do desperately want to try the gumbo and a sandwich next time...all in all a great place if you time it right.

This place is a tiny hole in the wall. The seating is claustrophobic close, the wait is a year and a day and I LOVE THIS PLACE. Yes the wait took excess of an hour, yes Brenda's has a tiny location but it's all worth it for the FOOD! A friend and I ordered the beignet sampler, the shrimp and cheese grits, and the shrimp and goat cheese omelet. Unlike some cajun style dishes the flavors were balanced. The spices weren't overwhelming and everything was fresh. However, the star at Brenda's is the biscuits. I make biscuits from scratch all the time so believe me when I say Brenda's biscuits are the sh**! Big, fluffy, flavorful, and dare i say creamy?! It's like you're overweight southern granny made them for you from her warm country heart! Rules for Brenda's 1. Get there early. They close early and stop taking names around 10 2. Be ready for the wait. 3. Get the biscuits!!! 4. Try the chef's special for the day 5. Save up. It's not a bargain brunch place 6. For the love of God GET THE BISCUITS! They even sell the dough!

I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine with grits. The grits were cooked perfectly and came in a HUGE bowl. The tartine, which is an open-faced sandwich was so delicious. The gruyere cheese had a nice amount of stretch and the tomato-bacon relish balanced out the saltiness of the bacon and enhanced the flavor of the eggs. The watermelon iced tea is a must-try as well.

The first minute of the first visit was a let-down.  We walked in only to be greeted by the hostess with, "You know the breakfast service is over, right? We only serve it until 3."  (it was 3:05). So she pointed to the snack menu and since we were pretty hungry and we already invested $3.00 in the meter across the street, we didn't feel like searching for another place to go to and ended up agreeing to eat off the snack menu. Lo and behold the Kick-Ass Burger was THE best burger we've had in a long, long time.  It came with thick and juicy ground beef patty (cooked medium), remoulade sauce, perfectly toasted buttered bun, caramelized onion, and a choice of gruyere (+$1.00), egg ($2.00) or, if you're that hungry, both. The feeling is akin to discovering a hidden bonus stage in Super Mario Bros (circa 1988, before cheats are widely available on the Internet), because nobody ever mentioned a single word about Brenda's burger.  I'm pretty obsessed with lists and nowhere did this seriously kick-ass burger appeared.  Sure, everyone has heard of burgers from Nopa, Marlowe, Spruce, or Bar Tartine (which they sadly no longer offer)... but I can assure you that Brenda's kick-ass burger is no joke -- it kicks the other burgers on the ass. So the next weekend, we showed up right at 3.05PM on purpose, and the standard "You know the breakfast service is over, right? We only serve it until 3." was like music to our ears. As long as they still serve the same burger, that is.

I made it to test out the brunch at Brenda's on Saturday morning. For how small the place is, I was excited the could accommodate our party of 5 without a fuss even though the 5th came at the last minute. In the future, I would suggest a solo or double ride here. I was excited by the wide array of down home cooking. I will say before I rave about the flavors that I think this place has gotten a bit more desirable than anticipated and it somewhat showed in the service. I ordered beignets which did not come until the end, where the waitress suggested they make the perfect desert. They were cold but delicious. I also ordered the egg and bacon tartine with tomato sauce. It was very good, but I had attempted to get grits and was instead served cold potato hash. Much of the food ordered at the table came out at the wrong temperature, but the flavors were so good I find myself craving some warm tastings at an upcoming weekend. Major perks: The home made iced watermelon sweet water with unlimited free refills which was unbelievably good. The gumbo soup was great. Biscuits are to die for. I brought home the corn beef hash cakes to warm and eat later and it was the best hash I have had EVER to date. The minus two stars goes to service alone and the food off temperature, which is key after a long wait.

I wanted to like this place a lot. After all, I was hungry. It was time (or past time) for breakfast or brunch or whatever you want to call it. My friends insisted on going here when I was just minutes away from a short stack at the Pork Store. Instead, I was a short car-ride away from a long wait outside of Brenda's. Plus, you have to feed the meters here on Saturdays, which just seems wrong. It's the weekend. At least the counter will make change for you because the laundromat next door won't. After almost a half-hour wait for three people, we never did get a table. Instead, we were seated at the bar along the wall, which is great for catching up with friends given how loud all restaurants in San Francisco are. We tried to get our server to reseat us, without success. The servers apparently took their cue from the "French" in their name. I'll forgive a lot if the food is good, and my French toast was good, but nothing I had was great. I expected the side of ham to be great, and it was nothing special either. There are a lot of great places to get breakfast in the City - from fancy to downhome. I'll choose one ot those the next time I'm hungry and it's early (or not so early) in San Francisco.

I came here for an early lunch - quite the cute place with lots of character. I ordered the vegan Josephine, a yummy rendition of sloppy joe on a potato roll made with tofu. The sauce was nicely seasoned, it wasn't too messy, but napkins are necessary. It'd be nice to see some sort of Tofu Po' Boy on the menu, but the Josephine was just fine. Service was good - we didn't feel rushed even as the lunch crowd started to gather outside.

I love breakfast at Brenda's! I always start off with a plain beignet & take a chocolate one to go.  The French Toast with buttery toasted pecan sauce is to die for!  It's rich so you need a glass of chilled milk to wash it down!  Add a side of link sausage & it's the perfect way to start my day!

I'm aching to add an extra star for this place but will exercise some restraint and keep to a solid 4-stars for the simple fact that, while my meal was good, it was not "as good as it gets"... well, not just yet. In light of all the reviews of this place and let's just say, my very VERY flexible schedule at the moment (hello unemployment), I ventured to check out this so-called southern bell for lunch on a weekday. Surprisingly, the place was already pretty full at 11am and I can only imagine what the weekends are like. Anyway, everything on the menu and the specials board sounded mouth-wateringly good. I knew very little about the place and admit, I was a little bummed that french soul food didn't include fried chicken and waffles. *wah wah* Sulking aside, we ended up trying a flight of their beignets and I ordered their catfish pohboy. The Flight. Four fluffly (yeah, I said fluffy) pastry hot pockets that were pretty damn good. The plain, chocolate and crawfish were my favorites by far. Seriously, can you go wrong with ANY chocolate-filled pastry? The crawfish was really good as well but for the life of me, I could barely find a single piece of crawfish in them. If there were chunkier pieces in there, I think I would have been sold. Catfish Pohboy. This sandwich was really good. The fish was flavored, fried and dressed just right. The side of fries were also very good. And this is where that last star just fell short. The catfish was literally 1/4 of the entire sandwich and I felt like I was eating more bread then anything else. In the end, the food was still good and all the other dishes that I seemed to be drooling over looked amazing as well. I thought I saw french toast at one point and decided then and there that I definitely wanted to check the place out again. Portion size, or at least main component portion size (ie. crawfish in crawfish beignet or catfish in catfish pohboy), seemed to be my biggest issue with the place but then again, I'm a pig.

Since I can never seem to find good estimates on wait times, I thought I'd provide at least one data point for anyone else thinking of eating at Brenda's. The wife and I arrived at around 9:45 and there were about 10 parties ahead of us, of which roughly 7 were two people. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to get seated (we took the opportunity to go for a short walk, down to Civic Center Plaza and back). The meal took a little under an hour--we were out the door before 11:30. The restaurant itself is very quaint and nicely decorated. It is also very loud, as there is nothing on the walls or ceiling to muffle the noise of the closely-packed diners. We ordered a flight of the beignets to start, but quickly realized it was a mistake, so we just split the apple one and took the rest home. The crawfish beignet was really the only one that stood out to me. The others were "ok". My wife ordered the grillades and grits and we both thought it was very tasty. The portion was ridiculous--I had her leftovers plus the leftover crawfish beignet for dinner and was stuffed. I had the eggs & grits, and it was good, but not mind-blowing. I'm from a different part of the south (Virginia), so I probably have different expectations about some things than I would if I were from Louisiana.  For example, the biscuits seemed to have cornmeal in them; they weren't  bad, but not the kind of biscuit my grandma would make. Also, the grits were incredibly rich... I'm used to them being rather plain (where I come from, you make 'em rich as you eat by adding butter, mixing them up with your fried eggs, etc.). Speaking of eggs, my eggs "over easy" were really "over medium". I know this seems like a nit, but the runny yolk + grits is _so_ good. I guess I should've asked for them sunny side up. The watermelon tea was the most interesting part of the meal. I've never had anything like it before, but before summer fades I'll be looking for a recipe so I can try making some at home. Oh, and the coffee was really good, too, I'll have to try and track some down. Overall, I'm glad we went, but between the wait, the noise, and the particular interpretation of southern food, it won't be a high priority to go back.

I'm not a fan of chicory coffee, but this was smooth, strong & had just a hint of chicory.   Girlfriends & I had: croque madame, shrimp & grits & grillades & grits.  Everything was hefty & tasty in portion.  Cooked well, seasoned well & really couldn't ask for anything better.  We planned on trying the beignet flights, but was overly stuffed by the time we were halfway done.   Biscuits were heavenly and when I smothered in butter, wow. Fabulous casual cool

This place was OK. we waited 1 hour to get in.Husband and I were eager to try this place out and see what all the hype was about. I was completely disappointed. I'm not a fan of their beignets either.It's doughy and heavy for me.The texture is more like a dinner roll... Meh! The food is OK. there are more better breakfast/brunch spots in sf. It's a big no for me. Place is small. Not really good for big groups.

Yum. So good. I read the reviews... it's half way between where I live and my brunch-buddy's house. Seemed like a good idea. I got there early (luckily I managed to get out of bed by 10am on a Sunday) and while I waited for my friend to arrive I enjoyed the strong coffee. The people next to me were leaving so I asked them what they had. One had the banana bread pancakes but they were already sold out! After much deliberation, we finally decided to share two plates. I got the beignet flight (one of each flavor - plain, chocolate, apple, crayfish) and she got the andouille sausage omelet (with grits and a biscuit). 1. Beignets are now my new favorite food group. I wish I could make them at home, but alas, I'm not down with owning a deep frier. 2. If you go there you need to order something appropriate to put jam on. They have amazing homemade rhubarb jam. The staff were awesome. Very attentive! The other patrons were chill... even the line out the door people were cheerful. The only complaint of the meal was my friend thought the coffee was bitter. I like it strong and bitter, so it suits me just fine! After two coffees, one OJ, an omelet and 4 beignets (plus tax and tip, etc) we paid about $15 each.

First of all, I'm not a soul food expert by no means, BUT, I really loved this place.  When we arrived here, there was a line of people waiting outside (good sign); however, the wait time wasn't long at all... 15 minutes tops.  The food here was soulfully delicious and the atmosphere was cute yet very intimate.  I'm surprised how they can fit so many people in that tight little spot. So my 2 friends and I ordered a plethora of food of which we couldn't completely finish: (1) two eggs, potatoes, and biscuit with a side order of molasses ham, (2) half order of rice and beans with sausage - special of the day, (3) chicken sausage okra gumbo (4) chicken etouffee - special of the day, (5) hangtown fry (oyster and bacon scrambled eggs) with grits and biscuit, and (7) our beverages of 1 coffee and 2 sweet watermelon tea.  Total wallet damage came out to roughly $51 for the 3 of us.  Not bad at all.  Every bite made made my soul sing!! Lastly, the service was awesome.  I'm definitely coming back here again the next time I come for a visit!

Brenda, as the other 1000+ reviews have said, you are very good. Your beignets are good. Your french toast is good. Your po boy is delicious. But I cannot stand waiting in line for that long (1 hour+ at 11:30 AM on a Saturday) to have you. I refuse to fight for you amidst the crowd of tourists and little kids. So I will only order you as take out from now on.

This review may be a little biased, since I came with two boys from Louisiana. We waited for almost an hour and a half, definitely do not come in odd numbers, pairs are probably the best way to go.   What we ordered: -plain beignets, yum (to my knowledge at least, i have nothing to compare it to) -crawfish beignets, a lot of cayenne pepper on top, it was a little salty for my taste, but the inside was good, although i still dont understand the concept of a crawfish or what it looks like even -shrimp and grits special, WAY too much cheese -grillades and grits, i am not a fan of meat with that much sauce on it, but then again, what do i know about grillades. grits were tasty though, didn't taste the biscuit, but it looked delicious, it was also ginormous -catfish po boy, nothing special but delicious fries -community coffee, i was really into it, what the heck is chicory anyways, can i get it in coffee for the rest of my life, please and thank you -watermelon iced tea, tasty but very very sweet while it was interesting choice to eat, i think it may be a little to trendy for my taste. i am not big into the trendy restaurant thing, i was mainly tagging along with two southern boys who were willing to give this place a chance. sadly we were all disappointed.  the service was ok, the food was ok, the price is reasonable, the wait is ridiculous. but the bathrooms were clean and the food came fast.  also it was my first time eating anything remotely southern, so i had nothing to compare it to. basically, i would recommend this to people who like to go places that other people recommend based on how "cool" it is. i really like the IDEA of this place though. =(

A  nice addition to the Tenderloin/Civic Center lunch crawl, Brenda's is across from the Culinary Academy and a couple doors down from KFC.  A hole in the wall in the most charming sense of the phrase, with a fire-department sign that dares 40 occupants to be inside, but that has only 26 chairs total (we counted).  We had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2 at 12:40 p.m. on a Thursday, so size might turn out to be an issue for Brenda's going forward. It is open from 8-3, with breakfast served all day, and lunch service starting at 11.  Breakfast options include ommlettes, house-made biscuits, and potatoes or, ahem, grits!  French toast and pancakes are also available. The lunch choices include several sandwiches, including a fried shrimp offering.  Gumbo is on the menu too. Good, attentive service.  The ommlettes were nicely prepared, and the biscuits were excellent.  Portions were generous. The watermelon iced tea was good, but very sweet.   Gotta go back and try the gumbo and the beignets....

As every other SF Yelper has already said, this place is the straight dope. We had a rather long wait (1 hour) for a party of three, but we didn't expect much less than that since we arrived at 12:30 on a Saturday. We passed the time by refilling our effing parking meter with Susan B Anthony's and a quick snack at Lee's Sandwiches around the corner. We still managed to be hungry by the time we got our seats. The three of us all raved about our food. I had a creole veggie omelette, the others had totally awesome grillades and grits a cheese omelette. The grillades were totally awesome, very savory life roast beef with gravy and a little bit of creole mixed in. I tried just a drop of the gravy and regretted the fact that I don't eat meat. The biscuits were also awesome. They have fresh, home made strawberry jam on the table, but I think the biscuits were best without even extra butter. They were perfect. The grits were also delicious. I took fully one star off because the coffee was truly terrible. I'm not sure if creole coffee is naturally different (some times chicory is mixed in), but this was just not right. Way, way too dark (2x too many grounds?) and bitter. It sounds like they buy fair trade coffee, but maybe its just not good. Anyway, the coffee was the only blemish on the meal. Go there as soon as you can, seriously. Biscuits.

It is hard to believe, but my boyfriend pays MORE attention to YELP lists than I DO!!!  In fact, he was the one who had bookmarked this place for us to try for a late Sunday brunch/lunch.  The menu is very simple and down to earth (like all soul food resto menus should be) and it is tucked away in the Tenderloin/Civic Center area. Here are my observations: -Parking in that area is always a pain in the buttocks (What's new in  the city, right?) - Waiting, waiting, waiting....(Of course, I completely forgot that it was Mother's Day...but waiting is the NORM for brunch places that are popular) - Limited SPACE.  (Like many cute brunch locales...space is limited so wear DEODERANT AND expect to get cozy with your neighbors, especially if you sit at the BAR). - Food is finger lickin' good  (I had the andouille, cheese, scallion omelette with spicy sauce - YUMMMMY) - Portion size is more than adequate (I left with a doggy bag) - The beignets are GOOD, but NOT GREAT.  (The dough is pretty heavy and will settle like a rock in your tummy) - The price is right - moderately priced.  (1 order of beignets, 1 croque monsieur, 1 omelette, 1 cafe au lait = $25/sans tip) - The coffee....oh...the coffee...with chickory is OH SO YUMMY

I liked it but didn't love it. For the loooong wait, I'd hoped to have the brunch of a lifetime. We started with the Beignet flight. I liked the chocolate one, and was so-so on the others. Even though I have sampled beignets all over the world (well, Cafe du Monde in NOLA and the Kyoto train station). Fried dough not my thing so YMMV. The Grillades and Grits were good, I liked the tender beef with spicy sauce and the grits were flavorful. The biscuit and  housemade jam were fantastic! This is not the staff's fault, but the jackass people, that I am pretty sure jumped the line, really pissed me off. The servers were efficient and friendly considering how busy they were. For the wait time, I wouldn't go again, but if I lived the in area I'd do take out.

I came here for Easter brunch with the BF's visiting friend and his GF.  After all the hype, I was expecting a bit more so really this is a 3.5 star review. The space inside was cramped and as expected and service was quick. We ordered the flight of beignets for our table to start. Interestingly enough, I thought the crayfish beignet was the tastiest one. Then, I had the omelette with the sauage which was a little watery. I felt that the egg dishes from Dottie's was better. However, the potatoes really won me over. They weren't too mushy and I think there was a rue mixed in that added a big punch of flavor. I think my favorite thing from brunch was the watermelon ice tea. It was very cool and sweetened with just a hint of watermelon. My experience has left me in a conflict choosing between Dottie's and Brenda's. I guess I'll just have to try both again and decide!

Remind me not to come on a drizzly day or during the mad rush hour of lunch.  There were only about 5 names ahead of ours (mostly just 2's and a party of 4) so we decided to wait.  We figured it would only be about 20 minutes or so, but we ended up waiting outside in the rain for about 50 minutes. Our order: -Watermelon tea -Beignet flight: Plain, Apple, Chocolate, Crawfish -Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo -Egg and Bacon Tartine:  Bacon, scrambled egg, Gruyère and tomato-bacon relish on toasted French roll, & hash The tea was quite refreshing.  We had ordered the beignet flight, while the couple next to us ordered the crawfish ones.  Our server brought us over a plate of beignets and we dug right in.  It was a bit doughey for me.  As we cut into the second beignet, we noticed it too was a crawfish.  We quickly asked the server about our flights and she let us know that she got our order mixed up with the couple next to us.    No wonder they kept giving us the evil eye.  The waitress came out and corrected our order.  As the main entrees were served she came by and asked if I had ordered the po-boy which I just smiled and pointed to the table next to us.

5 star breakfast in every sense!  Write your name on the chalk board and wait.  Just do it!  You'll be happy you did.  Brenda's has excellent service, excellent coffee, and excellent food.  Not good, "excellent." Of course, one absolutely needs to try the Crawfish Beignet.  Yeah, at first it sounds weird for breakfast with coffee.  But, wow!  You can't visit Brenda's and not try the Crawfish Beignet.  Get it as a side. My order of the Granola Pancakes (I was craving pancakes) was super delicious and left me really happy.  They come topped with fresh fruits which actually were fresh fruits. (How often do you get "fresh" fruit that was "fresh" some time ago?)   For example, the bananas were perfectly ripe.  Not over.  Not under. Just writing this short review makes me want to return... and I will. Good luck with parking.  Just park at Civic Center and walk over to Brenda's.

Havnt been here in 2 years and I was surprised with all the changes! From a tiny room that filled not even 20+ people to double the original size.  Love the huge crawfish on the wall..and same new Orleans coffee can utensil holder. Food here is just plain old delicious and love to the soul! Tried their beignets topped with powder sugar..Yumm but my fav beignets is actually the crawfish..cheesy and delish. Pancakes are huge and fluffy and decadent! Came here yesterday for lunch..had to wait a little but people got seats fast. Ordered the jambalaya which was loaded with andouille sausages and chicken. Rice was a bit mushy for me but nice flavor and spices. Watermelon ice tea always a winner and their biscuits are the best!! Crunchy outside soft and verrry buttery inside..topped with strawberry jam along the table side and I'm satisfied! Just be prepared to run a few miles after dining there, but its worth it.

VERY GOOD EATS with specialties that could only be found and done right here. My GF and I were staying at the JW Marriott for her BDAY and we were only a few blocks from Brenda's. We researched bfast joints in SF and was given the choices of Dotties True Blue, Zazies, and Brenda's. We ate at Zazies the day prior and had a good experience (check my review on that joint). Since Dotties and Brendas were blocks from each other, we walked from our hotel and checked the scene. Based on the reviews, both had reported long lines. We came around opening time, and saw a huge line at Dotties, so we decided to go to Brendas. We got to Brendas as they opened and only encountered a handful of people there. An hour later, the crowds came. FOOD: -Watermelon Iced Tea: Wonderfully delicious. We had about three refills and a refill at the end of our meal which left us stuffed. The iced tea had strands of watermelon infused in the liquid which filtered through the straw. -Beignet Flight: Worth it to try the different styles of Beignets. By far, the Crawfish Beignet was the winner. The savory and slight spicy ingredients of the crawfish mixture inside the beignet made for one incredibly delicious combination. By reading the description, one would not think of the Crawfish Beignet as appetizing, but once you taste it you will be hooked. -Eggs Benedict with Catfish: Freaking amazing meal with various levels of flavors and textures. The catfish had the normal cornmeal breading however, the crust worked perfectly with the light texture of the catfish. The hollandise sauce was not overpowering and had a slight spicy cajun flavor. The meal was not drenched in the hollandise sauce which was a normally mistake with these dishes. Prepared wonderfully. What blew me away was that they used a biscuit rather than an english muffin to base the eggs and catfish on. The biscuit was by far probably one of the best biscuits i have ever eaten. It was light, butter, and baked perfectly. Amazing. SERVICE: Most reviews on this joint indicate that service is lack luster and off putting. For the most part, I found that true. The waitress were definitely not the most warm and welcoming. We noticed that none of them had a smile on their face. While they were not rude to us, we observed a waitress who was rude, short, and condescending to another customer. The customer was asking about specific dishes and the waitress told her " look, i could close my eyes and put my finger any place on this menu and it would be good, everything is good her." While that might be true, she was really rude and short with that customer. Despite the vibe of the waitresses, the quality of food definitely outweighs the service. It's not quite like the SOUP NAZI, but this place is worth try. Just order your food, enjoy it, and dont pay attention to the waitress, because they probably aren't or dont want to pay attention to you. ALL and ALL, VERY GOOD EATS.

After seeing this place on the 100 things to eat in SF before you die, I really wanted to come here! I love creole/louisiana style "soul" food and was anticipating this meal. I tried their chicken and sausage gumbo, oyster poboy, crawfish beignets, fried chicken and hush puppies. This definitely isn't health food, but it tastes good! I enjoyed their gumbo although I wish there were brighter and more distinct flavors - it felt a little heavy and muddled, although I enjoyed the tender pieces of chicken. The sausage retained a casing that wasn't ideal. The crawfish beignets were a little cheesy for my taste, but I enjoyed the dough itself which had a delicious elasticity. The oyster poboy was tasty but a little heavy with the remoulade. Their fried chicken is tender and juicy, but the crust a little greasy and soaked with oil. My favorite part was definitely the hush puppies. They were so good!! Crisp, light and puffy on the outside, soft and moist inside.. yumm.

I went to Brenda's around noon and did not even have to wait for a table.  I had the Croque Monsieur and a Dungeness crab beignet, which was a special probably due to it being crab season.  The croque monsier was really good, the cheese was melted nicely and the bread not too soggy.    The beignet was AWESOME ( see my pics ).  The filling was super tasty , my only suggestion for the beignet would be to have a bit more crab in it.  I found only about two lumps of crab.  Granted they beignets are not that big themselves but I LOVE crab and would have greatly appreciated a little more.  The service from the wait staff was OK but a gentlemen who appeared to be either the owner or manager paid much better attention to me.  Overall, I WILL be back and I can only hope they will have the dungeness crab beignets again when I'm there.

I loved the beignet flight (crawfish, ghiradelli chocolate, apple, and plain)!!!  It was so worth trying and sooo good!  The bf and I came a little after 430PM so it wasn't quite dinner yet and they said they're serving from their "in between menu" which was small.  Not too much to choose from but I knew I had to get the beignet flight according to the reviews on Yelp!  I ordered the Cornmeal fried shrimp po-boy sandwich with french fries and the bf ordered the burger.  Both were tasty and good.  Nice little place with fast and friendly service!

If you plan to come here to eat be ready to wait and bring all your laundry coins to feed the meters! The wait was no longer than 25 minutes.. ON A MONDAY! The establishment was very nice and cute with concrete walls that added a lot of character to the place. I walked in there and I didn't feel like I was in SF for some reason. Not sure why. Write your name on the wall with chalk for the wait list A must: Watermelon Ice Tea Apple  beignet -taste like mini apple pie in a thicker yummier dough Crawfish Beignet: yummy goodness oozing out! Shrimp and Grits:OMG! Get this if you are not afraid to gain the extra calories hehe. This dish starts off with grits on the bottom, melted cheese loaded on top, and then large size shrimp on top and bacon bits.. YUMMY GOODness Average/Ok: I got the Po'Boy sandwich with shrimp. It's yummy, but not like OMG yummy. Chocolate Beignet and Regualr Beignet. The thought of chocolate sounded great but gets dull after one bite. Service was good for a place being so busy.

Simply put, I like it. I definitely recommend the beignet. They are extremely tasty. I wasn't a fan of the chocolate but I should also say that I don't care for chocolate in general so don't let that influence whether you order it or not. The plain and the apple were my favorites for sure. I recommend this place. I think there are a few rough edges that may be ironed out with time and experience so I won't dock them based on those (yet.) I am in the minority on this, but I don't recommend the watermelon tea... I actually thought it was kind of gross.

Tried this for the first time today and it was as fantastic as the good folks here exclaimed in their reviews. We had the Shrimp Poboy, the Sloppy Josephine, the Egg and Bacon Tartine and the Andouille and cheese omelette and of course the biscuits and beignets. Alot of food, we couldn't finish it but we wanted to graze and it was soooo good. To avoid the discomfort of waiting outside for a table and noting that the place is so tiny I opted for take-out and the food was ready within 20 minutes of my call to them. You might do the same if you're not far/gotta car and are a party of more than 4.

After living in San Francisco for 5 years, I have grown lonesome for my southern cuisine like my Mama makes it. I only get a taste of gumbo, crawfish, etc. when I head back to Mississippi and that's once a year. I'm too busy most of the time to bother with whipping up the often labor-intensive dishes myself which can get kind of expensive too and I can't recall the last time I had a beignet. So when I heard of Brenda's through Yelp and decided to head over for a bite. Like I said, I'm waaay busy. I made the order simple. Plain beignets, fruit and cafe au lait to go. Since I arrived at 9:30 on a Monday morning, I was met with a smaller crowd than I had expected. I took a seat, placed my order and listened to the sound of classic blues and jazz filtering through the cozy establishment. I was happy to see familiar things like Crystal's brand hot sauce, ceramic jars of mustard and homemade preserves instead of jam or jellies. After 20 - 30 minutes I received my order. Maybe because I had cafe au lait, I didn't taste the "too bitter" flavor that others had been complaining about, so I enjoyed my coffee. I do wish there was more coffee variety though and sizes. I was very happy with my beignets. Light, flaky, oil-dripping and burning my fingertips, powdered sugar dusting my nose. Just like I remembered when visit my aunt in Louisiana or go to Cafe du Monde in the quarter. Like others, I really wish that Brenda's business does well and can expand into a larger space ... and maybe add some of my other french soul food favorites to the menu (quiche, gator soup, shrimp etoufette, etc.) I'll be back to try the poboys and the gumbo!

Oh dear lord this place is exquisite *torture* for me.  I have a gut condition that essentially keeps me from eating much of anything that turns into sugar.  And before I figured that out, I had a *massive* sweet tooth.   I came here for an early breakfast with my dear pal.  For the record, at 8:30am on a Monday morning, its not that crowded yet. But back to why this is torture.  I had to sit there watching my dear (evil) friend eat butter pecan french toast, and eat a biscuit smothered in peach preserves.  Granted, he was kind enough to allow me to try baby mouse sized portions of his food.  (Which was as amazing as it looked and smelled).  But seriously, when you've got a girl with a formerly huge sweet tooth, who can't indulge... frankly the egg and bacon terrine, while fabulous, wasn't quite as good as the temptation of the food on the other side of the table. Also, the waitstaff was kind enough to give me fresh fruit instead of grits or hashbrowns.  I know, blasphemy.  But I was seriously trying to keep my stomach from going nuts. Here's to a far-off day when I can have my own serving of seriously amazing french toast.

Until Brenda's, I've never waited over two hours to be seated for a meal.  But I really wanted to try this place, so I put in the time and ordered just about everything on the menu after we were seated: the po'boy, gumbo, beignets, grits, coleslaw, coffee... and they were all just okay, even with my empty stomach.   Still, I don't regret coming here.  I might even come back again. It just won't be on a Saturday, because no one will ever have enough coins for the meter.

Came here for a brunch with my friend this morning. First thing I noticed (which is usually a good sign) was a line out the door waiting at 10:30am. The place, though small, was packed... and there was still a line when we left - it's no wonder, too! By the time we got in (~25 minute wait), I was pretty hungry. We started out with a cup of the gumbo - I thought it was alright. Nothing too special, but it was tasty and a great way to start brunch. Next came our plates - she got the cream cheese French Toast w/ blueberry-brown sugar compote, pecans, and whipped cream. I had a bite and it was pretty awesome. I ordered the Creole Veggie Omelette with grits and a biscuit for myself and it was pretty good, too. The best thing on the plate though had to be the biscuit - the perfect texture combined with the absolutely delicious buttery after-taste... *drool*. If I had nothing else there, I would've still been happy! =P It was also cool that they had this apple-cinnamon jam at the table... I guess maybe they change it every once in a while because my friend said it was a different flavor last time. Add a little bit o' the jam and a tiny bit of butter on the biscuit and you have heaven in edible form. Woot! The place is a bit cozy for sure (probably not room for more than 20 or 25 people), but the food is great and the servers friendly. Also, my iced tea was NEVER empty - which is always a plus. Check out this place - the wait is well worth it! I definitely want to try their crawfish beignet next time - a table next to us got it and it looked hella good.

Definitely worth the wait! After many raves from my bf, I went here for the first time with a friend who was visiting from Seattle + a friend from the east bay. We got there on a Sunday in the a.m around 10-ish and waited for almost an hour. Good thing my car was parked literally right across the street from the door, so we periodically checked (while we were staying warm in my car) to see where our names were on the list, so we wouldn't lose our place. Although I wish I would've gone with a different order (I had some beef dish in really heavy red sauce - way too heavy for breakfast/brunch food), but I LOVED LOVED the potatoes, grits, and homemade muffin. The potatoes had so much flavor and the muffin was so moist and fluffy - YUM! My friend ordered the catfish eggs benedict and it was so DELISH! I later took home a to go order of ham egg benedict for my bf and it was fantasmic as well (the cheese grits tasted pretty tasty cold). Next time, I want to try the beignets. My only complaint is that its super tiny, but what can you do? We tried going this past Sunday with another out of town visitor, but alas there was still a line even with the pouring rain. Am I surprised? Not.At.All. There's a reason why there's always a line.

Waiting in line for 55 minutes for a single seat seemed a little absurd. With the effects of last nights outing lingering made it almost unbearable. I came close to giving up until I laid my eyes on the special: "Hang-town Fry" If you've never considered oysters and bacon in an egg scramble with a side of cheesy and creamy grits- Brenda's is the place for you! The food is HEAVY and RICH so be prepared to spend the rest of your day trying to convince your body to do you mind's bidding. Community Coffee (with chicory) is worth trying and enjoying. Sometimes in life good things are worth waiting for...

I went at 10:30AM and there was a crowd at the door waiting for an hour and a half to two hours. Right away I thought this place must be the bomb. So I came back another weekend at 8:30AM and there was a 30 min wait. Not too bad... This place must be REALLY good. Beignet Sampler = Delicious!  You get more bang for your buck on this dish. They use real chocolate and it oozes ultimate yumminess. Another good one is the Crawfish and cheese. The plain is good and the Apple one is typical. They should just discontinue the apple and come up with something different. I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine and it wasn't all that great.  Mainly an egg omelet folded over bacon and cheese on top of a huge crunchy french roll.  The hash was very heavy and soggy smothered in a southern type tomato salsa.  I'm more of a slightly crunchy home potatoes fan. I was slumped between 2 to 3 stars because the Beignets were awesome! I wouldn't come back for breakfast unless I'm craving Beignets.

visit #1 Came on the Saturday of President's Day weekend & arrived around 8:55.  The 2 of us waited a little over an hour! visit #2 Regular Saturday, arrived at 8:40 & the 3 of us waited 10-15 minutes! Even better that we found parking at a broken meter right in front!   The wait is definitely going to vary on the day & time you go.  It seemed to get super crowded around 9:30 or 10.  Be sure to bring a lot of quarters for the meter! Beignet Flight - my favorite was the Apple Cinnamon.  The plain was good, but maybe a little too plain.  Nothing stood out about the chocolate one.  Crawfish was good because it's a little spicy & different than the sweet ones.   Egg and Bacon Tartine - What's not to love about bacon, eggs, Gruyere and tomato-bacon relish on a toasted French roll?  Everything came together well, the roll was nicely toasted & crunchy and the bacon was crispy.  But after sharing the Beignet Flight, I was pretty full & couldn't eat much of this dish. Watermelon Sweet Tea - a MUST! So refreshing and not too sweet.  Free refills too!

Plain beignets were our favorite.  The Hangtown scramble (bacon, oyster egg scramble) was delicious.  Eggs benedict with catfish also delicious. Biscuits - awesome. Watermelon iced tea - really refreshing.  Exactly like it sounds, plus they put in some herbs.   Grits - AMAZING.  We only got the side dish and it was great.  Glad we didn't get the full plate of shrimp & grits;  that dish looked like a big bowl of cheese grits with a few shrimp on top, and that would have been too much of a good thing.

We waited an hour and a half to get seated, and then we waited another 15 minutes for someone to come take our order and for us to ask for water and drinks.  (Water is only served when requested).  Like seriously, guys.  I've had well over an hour to decide what I wanted to eat. We ordered: 1. Beignet Flight 2. Oyster Po Boy 3. Andouille and Cheddar Omelette I was actually really unimpressed with the beignets.  The crawfish beignet was very hard and very difficult to cut through, and when you finally slice through the beignet, there is hardly anything inside.  The plain beignet was the best because it was soft and fluffy, whereas all the other ones were rock hard, which makes me think they were over cooked? I really enjoyed my Oyster Po Boy sandwich.  It had the right amount of spices, and the bread was nice and toasty. We decided to get the potato hash instead of the grits with the omelette, and I would like to tell you to avoid the potato hash at all costs.  It was soggy and flavorless.  :(  The biscuits were great though!  I can eat a billion of them. tl;dr: long wait, over rated beignets, good oyster po boy sandwich, good biscuits, and avoid the potato hash.

Waiting aside, this place is a gem. Portions are big. Food is flavorful. Fairly priced. Nice staff. Winning combination. You almost forget you're in the tenderhood. Can't go wrong with the beignets. Always a good start with your friends. Egg dishes are spot on. Biscuits weren't too fluffy, nice crunch at the edges. Po' boy sandwiches satisfies your fried and savory cravings. Watermelon iced tea is refreshing. Now, I'm not saying this is THE rajing cajun place, but I've never left disappointed.

Every time I walk by Brenda's, I crave one of the crawfish beignets!! They are fantastic! I love the paprika/chili powder on top of the beignet, and the crispy exterior. The filling is really good too, although it would be nice to have bigger chunks of crawfish (they are small buggers though). I have tried all 4 beignets, and the crawfish definitely tops the list. Chocolate is good but too chocolatey (this coming from a diehard chocolate lover, but this just didn't float my boat... reminded me too much of a run-of-the-mill donut.) The regular is quite good as just a classic beignet too. The other food is good but not outstanding. I had the shrimp po boy. If you've followed my reviews, you'd see that I am a proud hater of the Top 100 7x7 list.. just kidding. But the list has been very questionable in my opinion. The shrimp po  boy is okay, but nothing to write home about. The bread is crispy which is a plus. You don't get a ton of shrimp, too much bread, bread halves fall apart. The breakfast items are generally dependable. Very buttery and rich. I've also tried the watermelon ice tea, which is nice to try once, and there are free refills!

So most of you who are reading this may know me and if you don't then let me tell you i get a bit twitchy when i have to wait for anything.  I mean when i say i am hyper, that is a vast chasm of an understatement. That said, i was a bit put off when i had to wait in line for Brenda's French Soul Food which was crazy as it was only 11am on a bloody Friday!  but after being calmed down by my girlfriend,i chose to stare longingly at the menu board. Anyway, once we got in i was blown away that the place was about as small as my living room.  Unfortunately, they were both out of Jambalaya and the toilet was out of service.  this is not good when you plan to eat some spicy food, let me tell you. That said, i do have to say the chocolate Beignets were scrumptious, but be careful, they are quite hot when right out of the oven. They were fun to share and almost filled us up. Moving on, we had the Egg and Bacon Tartine which was fresh, tangy and full of flavor.  It is like a sandwich, but better as it is more fun to cut up.  The spicy and sweet taste was great with their great coffee as the flavors  really complemented each other. OH OH!!! Don't let me forget, the homemade watermelon ice tea.  it was simply divine and they provided free refills! So in conclusion, i recommend this place, but get in early as the wait could be too much to bare.  I know if you are foodie you are used to this,  but keep in mind that maybe a coffee to go might be in order.

Tina T and I were out on another one of our excellent food adventures, when we had a hunkering for Brunch food! I was really excited because I love soul food especially grits! And boy did Brenda's have the best grits I've ever had! It was perfect! The texture was amazingly creamy and the melted butter gave it a mild salty flavor. Perfection!  My palate was completely satisfied until I got the beignets flight. Something really bothered me about the beignents. Maybe it wasn't my thing. I remember them being incredibly hard and the powdery dough outside wasn't making me happy. The crawfish Beignet was the best, but again the taste of the powdery dough really bothered me. I had an omelet with a very yummy sausage but it wasn't spectacular. I tried some of the Po Boy sandwich, and it was really dry.  I'd go back just for their grits alone, but other than that I don't think its worth it to be in line for 30 minutes. Sadly disappointed for the most part.

Brenda's French Soul Food is a small, cafe-type of place with breakfast/brunch food. The place has many tables that are squeezed into the small space and a "bar" type of place along one side of the wall. Also, bring many quarters for metered parking. 10 minutes for each quarter. After about an hour wait, my bf and I got seated to a small table next to two parties of two, each on our right and left. The proximities to both tables were just kind of uncomfortable for me. It was almost like everyone had no choice but to eavesdrop on everyone's conversation. Food - We ordered an omelette with grits off the specials menu and the Crawfish Beignet. Special dish was okay. I don't really like grits, but have to admit it went well with the oyster, bacon, and mushroom omelette. The beignet was something new. It was pretty good, just not something you eat a lot of though. The paprika on top, I think it was paprika (I don't cook often nor do I know much about spices) complimented the beignet. I would say that it was a good new experience, but don't think I will return on my next visit to SF.

I was dying to try Brenda's when i had jury duty... but lunch breaks were not long enough! So when I finally made it, guess what?, Hour long wait! UGH!!! I came with my BFFY and a 3 year old monster/ frenemy (How do you shut a 3 yr old up? hahah you can't ...at least not legally). The order... -Beignet flight (the savory and plain was the best) -Oyster poor boy w/ fries (nice big chunks of oyster. I ended up eating just the oysters and left the sandwich... there was way too much dressing "sauce" on it) - 2 eggs anyway- now really worth the trip for. - two fluffy pancakes (and yeah they looked fluffy) Over all. good but really not worth a wait... and crampness we were seated by the door, and even on a sunny warm day in SF...it was windy which made it feel cold. every time we slightly closed the door... it was open right back up. I felt like i couldn't move for fear of the condiments and utensils would fall off the table.

I was an early riser one weekend and made it to Brendas @ 9am...no idea how that happened :) 5 min wait!! I've skipped Brenda's for a while avoiding the line and ended up doing the same thing at all the other popular breakfast n brunch spots in the city...soooo even though I didn't wait this time around - I think it's certainly worth it. The beignets are def my favorite in the city...with crawfish in the lead! Enjoy!

Holy hell that was yummy! Headed over to Brenda's on Sunday "morning" around noon. I thought that maybe we had beaten the brunch rush. Nooooo. At Brenda's the brunch rush NEVER ends :) We waited a good hour for our table, and my expectations about what goodies were to come kept increasing. It better be the best thing I've ever had for an hour out in the drizzle. It was! The service was super nice, the atmosphere is adorable, the food is creative and super tasty, the beignets were AWESOME, and I got to eat oysters for breakfast! Next time I go back I'm definitely going to try the crawfish beignets. This time we had the gala apple ones, and I would highly recommend them. One tip...if you're stuck waiting for a LOOOONG time, there is a Philz Coffee on Van Ness about a block away. We headed over there to get our coffee fill so we weren't as cranky :) Can't wait to return!

First time there, I was raving about this place...5+ stars.  This is the shit, recommending it to friends and family and couldn't wait to get back to Brenda's and try their other selections. So the first time there, I had the shrimp and grits.  At first bite, I was in awe.  But the last few bites were hard to muster-it became too creamy and buttery for my taste.  My nephew ordered the eggs benedict with the mollass-ed ham.  That was awesome.  The eggs were done right, the biscuits were flaky-not all dried up with their hollandaise sauce. The reason I'm giving this place a 4 insead of a 5 is because the second time around, their eggs benedict weren't as good as the first time.  I had brought another person here and she ordered the same thing and she was dissapointed as I was.  The eggs were ok but the bisuits/sauce were not all  that.   Oh yeah, for you surburbians and visitors afar, bring coins for parking-meters for days.  Also the watermelon iced tea isn't what its all cracked up to be.  The wait can sometimes deter you away, as the place only seats maybe 20-25 people at a time (tiny place) and last time I went, I waited for about 35 minutes-make sure you bring lots of coins!!!

I was seated at Brenda's within minutes of putting my name on the list. Sure I was by myself and it was lunchtime on a Friday but what else are you going to do when you've dropped off your car in the tenderloin on a weekday morning? The food did not disappoint. My goodness. I feasted on the pumpkin spice pancakes. They were like mini-loaves of pumpkin bread, infused with carmelized all spice-butter clusters, candied pecan and of course, pumpkin. They were substantial and I was happy to take them to go for breakfast at work the next morning. Luckily a friend told me to get a biscuit to go because they are not to be missed. She was so right. Light, flaky and buttery all at the same time, Brenda's biscuits are delectable. Even if you think you're full, you'll be amazed at what this biscuit will make you do. Efficient and cheerful, the staff was great. I was in and out in about 35 minutes. I guess that was a good thing for members of the growing line outside. I plan on going back for some savory samplings off Brenda's menu. The beignets looked amazing as did the gumbo.

I'm SO happy I found this place. It is so wonderfully delicious! Friends and I took the MUNI from SFSU and walked from our stop to here on the suggestion of yelp. I'm about to cry tears of happiness because not only do I love French food, but when I saw the size of the beignets, I nearly fainted.  They were so pretty and looked so delicious. It was a grueling wait as the place is really small, but WHO CARES. I was so hungry! When I looked over the menu, I saw that there was a Croque Monsieur (Ham, Gruyere, and bread) with a side of fries. That looked so goooood, but I asked our waitress if I could have a Croque Madame (Croque Monsieur with egg). She said, "No problem!" That won a million extra points for Brenda's. My friends ordered the granola pancakes and French Toast, both good AND filling!. Oh! Forgot the apple beignets! I would've gone for the traditional (because they're just that good alone) and slabbed on the homemade compote/chutney they had at the table (it was apple cinnamon!). If I could make a suggestion, Brenda's...instead of Ghiradelli beignets, could you make Nutella filled beignets, too? (:

Spending a weekend in the Bay Area, I asked some friends on recs for good l/brunch time eats in the city, and survey says "Brenda's" After reading a few reviews I found this combined a couple of my favorite things:  breakfast + cajun food. Ever since moving to Los Angeles, I've had the devil's time finding a decent cajun joint, and decided, if I have to drive another 350 miles to find one, might as well be this. Located in the Tenderloin district, mere blocks away from City Hall, I went on a Fri lunchtime during the holiday weekend.  While the brunch menu was in effect, having missed traditional straight cajun fare, I opted to go with the normal lunch option.  I decided to treat myself to a cup of their signature gumbo as an opener, nice savory and thick broth was a great way to break in the taste buds.  I followed this with a chicken ettouffee and some crawfish begniets.  While the etouffee was very good and more or less what I expected, I didn't know what to make of the crawfish begniets, usually more of a sweets fried donut.  This spicy/savory version was interesting, but I felt lacking in the meat filling and a little too much dough.  Normally this would be no problem if it was the dessert variety but I felt this doesnt work as well in the savory type. This place is tiny and very easy to miss if you don't know to look for the neighboring Taco Bell.  Also the lack of seating explains the long waits people can experience especially during weekend brunch hour.  My advice, if you can go for the weekday lunch hour if you can, but if the weekends are all you have, then arrive early or be prepared for up to an hour wait. But the wait will be oh so worth it.  Thanks everyone for opening my eyes to Brenda's.

After all the hype and the wait, I was sorely disappointed.  My group of 4 were told the wait was 1 hour but it turned out to be 1 hour and 45 minutes...yeah, this place is POPULAR.  Perhaps that built up my expectations? Before I go on to describe the lackluster dishes, I have to highlight the watermelon sweet tea.  I love watermelon to a fault.  I have it nearly everyday in the summer time and this tea is AMAZING.  To top it off, they give you free refills on it. Okay, now on to the meat of the experience...Between the four of us we had: -2 different eggs benedict dishes, one with grits and another with veggies -2 crawfish beignet appetizers substitued as mains I had one of the beignet orders and I was not blown away.  It was 90% dough and 10% crawfish.  I was full after one beignet since I was so carboloaded.  It's an appetizer for a reason.  You can't really eat more than one and if I were to go again, I wouldn't want to eat a full one on my own.  Best to share that dish. I sampled one of the eggs benedict and found it mediocre.  Disclaimer: I'm not an eggs benedict fan but I can tell that Mama's is better.  So is Blue Jam's (in Melrose, LA).  The grits were quite tasty, though.  A bit too much cheese so if I were you, I'd order the cheese on the side or just sans cheese entirely.

Of course, we had to start with the beignet sampler - four fluffy pillows of pastry piled high on a sliver of a platter, dusted with powdered sugar or chocolate as appropriate. One was a plain beignet with powdered sugar. Sweet on the tongue, with an airy flakiness to it, yet dense enough to be a beignet. Another was chocolate filled - an obvious delight. The third was apples - a twist on apple pie meets donut. The best one though, was the savory beignet, stuffed with crawfish. The filling hit all the right spicy notes, with just the creamy texture without feeling like a chicken pot pie filling.

The only time I came here was a year or two ago, so this review is long over due. This is one of those over hyped up restaurants which turn out to be a disappointment in my opinion. My friend and I wanted to try the beignets, po boy, and one of their omelets. The beignets were such a downer. These are what they are supposedly known for, but they weren't good at all! We order the one where they give you one of each beignet to try. All of them were super dense and dry. Last time I checked, beignets are suppose to be light and fluffy. Their omelet was also just whatever. Nothing special about it. The only good thing was their po boy, but I don't think I'd make a journey across town just to get their po boy. I feel like this placed is over priced to get some mediocre breakfast. Save your money and just cook yourself a homemade breakfast!

We ordered several dishes here. The overall quality deserves 5 stars except one dish: BFC (fried chicken). We had: - Beignet Flight - Oyster Flight - Smoked Pork Rillettes - BFC Highlight: - Watermelon iced tea is a must-have! - Beignet flight is excellent! The crawfish beignet is really special. DON'T get scared by the red chili powder on top of it. It only adds slight spiciness to enhance the flavor. A must-have! - Oysters are broiled juicy. Taste good but not outstanding. - Pork rillettes is simliar to french pate. Very tasty. The watermelon pickle that comes with the dish is extraordinary! A must-have! - BFC comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken. The skin is not crispy but hard. The meat is not marinated enough so it tastes meaty, plain, and dry. Not recommend.

Long wait - but worth it! I was here with a group of 9 friends, so we already had to wait quite a long time, since it's a small restaurant, and we're...a lot of people.  We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night, and waited about an hour or so - we stayed though since every person who walked out of the restaurant would say "that was rather delicious" and every time that door opened I started to salivate from all the delicious smells.  Regardless - we were all seated eventually and fooding ensued. I got the shrimp and grits - deliciously flavorful, semi spicy tomato sauce with shrimp and these amazing cheddar grits that melted in my mouth.  For $13, I was stuffed, and satisfied.  I also tried some other things on the table - the fried chicken is what my friend claims to be "the best fried chicken she's ever had" - pretty moist and perfectly crisp yet soft on the inside.  The crawfish and pork pot pie was pretty delicious - I still can't put my finger on all the ingredients in the pot pie, but it was a burst of flavor.  The mac and cheese was super creamy and collard greens deliciously bacon-y and cooked to perfection.  A lot of my friends got the broiled oysters which were huge and delicious ($2.75 each) with a kick of spice and lemon, and the crawfish beignet was savory, but a bit doughy.  My one sad point of the night was all I was really craving was Jambalaya, which was one of their specials of the night, but it sold out by the time we were seated...also, sadly I was too full for dessert but they had a banana chocolate bread pudding on their specials board that I was dying to try! Some worthy notes: If you're craving wine, there is a wine list, but it's not shown outside.  Also, for those vegan/vegetarians out there, there isn't a huge selection of items on the menu that don't have meat, but we discovered that there is a vegan sloppy joe-type meal that can satisfy your taste buds. Overall - delicious and I would love to come back in the future!

Breakfast is so worth the wait.  The apple beignets and catfish benedict were really good. oh, and the watermelon tea..... to die for! However, I think their new dinner menu may possibly top their breakfast.  Is it possible?  I think so.  The crawfish beignet was the perfect bit of flavor explosion.  The gumbo was like mardi gras in my mouth.  We didn't think it could get better and then our main entree's came out.  The BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) was perfectly fried chicken with biscuits that melt in your mouth.  The shrimp and grits were a rich, bacony, delicious combo. Then to top it off, the prices were crazy reasonable.  Definitely recommend this place.

Beignets!!! Brenda's was the first stop on my all day foodfest run all over SF..Me and my foodie partner didnt want to stuff ourselves silly so we came to try what they were more famous for the beignets..We shared a flight of them which came in a plate of four. They were big and doughy with different fillings inside. There was the orginal, cinnamon and apples, chocolate and crawfish beignets...We both thought that the crawfish was outstanding~! It was a gooey filled cheesy center with the perfect amount of crawfish inside..Next time I think we will just order only the crawfish beignets althought I was also fond of the orginal one as well.. We also shared the croque monsiuer and that was just okay, a little bit too rich for my tastes...The refillable watermelon iced-tea was absolutely refreshing. The restaruant itself is small, and it seemed like they kept on rushing us to order so that they can fill up the seats for the next guests, thats understandable but just didnt like the snotty attitude that came along with it.

probably my quickest review, my friends and i went in to this place for the beignets because where we live, the closest place that makes them reallly good is a nice little drive, so when we searched from our hotel we saw Brendas was only a few blocks up. the beignets were delicious. two of us shared the regular ones, and myself and another friend shared the combo of the regular, apple, and chocolate. they were extremely good, i only wish that i could get them again and not have to drive 400 miles. as we were waiting for our order to go, we saw a little sign that promoted the sweet watermelon house tea. we instantly got two and it is amazingly good!! chunks of the water melon and apple inside of the sweet tea certainly leads to the visual aesthetics of the drink, and im sure it helps with the flavor also. that, and you can eat the watermelon slice afterwards. we didnt order any real food, but im sure just by the smell as we walked in that it is quite delicious as well.

didn't live up to the hype for me at all. maybe it's because i'm not used to heavy southern food... maybe it's because i waited too long to be seated... who knows. got the beignet platter, an omelette of some sort and  some steak breakfast type dish. the main dishes were way too salty and didn't have a good balance of ingredients, i.e. too much potatoes, not enough tomatoes. the beignets was the best dish we ordered and we couldn't even finish it because everything else was too filling. i wouldn't come back here unless the wait was less than 20 min.

I ordered the catfish po'boy sandwich and my friend ordered the vegan sandwich. My catfish sandwich was huge and very crunchy. However, it didn't taste especially special so didn't think it was worth the cost. Be ready to pay at least $11 to get out of the door. It comes with a side of fries or coleslaw. I think they need to have more sides for customers to choose from like mashed potatoes and green beans. My friend thought the vegan sandwich didn't meet expectation, because it comes with burger buns instead. How come they didn't call it a vegan burger instead then?

Went for the  pride parade last weekend, stopped off here for breakfast/brunch. They were super busy, waited for about 30/40minutes for a table, but well worth it. Me and my better half ordered  the chocolate beignet, thinking it will be one single beignet, and the waitress came out with this plate of three huge beignets. They were so yummy, oozing with chocolate...we barely finished the two, the third we took home for later. For the main dish we had egg benedicts, one with fried catfish and other with fried chicken, they both were delicious. The stand out for me was the side of  grits ..." artery clogging goodness" This was my first time trying Southern food(ever), and I was not disappointed. I think I have found my new "indulge yourself" favourite dish: grits...

I would say great value for money, depending on what you order. I didn't find the breakfasts to be anything spectacular but some of the dishes are insanely good and because of that, I eat here about once a week and I'll always take friends new in town for a meal here. The brie salad is one of thee best I've ever tasted.  The fried chicken is excellent. The beignets are LOVELY!!  I had the crispy pork belly special dish and it was cooked perfectly. The restaurant itself is cosy and the decor is very cute!

We ordered a fish po' boy = good, shrimp and grits = very good, watermelon iced tea = very good and beignets = good (but huge). When we came we were very hungry and by the time we were done we were beyond stuffed. If you want some delicious food for the soul this is a great place to consider.

Had breakfast today -Thursday at 8:45 am.,  a little tight but  very comfortable, they are expanding now and have moved into the larger space which will combine with the smaller in the next few months. The place is a winner on many  counts, wait staff/service,  ambiance, food  and especially prices. Not that it is cheap but so worth it and you do not need to spend a lot of money if you are not feeling like a big plate of food. There are a lot of options. We started  with: Watermelon ice tea - Killer....  they should bottle this. Beignet Flight: one of each of their beignets - Plain, Molten Ghirardelli Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple with Cinnamon Honey Butter, and Crawfish with Cayenne, Scallions and Cheddar. All were great The Crawfish w/ Cayenne was really good..a  couple of those for lunch and you are set. We had the Hangtown fry-$ 11-  very tasty fried oysters /  Crispy oyster, bacon & scallion scramble, with grits or hash, plus cream biscuit or toast and Shrimp & Goat Cheese Omelette     $ 10.00 With caramelized onions, topped with tomato-bacon relish. This was also quite good- The relish was one thing I would work on. I don't think it helped the combination that much. Coffee looked  really rich in large mugs, but  we did not have any; I would definitely go back for lunch  the menu looks full of options from large to small &  veggie  to meaty The place has great potential for franchising or at least duplicating, there is so much to like and it is a cultural experience that has export value.The ambiance is very NOLA with the Cafe du Monde cans used as table containers for the pre-wrapped flat ware. Check this place out some morning or weekday lunch  cause I'll bet it's crowded on weekends.

Found a new favorite brunch spot in my area. Took my parents here for brunch this AM. There was a wait, but it was well worth it. The beignets are amazing the chocolate and crawfish are def the standouts.  I had the bacon and gruyere cheese tartine with tomato relish. It was soooo good, I wish I had a bottle of that tomato relish to slather on my eggs at home. Also sampled the andouille omelet, grits, and shrimp and goat cheese omelet. The coffee was also great, called Snooze I believe from Guatemala. Oh yes and do not miss the biscuits.

For my first visit, Brenda's was a good experience but I was not completely wowed either. There is something a bit timid about this place. The waiter perhaps... I don't know. I really enjoyed the biscuits and for that alone I would go back. Now, I only tried a very simple breakfast with a goat cheese scrambled eggs and grits, and it was pretty good, but I have had better eggs before... They were a bit dry. Gosh I feel like I am being so picky but... Of course I will go back and taste something else and see if my rating changes. The watermelon tea was very good, a bit too sweet perhaps, but the refills were welcomed with open arms! And I loved how they had apricot jam at the table, with my biscuit it was just perfect. The grits were of yellow corn, and I usually prefer white corn grits and more runny and less oily, but oh well, I am not a grits expert, and it was really good regardless. Next time, I will try their coffee, and pick out something from their specials. Also, for a lunch I will have to try their sloppy soy joe thingy, sounds yummy!

This is my new favorite place. It's small and cute. The service was friendly. The food amazing! The biscuit's literally melt in your mouth! The beinget flight offers you a taste of the original, apple, chocolate, and savory crawfish. I am unable to pick of favorite. Really a small piece of heaven in a tiny Tenderloin restaurant. Can't wait to find myself there again.

Update: 23-July-2008 While I've not been back, I did want to comment that the owner was kind enough to send me a personal reply to my post below - suggesting (for me at least some impossible) times to come in when there's less wait. Now *THIS* Is the kind of thing that would inspire me to brave the wait as the food was good, but to see that an owner cares enough to make the time to write, that impresses the hell outta me and definitely makes me more willing to (suffer) brave the lines/waits again and give it a second shot. If you, unlike me, can make the prior to 09:30am queue, then she suggests you'll be sitting pretty at a table in no time. I need an SF based GF now who likes to get up early, will haul my sorry ass outta bed and then we can both make the pre-10am rush  ;) --------------------------------------------------­--- Worth the wait? I don't think so. I was excited to try this place after seeing all the Yelping and other reviews; I was prepared for the wait and while usually not a long waiter, as I've rarely seen any place worth the wait, I thought "OK...". Once again, that belief is born out here: the food is good, hardly great and thus, worth the wait. It's a cramped, tightly packed environment. I had one of the daily specials: the molasses pork chop w/ sweet potato hash, biscuit and 2 eggs. The pork was extremely sweet more so than I had anticipated and the hash was good. I must admit that the biscuit was excellent and I'm sorry I used it for my eggs as I would have loved to try the home-made jam on it. I'd go back and try it again, as I always believe in a second chance to really impress, however, I'd never do that wait again - not worth it. If you're in NYC, go to my old favourite: Acme Bar and Grill - now THAT'S real good cajun cookin' worth any wait and every bite!! YUM!

I've been here twice, the first time was good. The 2nd time, not-so-good... so they average out. Good - Hang Town Fry: eggs, fried oysters, bacon - how's that not good? Add some Crystal hot sauce & you've got one damn good cure for a hang over - Coffee: strong & delicious Bad - Watermelon Ice Tea: people rave about it, but it's SUPER bland - Service: Servers are rude & this past time a server gave our table to someone else because they said they were mistaken about the name (WTF???). Here's something else, if I have to ask you for water 3 times, something's wrong. End result - I'd go here again if people I was with wanted to, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

I landed at SFO to attend YouTube Live at about 8:00am and I had hours to kill. I hopped on Bart and fired up Yelp! on phone.Cajun for breakfast? Sold! I got off at Civic Center and walked a few blocks to Brenda's. Small crowd outside but just me so I was seated immediately at the wall counter. Smallish place packed with people and conversation. Great servers although a little overworked. I got a cup of gumbo to start and the crawfish beignets. Both were excellent - the gumbo had a nice sprinkle of scallions on top and the beignets - cripsy and stuffed with crawfish and cheddar - left my fingers covered in cayenne. My bill was around $10. Great start to the day.

Be warned that this place is small and on a weekend, you will wait. I had the Egg and Bacon Tartine which was good. The beignets are good, not traditional sized or taste, but good. They have have some imaginative fillings which is a fun twist. We noticed that a lot of things have tons of sugar, more than any place in New O. Still, a fun place and worth a try.

You say " beignet," I say," I'm there!" It's "unfortunate" that "Katrina" had happened a few years ago, but  it seems "fortunate" that the Bay Area has been blessed with the reward of their creole down-home cuisine. My eating buddy and I had conveniently stumbled upon this joint. With only a 40 person maximum, we were able to beat the breakfast/ brunch crowd and fix our appetites on French Soul love. My buddy had the beignet flight consisting of one original, one granny apple with cinnamon honey butter, one filled with ghirardelli chocolate, and one crawfish beignet with cayenne, scallions, and cheddar. I had the pleasure of tasting two of them. The plain beignet was just as fabulous as I remember they always taste when I had such an opportunity. The crawfish beignet was spicy, delicious, and savory. Judging from the two, I am convinced that the other two will not fall short of delicious. I had the grillades and grits consisting of braised beef cutlets with spicy Creole gravy served over grits. This was a perfect combination of hearty and filling. I substituted the eggs for bacon and chose the biscuit. The bacon was a thick cut apple-smoked extra crunchy treat that supplemented this already comforting meal. All I can say is "Aw Lawd!" The biscuit alone is enough reason for many more revisits. They were about 4" in diameter and about 2 1/2" thick, and they were fluffy, delicate, and  unmistakably rich. I don't know about you, but in order for my day to come into a complete circle, a cup of coffee must accompany me at some point of the day to suffice my caffeine addiction. This was no ordinary coffee. It possessed a viscose, syrupy nature. It was like a french drip coffee echoing  distinctive notes of chicory and bayou. Even as I added cream to tone down the strength of this "community coffee, " it only only spoke to me in voodoo tongue saying, "You have eaten, now drink me, and once you have accomplished this, it is then that you will be merry. " And content was I as my day progressed while longing for another beignet, or just another biscuit, and more of this delectable food. Bon appetit chez-Brenda.

I'd been planning for months to come here, but my plans always fell through at the last minute.  Finally was able to go, but the experience was a bit disappointing.  First, the wait was horrible. I think we waited an hour and a half to two hours?  That was our fault though for coming with a big group so I didn't take any stars off for that. But the food was also disappointing.  My friend recommended the gumbo, but unfortunately, it was extra salty that day and just wasn't great.  The dish I ordered, some beef dish with gravy, eggs and grits wasn't good either, with the exception of the grits which were great. Makes me want to make/buy/order grits more often. The beef itself was tough and dry. Sadness.   We did order the sampler of beignets which were pretty decent. The crawfish was really good, and the chocolate and apple-filled ones were yummy as well. The plain one I could have done without.  All in all, I'd come back to order grits and the crawfish beignets to go, but I don't think I'd care to sit down and eat there again, unless there was no line and I was only with one other person.

I love Brenda's.  Their food was amazing and reignited my love of breakfast.  Definitely worth the wait. Our table got the beignet flights.  They were all amazing, but both the crawfish and chocolate ones were true stand-outs.  I could gorge myself on these! For my entree, I got the shrimp / goat cheese omelette.  The tomato-bacon relish gave it a nice acidity and blended well with the buried mound of caramelized onions, goat cheese and shrimp.  I loved the biscuit and home-made strawberry jelly.  I even liked the grits, which I never thought I would say before. And to drink I got the watermelon iced tea, for which we got unlimited refills. The only downside is that you should be prepared to wait.  I came at 11am on Monday with three others and still had to wait an hour.  2-tops come and go pretty often, but large groups may take a while.  I'd suggest walking over to the Peet's one block down and one block over on Van Ness for some coffee.  I feel confident in saying the wait will be worth it.

My dearest sister and her BF took my husband and I for a brunch at this little hole-in-the-wall and since the place is tiny, the wait was long.   Since sis recommended us to try this place, we just let her order what she thinks we should have (apparently, she frequents this place).  First came the refreshing watermelon sweet tea.  Then plates starts showing up with Chicken étouffée or gumbo, beignets flight, crocque monsieur, mac and cheese, biscuits, po-boy's sandwich, and the scramble.  Since the food was really rich, a little goes a long way.  We were stuffed before we know it, but kept shoveling food down. What stood out for me: Gumbo, crayfish beignet, biscuits with their strawberry jam and butter, and watermelon sweet tea. The rest of the food was good, but not great.  Nonetheless, I will go back because the food was above average for the most part and service was good. If you are claustrophobic - definitely order "to go".

45 minute wait at 9.30 on a sunday morning. It's worth it. Had the catfish eggs benedict. Good flavor with the hollandaise. They use a biscuit instead of an english muffin...very nice touch. This was the best part of breakfast. Coffee with chickory still tastes funny to me...like mixing coffee with dirt. I didn't like it in Nola, don't like it here. Beignets - this is where they lose a star. Very heavy, very dense, like fried wads of goop. Got some super crispy/hard bits with it too. I had the chocolate ones. Molten choco inside...very tasty once I got past the heavy dough. Not airy, not pillowy, not what it should be.

When you can't help but to utter mmmm on every other bite - you know its good. Those are the best biscuits - flaky on the outside, fluffy in the middle and soaks up the butter. The grits were lumpy but still tasted nice and buttery. My cousin and I shared the apple cinnamon beignets which were fantastic.  The granola pancakes were also very good.  It was definitely worth the 45 minute wait.  mmmm the biscuits...

How effin wonderful this place is! Scrumptious, authentic meals at great portions, for under $10 a dish.   I took my boyfriend here on a Friday afternoon to start his birthday off early.  He moved to SF a few months ago (a southern boy)  and although the city offers so many fantastic eateries, he misses southern food.  Boy, was he fired up when he took a look at the menu outside of the restaurant. "Fried oyster po'boy ... whaaaaat" "Gumbo, oh man, we'll see..." "You can sample all the beignets!" You can imagine my delight, and relief, upon first bite of our food, that my bf had finally satisfied his soulfood craving. We started with a flight of beignets.  My fave was the crawfish: melt-in-ya-mouf cheesy, oozing with chunky bites of crawfish and a hint of cayenne.  The chocolate, we decided, would be smart to save for after our meal.  Great idea!  The apple and unfilled beignets were also inhaled. My sauteed shrimp and cheddar grits suprisingly have made its way to my favorites.  It didn't skimp on flavor and was just the perfect texture and creaminess. Sampling my bf's cup of gumbo, he matter-of-factly states, "The roux is the key to gumbo. You burn it, you might as well throw it all out."  I loved it, but did he?  I'm sure no one's gumbo compares to mom's or even his 'memaw'". I looked at him expectedly, and he utters, "OMG, it's soooo good." Whew.  I mean, ya damn right! We devoured the jambalaya, cooled off with sweet watermelon tea and fought over the last bite of the chocolate beignet.   We'll be back on his next day off!

I absolutely love Brenda's.  Don't let the wait deter you, it's worth every darn minute (40 min) on average on a weekend.  Having spent a year carousing around the southeastern United States, I would say that Brenda's is spot on southern food.  If you're watching your diet, don't even bother coming here. With their smooth buttery grits, 4 different typed of beignets (love the crawfish and cheese!), and down home southern breakfasts (try the hangtown scramble with bacon and fried oysters...yes fried oysters), I dare anyone to find a better breakfast in San Francisco. The quaint bistro like decor is nice and the friendly and courteous staff gets people in and out as fast as they can. I double dare you to find a better breakfast in SF!

I would like to experience Brenda's for brunch on the weekend but I'm not that patient of a guy to wait in line for 45 minutes. I also wish they were open for dinner so I could have more time to enjoy this great restaurant. The last time I went it was for lunch with some friends. We had just about everything on the menu (it's not that large actually). I had the Oyster po-boy which was delicious with a side of cole slaw. Other folks in our group had The Burger, which was also wonderful. I had a small bite of it. Then there was the Croque Monsieur looking super rich and tasty. We also had the Watermelon Tea...the best.  Also don't forget to have the chocolate beignets. I would give Brenda's Five Stars but I don't want to get in that habit. Maybe after I have lunch there a couple of dozen times more, I'll do just that. Great food and comfortable place although it's quite small.

If you can't choose, go with the sampler that gives you the original, the one with apple filling, and the one with cayenne pepper/crawfish. The crawfish beignet was my favorite in particular(kind of intense though) but all were super delicious. The watermelon Iced tea is refreshing. The rice and bean with andouille sausage special is also very tasty. Be prepared to wait in line though, it's a TINY space.

Just got back from a lackluster experience at Brenda's. Brenda's was #1 on my bookmark list.  I had read the reviews, knew what I wanted to order and was ready to wait.  No problem! The wait was only 5 minutes which was fab and the service was just fine.   However, the food was VERY disappointing.  I was crushed knowing that I could have made better breakfast at home.  :-( Ordered the crawfish beignets, banana's foster french toast and some hash. The beignets were cooked very nicely.  The dough was fantastic.  But the inside tasted like they dumped a bucket of salt inside and the top of the beignet was slathered in cayenne.  All I could taste was cayenne and salt.  That's pretty ridiculous considering I should have been tasting the crawfish, scallions and cheddar that the menu was touting. The hash was bland and mushy and weird.  It seemed like they were relying on the paprika to make some flavors happen but it just fell short.  I'm a potato connoisseur and I really felt like the hash had no love put into it.  Oh well... The banana's foster french toast was fine.   Plenty of banana flavor and plenty of sweet.   I'm disappointed with my meal.  Maybe I hyped it up for myself too much.  I wish I could give more stars but I will not be going back.

AHHHHHHH I have never experience this so called "French Soul Food" (I don't know why they don't just call it New orleans style food cuz that's what it really is) but I really enjoyed my experience here. I took my mother here and it was both of our first times there--went on a wednesday morning so there was no wait (thank god). It's a tiny place so i can only imagine how long the wait would be during the peak hours. The waitress wasn't as pleasent as I expected, but warmed up to us cuz we are just so damn friendly. Definitely come hungry, or make sure you have someone to share with! Portions are large. Here's the breakdown: -We ordered the Beignet sampler since it was our first time--might as well sample it all... It came with original, chocolate, apple cinnamon, and Crawfish.. heard good reviews about the crawfish one... maybe i'm not a crawfish fan but it was a little too salty/spicy for my liking. When i come back, i'll definitely stick with the plain Beignet--It's the winner -Pancakes--I'm a pancake fanatic and a bit of a snob so i'm picky but these were pretty good. My one pancake (i ordered a half order) was HUUUUUGE and the batter was super thick--not in a gross way, but a hearty/fill you up way. Definitely had some leftover for the next morning (which still tasted good btw) -My mother order some cheese, mushroom omelette that was also delicious. -Watermelon Ice Tea--GOOD! i'd never even heard of watermelon iced tea but it was worth it Anyways, moral of the story:  My mother loved it, the food is great, service is mediocre but i won't complain cuz the food came out fast and deliciou and the location is a little sketch but just use your street head and it's all good

I'm probably going to get shot for not giving this place a 5 star review.  But maybe everyone hyped this place up so much that I was expecting WAY more than what I got.  And that's kinda sad. BF and I showed up a little bit before they opened on a Saturday morning, to find we weren't the first people there.  Ok, that's a good sign.  So we put our name on the little sign in sheet and patiently wait.   When they finally opened, they sat everyone fairly quickly.  Brownie point.  I wasn't too sure what I would order since nothing on the menu particularly stuck out to me, but we decided on one of their specials for the BF and gumbo and beignets.  Quite honestly I thought the beignets were garbage.  Tough and chewy.  No bueno!  I enjoyed the watermelon tea, that was really good.  I wasn't all that impressed with the gumbo and gave up on it after a few bites.  BF was happy with his dish but it was that forgettable that I can't even remember what it was called. I'm willing to give the place another try.  I probably just ordered stuff that's not one of their best dishes.  But I won't be making the extra effort to come out and try it again.

Finally tried Brenda's on Sunday around 2 p.m. and we waited about 30-40 minutes for a table for 2.  It was worth the wait. We both had the watermelon iced tea and it's excellent.  Not too sweet but refreshing and yummy. Gumbo:  Delish!  The perfect amount of spice for me and the sausage was good quality.  My boyfriend is Creole and grew up on this stuff, he said it was good. Flight of beignets:  Very good.  The crawfish one was great and the plain one was fresh and light.  The chocolate one and the apple ones were a nice twist.  I liked the sweet with the spiciness of the other dishes. Fried catfish eggs benedict:  Boyfriend loved this!  I had a few bites and it was very good. Grits:  Tasty!  Worth getting! Hash:  Some of the yummiest potatoes in town!

So thrilled that I finally got to try this place out! I walk by it almost everyday and the lines are always crazy. (It's not that I won't wait in line, it's just that I prefer to send my time eating.) Anyhow, walking by at 2:50pm, not planning on eating at Brenda's, we carpe' diemed the heck out of the moment and snagged the last seating of the day. Yessssssssssssss. My lover and I split the crawfish beignet which was good, but rich. A lovely, cheesey, gooey, creamy crawfish center in the middle of a donut. God bless. The beignets are pretty dense and heavy. I think if I threw one through the window, it would probably break. I was full after my first one and I couldn't imagine getting another one down the hatch and having room for anything else. We then split a fried oyster po' boy. And, I'm going to put it out there - it was the best po' boy I ever had. Perfect, fresh and hearty bread. (Which we all know is a make or break for any kind of legit sammie.) Smokey, spicy remoulade. Big, juicy, meaty oysters delicately fried in cornmeal....oh man, it was heaven. I love the interior. It's small and cozy with an air of Na'leans - a swanky and mysterious attitude of sorts. Looking forward to visiting again. Next time, I plan on conquering some grits, watermelon iced tea, and beautiful french toast.

My favorites: the crawfish beignet, the oyster/bacon scramble, the eggs benedict, and the biscuits.  We tried the flight of beignets and while good, I've had better.  These were a little too "heavy".  Not dense, but not as light and fluffy, melt in your mouth, as I've had them.  However, I did love the flavors in the crawfish one.  The sweet ones I didn't care for.  I love oysters so naturally I loved the scramble which had a heavy oyster flavor.  Not good for everyone, but for me it was great.  There were also little tasty fried bits in the scramble.  The eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was delicious and thick.  We ordered it with the molasses ham, and while it was good, I prefer no sweetness with my eggs benedict.  The biscuits were fantastic with the perfect texture.  I didn't need to add butter.   What I didn't like: the veggie omelette (bland and too much liquid), the hash (also bland and too much liquid), and the grits (but I never like grits).   The portions were huge.  Our table of 4 shared 3 entrees and the flight of beignets.  We were stuffed, but still had a whole serving of hash left and most of the grits.

I struggled with the 4 vs. 5 stars on this one.  Going with 4 pending a return visit. I think the entire restaurant is about 10 square feet.  And I sat nearly pressed back-to-back with the large gentleman at the counter behind our table. But the food was glorious.  Heavenly even.  I got the beignet flight as my main dish.  The portions are large so I don't know how people can do a starter and a main.  I had to share mine since it was so much food but it was damn hard watching other people eat my delicious food.

I so LOVE Brenda! Even though she makes me wait for at least a half hour with every visit to chow down! Something my hypoglycemic a$$ can't handle sometimes but she makes it all worth it!!! It's a very small restaurant which is one of the reasons for the long wait, that and plus she's awesome! The kitchen is a sight to see, it's so tiny and you've only got one and half person there cooking but they're so quick to get the orders out. Here are the reasons why I love her so... Watermelon iced tea - this tea is so yummy! I can't get enough of it. Who knew, you could just stick a watermelon into an iced tea and heaven is that much closer! Grits - I never liked grits until Brenda introduced me to it. Whoa Nelly--where have you been all my life? Grits are creamy and oh so good. Catfish eggs benedict - My mouth waters just typing the damn thing. Geez! Shrimp po' boy - it's killer! Such a good taste to it. Beignets flights - you get a sampling of the plain, apple, chocolate, and the crawfish. The crawfish is the best--yeah it's a donut hole with crawfish, what's your point? It's still some mouth watering goodness!

Not worth the over 1 hour wait outside (in the cold, no benches/seats to sit on). I had the grillades dish for breakfast (didn't finish it, and I ALWAYS finish my food). Bisquits and gravy were good, but not as good as Pork Store's. Coffee was good though. My advice: Call in and order the beignets for pick up, along with a cup of coffee. That alone would warrant 4 stars.

I love beignets, I love chocolates, but I love dark chocolates more, and I love crawfish. I was still sound asleep when sister snuck over to Brenda's to pick up two crawfish and two chocolate beignets prior to our drive to Napa. Although the crawfish beignet was a bit on the greasy side, it had a kick from the cayenne which I liked.  I loved the chocolate beignets. We went wine tasting and biked through Napa and I hope we burned off the beignets.  I am missing them right now. I enjoyed dining in San Francisco very much and wish I could return for a visit soon...I've made stuffed dark chocolate beignets before and they were sooo good.  I wonder if I can figure out a crawfish recipe.  Hmm...

I came here for brunch on a weekday and luckily didn't have to wait too long.  Had the eggs and bacon tartine with grits, beignet flight, and watermelon iced tea.  I've never really had grits before except maybe once, I'm not even sure, but I decided to try it here since it's supposed to be good.  Well, I didn't like it.  At all.  It was just tasteless mush.  So now I know for sure that I am just not a grits person.  The eggs and bacon tartine was just okay to me, nothing special.  The beignets were okay as well, I thought they were a little too hard and there was a little too much dough for my liking.  It left me craving for more filling.  The watermelon iced tea was nice and refreshing.   I'd come here again to try some other stuff just because it's not your typical American brunch place, but I wouldn't wait that long for it.

I was very excited about Brenda's especially after reading all the Yelp reviews.  I figured the massive wait also had to say something about the food.  I went for brunch, party of two, wait was about an hour and I think the wait could have been longer but the weather was rainy and cold. The place is small probably about 25-30 seats (that helps explain the massive wait). The food is good but I'm not sure if it's worth the 1hr wait. Order: Chicory coffee Watermelon sweet tea Beignet Flight Eggs Benedict with Fried Catfish Grillades and Grits w/ biscuit The biscuits were very good, flaky and buttery.  The grits, awesome.  My poached eggs were overdone and my beef cutlets in creole gravy were a bit greasy. I definitely appreciate that the food comes out fresh and hot. The beignets were a bit heavy and bready for me.  I recall beignets from Cafe du Monde in New Orleands and those were light and fluffy (the best ever, i think I ate them everyday for breakfast when I was there). My boyfriend looked over at me while we were sampling the beignets and he said "You look so underwhelmed." Overall the food is good but quite heavy.  I'm happy I got to try it.

SF Big Eat #42 accomplished! This place is a true gem...tiny little closed door at the street corner hides in the aromatic and flavorful southern flair. Must try: sweet watermelon ice tea, beignets, shrimp poboy sandwich Having lived in Louisiana 6 years ago, I've always try to rediscover that flavor that I missed.....my host mother's southern home cooking. You feel the southern warmth and hospitality once you walk in, just by its name! It's like, hits your heart automaticlly.... Service was spectacular, the waitress comes by every now and then to refill your coffee or ice tea and asks if the food's okay. Definitely get the beignet flight (4 different flavors) if you can't decide whether you want sweet or savory flavor (because you won't be able to, they're all so good!!!) I wouldn't say they are as good as cafe du monde, but it gave me a good fix with an updated stuffed version. The fried shimp poboy sandwich was so delicious as well :) comes with a generous amount of either cole slaw or fries. The bread was perfectly toasted and the shrimps deeply fried to perfection. The sweet tea was made with watermelon juice and was so sweet and refreshing! Tip: try to come for lunch before 12:30 to avoid long waiting!

Brenda's is definitely one of my favorite brunch restaurants. Yes, the wait is long & I've only ever gotten seated at the counter, but it is completely worth it!! I'll have to say that my first visit was just so-so, we tried the egg and bacon tartine & the hangtown fry. I actually really disliked the egg and bacon tartine -- it was pretty plain, so I was content chowing down on the hangtown fry, which the restaurant did not skimp on! We also had the beignet sampler plate & easily found a favorite in the crawfish beignet. The others were also good, although the chocolate one was maybe just a bit too rich. On my next visit -- we were able to try a bunch of dishes, but holy mother of God!! The shrimp and grits w/ tomato&bacon relish blew me away. It may be one of the best brunch dishes I've had in San Francisco thus far! The grits were perfect w/ the shrimp & OMG, that relish is the bomb. The eggs benedict w/ catfish & biscuit were also delicious, but again, maybe just a bit too heavy. I do foresee a bunch of repeat visits to Brenda's in the future -- & omg, they do take-out?? IM DOWN.

I recommend the watermelon iced tea Crawfish beignets is also worth a try What's the hype? I don't get it. I love brunch! I'm the type of person who wake up at 8 in the morning to line up in front of Mama's or Dottie's while still wearing a thick grandma's sweater and half-opened, half-shut eyes. For Brenda's, I don't want to even consider going there on weekend. The waiting time is crazy and waiting is okay if the food is great but problem is... it isn't. So why should I waste my time? Here's my little story: I waited for more than an hour but then, I left for a while to meet someone at Japantown. Turned out when I came back, my name had been called. I was skipped by two people. So I put my name on the list again, waiting in the chilly San Francisco's weather: bored and needed to go to toilet so bad.... After an hour (so total 2 1/2 hrs of wait), I got seated and ordered anything that yelpers recommended (beignets, grits, watermelon iced tea) and was kinda upset about it since it really didn't worth my wait. I didn't finished my food and that happened only once in a blue moon! I didn't even care to get a to-go box. I'll stick with Mama's or Dottie's next time.

Goooood food but not 1-hr-wait-with-a-price-tag good. Now, your wait might be more like 35+ minutes realistically...it's just that we got skipped after moseying over to Philz for some dranks (our bad). The place is way tiny, and our party of 3 were squished by the door on one small table. The service is minimal, and it was hard to see past the scowls on most of the staff's faces. But the real draw is the food, and it was good. Andouille omelette - tasty, wish it was bigger though. The potato hash, tasty & standard. Grillades & grits - meh. Was expecting yumminess from searching the Yelp reviews, but the meat wasn't fantastic and the gravy tasted like a slightly spicy Bolognese sauce. Crawfish pot pie seemed like a good choice. BEIGNET FLIGHT... bloop. Overall they seemed overly dry and just-okay. Granny smith's filling was dry, might as well get the McD's apple pie. Choco...good, but can't go wrong with chocolate. Crawfish...innovative, tasty, but not phenomenal. I must say the biscuits were heavenly though. Flaky, soft, buttery...the best biscuit I've ever had. All in all, good, but don't wait forever and expect to be wowed. I'd come back to see how good the po' boys are!

I waited 1.5 hours for our seats at the counter and it was totally worth it. The beignets were delicious, especially the crawfish one (who knew spicy/salty beignets were a thing), and the neverending watermelon sweet tea really hit the spot after 90 minutes of chilling outside. I got a fried catfish po'boy with fries -- paired with Crystal hot sauce, it was a dream come true in my mouth. A Dream. Come. True. The Boy got the Hang Town fry (fried oysters, bacon + scrambled eggs, grits, and a biscuit) and our other two friends got the eggs benedict. Everyone loved their dishes and we left very satiated. Can't wait to come back and wait again for delicious food (I mean that without the usual sarcasm that accompanies statements like that. I genuinely loved the food here)!

Small place with really nice service.  Good for 2-4 people.  Went on a weekday so there was no line but I heard this place is usually packed. Ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine plus Beignet Flight.  Really good job on the toasted French roll and the bacon.  Eggs needed a lil tabasco sauce.  Of the beignet, the crawfish topped my list.  The chocolate and the  apple beignet felt more like a dessert than a breakfast.  Their Café au Lait was not superb but went really nice with the food. The biscuits smell really good.  Dude at the next table said the biscuits are a must try at this place.  So I will definitely be heading back for some biscuit soon. Parking is not a big problem on the wkdays as long as you bring some change with you to feed the street meters.

Meehhhh. Very overrated. This reminds of the type of place that elitist latte liberals like to rave about and make excuses for, even when they are being served mediocre food. Had the beignets, every flavor. Unlike the authentic beignets from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans which are light and fluffy, these are big, heavy, dry and very hard. They were not a pleasure to eat at all. The shrimp and grits was good, it was the best thing about the meal. The Croque Monsieur was OK, it was not mind blowing. It was OK. I understand this place is French and it's quaint, but other than that, the food is just OK, it's not fabulous. The beignets are horrible. Had much better.

I'll keep this short and sweet unlike the line that I had to wait in to get a table. 1. I'm not sure what the big deal was but my breakfast was average. Nothing was outstanding. 2. I like the different flavored beignets but the execution was average. They were on the heavy, dense side - not delicate and fluffy at all. 3. I don't see a reason for coming back. I don't care for all the hype over this place.

This was surely a 5-star experience. The food was magnificiant.  Of course, french soul food is a type of cuisine you normally don't have, so this was a real treat!   The location isn't that great, but of course could be worse. It's in the tenderloin/civic center area, right across the street from the Culinary Academy.   We waited about 20 mins. for Sunday Brunch.  Tiny restaurant and could watch Brenda herself cook our omelette!!  It was so cool to observe her and how cool, calm and collected she was.   We started off with the beignet flight, which is a sampling of 4 beignets - apple, cinnamon filled, chocolate filled, plain and crawfish with cayenne pepper on the outside.  They were all wonderful!  We vote that the crawfish and chocolate win.  We also split the creole veggie omelette and it was delicious.  It was well seasoned, the egg was fluffy and light - this is how an omelette should be done.  The veggies were slightly crunchy - perfect.  We got ours with a biscuit and potato hash.  Just thinking of that biscuit is making my mouth water.  It was amazing.  It was no KFC biscuit.  I swear, the rest of the day I could taste that biscuit on my tongue.  The potato hash was unique and tasty.   Highly recommend this place.  Brenda knows how to cook.  The servers are quick and efficient - perfect spot for groups of 1-4 only.

Okay after all this hype from Yelp as well as from friends, i came here with the girls for a saturday brunch. And really, the only thing that I can really say stood out was the Crawfish Beignets and the Watermelon Sweet Tea, and thats pushing it. The rest of the food was good, but as with most breakfast places, its nothing you can't make yourself. I would come back, but I really don't think its worth the wait. Maybe if they gave out Watermelon Sweet Tea while you waited. :)

If there is one thing that I hate, it's waiting forever for a table... however, I find myself pumping $5 of change in the meter, checking the waitlist as if anything really changed since the last time I checked 2 minutes ago, and freeze my ass off for a good 45-60 minutes until my table gets called... and I keep doing this because it's all worth it. If you never had Brenda's, go on a off day if you can so you won't get turned off by the wait or just call in an order. Here are the dishes I have tried and love... - WATERMELON ICED TEA (if I'm not sipping on coffee then I'm sipping on this) - BEIGNETS (samplers are good to share but  the crawfish is king!) - GUMBO (the question isn't if I should get it or not... it's "cup or bowl?") - PO BOY'S (catfish, shrimp, or oyster... they're all incredible) - SHRIMP AND GRITS (buterrrrrrrrrry!) - BENEDICT (it's been awhile but I remember it being good) - SWEETS (I'm a savory breakfast guy for sure... with that said, their peach cobbler, strawberry cobbler, and fuji apple pancakes were on hit... as well as banana foster french toast) - CORNED BEEF AND HASH (Brenda... please bring it back!!!!!!)

Get the crab beignets.  Very tasty.  I didn't really care for the other beignets. The biscuit - good but heavy THe shrimp & goat cheese omelet with potatos - great THe wait is atrocious.  We decided to order to go since the wait would have been an hr or more.

Beignets ftw! Crawfish has cayenne not just sprinkled on top, open up the whole bottle on it. A little too much dough but the get to the seafood and these are great! I didn't really like my Sloppy Josephine (a turkey version of a sloppy joe). Special "pumpkin pie pancakes" were delicious! But maybe they don't offer them everyday.

Decided to try this place out for brunch and before catching a matinee flick at AMC down the street which had me a little leery since it was a tenderloin, don't get me wrong, I love food in the 'Loin, I just don't expect it to be anything fancy. I spotted the place as we walked towards it, it wasn't hard since it stood out with nearly 2 dozen people standing outside the entrance on a Saturday morning, some of them sipping coffee out of large ceramic mugs. As we got close I noticed the clipboard/wait list hanging outside the front door and that we were about the 9th or so party down the list. Luckily it wasn't raining or really cold. After about 30+ minutes and a couple of M.I.A. Parties we were offered a seat at the bar facing a mirror running the length of the wall which also had the days specials on it. The server gave us our menus and a rundown of the specials, then brought me my coffee. DUDE, they serve community coffee! It's decent coffee, I was just more impressed that the company was still in business. Anyways, I decided to go with the french toast but skipped on the buttery toasted pecan sauce (maybe I'll try it next time). Turn around time was pretty quick. Our orders were taken a few minutes after being seated and the food was brought out about 10 minutes after that. The french toast was a pretty healthy serving, sure it was only 3 slices but they were big slices, normally I'd be pretty upset that there wasn't any breakfast meat with it but after taking the first bite I was all good, everything tasted fresh (read: not from frozen). That honestly was some good French Toast, most places I goto really skimp on the cinnamon but not this place, it was pretty fricken tasty. Eating my meal I eyeballed the restaurant, it's not the tiniest place I've been too but it's up there, I don't think there was more than 12 tables, none of which could seat more than 4 people but the place does have a really nice setting which once again throws me off figuring it's location. We finished up our meals, the server was really prompt on seeing that we were done and getting us our bill (a bonus figuring we had to get to the movies) and we were on our merry way. The place has some really good food, I don't think any of us were disappointed by what we had and I'll definitely will be coming back to this place in the future whenever I'm in the neighborhood for brunch.

I've tried the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette and the Sloppy Josephine. So good! Line can get pretty hectic on certain mornings, but I think the extension of the restaurant should be up and running in the near future. More seats! Holllla. Overall, worth the wait.

Let me start this review first by admitting that it is quite possible the 2 star experience we had with this yelp rated 5 star restaurant is our own doing; we had Turtle Tower's chicken pho before sitting down at Brenda's. My friend was visiting SF for the first time, and he came armed with a list of restaurants to try.  Brenda's French Soul Food was THE ultimate place for him.   After much anticipation, planning and traveling, we finally made it to Brenda's this past rainy Sunday, the last day of his visit. While still 0.5 block away, we saw the groups of people standing outside Brenda's.  Put our name on the list and was informed that it'd be a 45 min to an hour wait.  Since he is visiting and we have a tight schedule, we came up with the genius idea of jetting to Turtle Tower for some pho as an appetizer and come back to Brenda's for the main course.   We waited for 10 minutes at Turtle Tower, sat, ordered, ate and was done in 30 minute, made it back to Brenda's to only wait another 30 minutes.  So the total wait time was approximately an hour and 15 minutes.   After we sat down, my friend and I proceed to order the following: Craw fish Beignet Andouille & cheddar omelet Banana Foster French Toast Watermelon Ice Tea Watermelon ice tea arrived in a snap, took a sip and have to say it is nothing special.  Yes, it is very refreshing, it is also very sweet.  It tasted to me like any other fresh watermelon juice you can get in any Asian bubble/drinks shop but of course the tea came with lots of sugar in it.  I generally request my water melon juice w/ little or no sugar.   The craw fish beignet arrived next.  Each order of the beignets came with 3 beignets.  Silly us to thought each order is ONE beignet, yes I started to sweat with the idea of finishing all the food we ordered.  (i don't like to waste food.) We shared one beignet, and decided to take the other two home. The craw fish beignet was my last choice of beignets to order.  As I had the traditional beignet in New Orleans before and I know it is served as a sweet breakfast item, I was still adjusting to the idea of a stuffed beignet let alone a salty stuffed beignet.   The dough part of the beignet was good.  It was crispy outside, with a moist but chewy consistency, which is how I like my beignets.  The craw fish filling to me was nothing special.  I was wary of all the cayenne pepper or whatever red powdery thing it had coated on the outside, as I generally choke on those while inhaling my food.   Then the omelet and the french toasts arrived. I had the french toast.  The french toast was good.  I had wanted something sweet as a dessert following the chicken pho.  The french toast eaten in a forkful with the banana rum sauce, whipped butter and sliced banana was a mouthful of different tastes and textures and yet it all came together really well.  The warmth and doughiness of the toast was offset with the coolness of the sliced banana.  The sweetness of the butter rum sauce was complemented by the whipped butter and the natural sweetness of banana.  All in all, I liked and enjoyed my french toast. The Andouille & cheddar omelet came with potatoes, a biscuit and a side of plain grits.  I didn't try the potatoes so can't comment on it.  I am not a biscuit person and so didn't enjoy the biscuit, although my friend said of all the food he liked the biscuit the best.  The grits were like drinking butter soup.  It was so very buttery, I can feel my blood vessels being coated with butter.  And I am a butter everything gal.  The omelet was okay as well.  The andouille is really salty, but then it generally is.  So I think its just my personal preference.   We couldn't finish everything so had to box 60% of our food to go.  My friend looked like he was about to pass out from all the food we had ate.  It literally aged him by like 3 years. I am not sure if our experience would have been different if we didn't have the pho.  While sharing a large chicken pho didn't fill us up, it did ruined us for Brenda's extremely rich and heavy french soul food menu.  On the same token, I do not associate rich, creamy and heavy food with breakfast/brunch/lunch.  So I wonder would I really enjoy Brenda's soul food on an empty stomach? In a nut shell, I had to give this place 2 stars.  While the food wasn't terrible and I did enjoy my french toasts, I didn't feel that it was anything special or worth the wait. Check my friend's review on Brenda's here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… He gave them a 5 star rating!

Yes, there will be a line...so if it's cold or raining, you better time your arrival right! I tried the beignet sampler and shrimp/goat cheese omelett.  My favorite is the chocolate and crawfish beignet.  so yummy.  I forced myself to finish the not very awesome omelett so I can save my two favorites for later.   It seems like they are making the place bigger...definitely good news because I would like to return to try the shrimp and grits!

This was my first experience here. I picked up Big Daddy from work and we had an hour or so before I had work so we decided to go have some breakfast. We usually like to yelp what's close by and eat something exciting and different. After reading others' reviews, I'm glad I came on a weekday morning because there was no wait at all. We got seated immediately. The place is cute and small, but i really don't like how close the tables and seats were where you can hear other ppls conversations even if you were whispering. Big Daddy got the Shrimp & Grits. Which came with a decent amount of shrimp and the taste was fantastic, once you eat one shrimp, you can't stop. The grits was flavorful, cheesy and non grainy. I make grits at home and it can never taste like this LOL I ordered the Cheddar & Sausage Omelette. It came with potatoes and a decent sized biscuit. On top of the omelette was a salsa flavor topping. It went well with the omelette. Inside the omelette was mushrooms, cheddar cheese and sausages. I normally like spicy sausages, but it was ok with this omelette. The biscuit was fluffy and flaky. Just how I liked it. Before the waitress walked away, Big Daddy had to order the crawfish beignets. I'm so glad he did. I love seafood and esp crawfish. It looked like big puffs of donuts sprinkled with red power but I believe it was chili powder. Each order came with 3. We shared only one because I wanted to eat my breakfast. Took the other 2 home to enjoy later on for a snack. Biting into the crawfish beignet was delightful. Outside was semi crispy and the inside was droolingly soft and as I took my first bite and looked what was inside, you see crawfish and cheese and feel an explosion of flavors in your mouth LOL. All in all the experience was amazingly delightful. I would probably go again and try something new...

I came here on a rainy Friday to check out Brenda's. Thinking that I was going to wait over an hour to get a table, my friends and I only waited about 10 minutes.  I guess it's a good thing to come here when it's raining. No wait no lines. Woo hoo!! We ordered: Beignet flight: Plain, Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple and Craw fish Shrimp and Grits Egg & Bacon Tartine Watermelon Iced tea Everything was delicious! The watermelon iced tea was so refreshing.   It is one of the best iced teas I've had.  The egg and Bacon Tartine was just ok.  The Craw fish beignet and the shrimp and grits were my fave! I'm so glad we decided to get the flight so that we could try all the beignets.  All the beignets were good, but the craw fish one stood out the most.   The waiter suggested shrimp and grits.  We were a bit hesitant to try it because none of us were sure if we liked grits, but these grits were AMAZING. The dish was smothered in cheese, bacon, and shrimp! It was a bit heavy though, luckily I was sharing with my friends.   I would definitely come back and try the Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict.  We didn't get to try it because it is only offered during weekends.  I also want to try the Fried Shrimp Po Boy, I didn't realize that it was on the 7x7 list.

What is there to say that hasn't already been said by least seventeen hundred and ninty-nine other human beans (making me the 1800th!)? Probably nothing, so I won't even try to not be repetitive. Eat the ben-YAY!!s, especially the crawfish one. That one is money in your jackpots. I've only been here once so far (I know, major lag), but everything put down on our table was pretty good. Tried the watermelon tea. It was tea with watermelon. It didn't spaz my mind out, but it was refreshing. Small space, lengthy wait, lots of chalk dust, happy stomach.

FINALLY I got to eat here! Yeah, the hour wait totally sucks, but if you're in good company then it should be fine! :) The main library and City Hall are just down the street, so if you really want to, go inside the library and browse for books, or in the case of City Hall, gawk at the awesome ceiling in the main lobby! OR Brenda's also posts their menu outside, so you can spend some time looking things over and deciding what you want! There's a word list posted next to the menu, so I got a little vocabulary/pronunciation lesson too (beignet = BEN-yay, maque choux = mock shoe). I decided to get the beignet flight (a sampling of all 4 of the different kinds of beignets: plain, chocolate, granny smith apple, and crawfish) and the creole veggie omelet! It was great because the egg dishes come with your choice of hash/grits and toast/biscuit, so you don't have to get a side of it, which is what I was initially thinking of doing. I opted for the grits and biscuit, both of which were yummy yummy in my tummy! Hmmm that biscuit...so light and fluffy and warm...! The beignets were delicious too! My favorite was the chocolate and the crawfish! I wouldn't bother with the plain because there's nothing inside! Unless you like plain donuts... Both my friends got gumbo...also highly recommended! It's a small place, so you'll probably end up sitting right next to a stranger, but it's clean and the staff is friendly and work very quickly and efficiently! Yeah! :) Since it's in the Tenderloin, you can get some sketchy characters coming up to you asking for money or cigarettes, but since Brenda's isn't open at night and there's usually a lot of people waiting to be seated, it's really not scary at all. Will be back for more! Great southern eating! It's definitely worth the wait!

Must be the best place I ever ate at! seriously amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Have not had once mediocre or ok thing here of all the times I ate her! When i stand shivering and drooling in the cold waiting for a seat, people often stroll by curiously looking at the menu. They usually ask me "Is this place good? Is it worth it?" and I enthusiastically say  "HELL YEAH!!!!!" Just order of the specials menu. My favorite thing hands down so far was the fried oyster scramble (cant remember the name, but can remember the taste!)

With 1,800+ reviews and counting, there probably isn't much new I can say here. Before I went to San Fransisco, I asked all my friends where we should eat and this place was on everyone's top five (usually at number one) so we made a point of going here. The line is well worth the wait... We started out with the biegnet flight...crayfish, chocolate, plain and apple cinnamon. All delicious. I had the fried chicken eggs benedict and it was absolutely fantastic. I recommend this restaurant to anyone going to SF on a food vacation.

Really long lines for lunch.  We got there at 11:45am but had to wait for over an hour before we got seated.  I recommend coming here for a late lunch instead.  Lines are much shorter at 2pm. We tried the beignet flight, which weren't bad. I would probably only get the chocolate one if we ever got them again. The other ones were meh. I got the BFC thigh which was piping hot and super moist when it came to the table. Only problem was that it lacked flavor.  I'm not sure but it seems like the fried chicken that you can get with the salad looks more seasoned than the fried chicken by itself. Overall, not a bad place to go for brunch or late lunch.

Get there by 9 or be prepared to wait in line for a table! We started with the flight of beignets -- husband plowed through the savory crawfish by himself, I ate half the apple one and we packed the chocolate and plain to go so we'd have room for the real brunch. Highly recommend it if you've never tried their food or can't decide which flavor beignets to get. I ordered the french toast sans the butter pecan sauce because I thought it would be too rich after the half apple beignet I just swallowed. It wasn't the best french toast I've had, but I still cleaned my plate. Husband ordered the fried catfish eggs benedict. He said he didn't need a knife for it so it went from plate to stomach pretty fast. I take it he liked it. A lot. What I kept seeing people order was the egg and bacon tartine. Tables to the left and right had them with the cheesy grits and it made me jealous! I think I'll have to get that next time.

Okay, now there are three things I will keep coming back for. The already established two were the beignets and the biscuits. Third, the bananas foster french toast. Fricking amazing. Other than that, as the ratings go, everything else is A-ok, no complaints...though we did have to flag people down for more coffee with a less than half full dining room.

tried their crawfish beignet, they were enormous and toothsome. the gumbo was delicious and a Lousiana native friend said that it was authentic and perfect! Fried Chechen: nicely prepared and loved up to expectations but nothing too spectacular. Cheese and shrimp grits was really cheesy, they were very good but we wished they had toned it down a notch the cheesiness. also watermelon iced tea was a very nice treat :)

This place was amazing! Definitely a place that I would go to again to make sure I try everything on the menu. We ordered the Beignet Flight (sampler), Hangtown Fry, and the Shrimp&Grits. And of course we had to try the Watermelon Iced Tea. I'm really glad I ordered the Beignet Flight Sampler. I was surprised on how big the portions were. You can never go wrong with a Plain Beignet. The Ghirardelli Beignet was good too, but a little too much chocolate in my opinion. The apple beignet was delicious, just wish the apples inside were alittle softer. Lastly, the crawfish beignet was AMAZING! It had just the right amount of spice to it. Hangtown Fry was delicious. You can either have a choice of grits or hash on the side, I'm glad I ordered the hash.. it was delicious! Shrimp&Grits was surprisingly AMAZING. I'm not really a big fan of Grits but it was just absolutely amazing. Definitely give this dish 5 stars. Lastly, we just had to try their famous watermelon iced tea to see what all the rage was all about. It was good, standard iced tea. This place is overall amazing! Definitely a spot you HAVE to try at least once.

After a 90 min wait, dry as hell fried chicken, uninspired Beneits and service that was quite bad this restaurant is getting a much deserved reality check. Also in case you are unaware this restaurant is located on skid row. A truly horrible neighborhood where if you are brae enough to walk it you will be hurdling human feces to get to the restaurant.

The food and service are a 5 but we had to wait an hour (at 10 in the morning) to eat.  They are going through an expansion right now so they should soon have a lot more room but the more than one hour wait just killed me. The FOOD is amazing here, I wanted to try everything on the menu but we went with the crawfish beignets and the fried chicken eggs benedict.  They have this amazing cajun hollandaise which is simply to die for, I only wish there was more of it on the plate as the eggs benedict got a little dry after a couple of bites.  The crawfish beignets were yummy, but a little more doughy than I would like.  But the filling more than made up for it. I loved the food here and will definitely come back if I am ever in the city!

On my 30th birthday, my Southern-born partner (god bless his heart) surprised me with a trip to New Orleans. There he introduced me to the magic of seafood gumbo, crawfish étouffée, BBQ shrimp, and grilled oysters among other culinary delights New Orleans has to offer.  Upon coming back I had a hankering for Creole/Cajun food like no other, but was sad to find the city was severely lacking in authentic Creole food... that is until I stumbled across Brendas (*ok so I actually read about it in Travel + Leisure magazine's Top 50 New Restaurants issue, but that's not the point).   The point is this: Brendas serves authentic--scratch that--AMAZING New Orleans style soul food and I've been a major fan ever since I first tasted her gumbo one rainy Sunday brunch (which we waited an hour for outside just to get in!). And to find out that they now serve DINNER in their new expanded dining room -- we were beyond thrilled. We actually rushed out to eat dinner there the first day we realized and I have to say per usual her gumbo was... da bomb. Not a gumbo "soup" or that watery stuff you'd find elsewhere -- this was thick, luscious, savory ambrosia of the gods.  So good, I order it EVERY TIME, no matter what else is on the menu. It just never fails to satisfy. We saw that she was now doing oysters and couldn't decide so we tried the oyster flight... ahhhhmazing (the two in the middle of the menu list -- the Saint Charles and the Tchoupitoulas were the best). Fried chicken was juicy and had great flavor but we were disappointed there was no leg portion (only breast, thigh and wing). The crunchy exterior also seemed fried really hard but the flavor was spot on. The cream biscuit out of this world with butter and homemade jam. The special of the night was BBQ pork rib with collard greens and mac and cheese (all of which was to die for). We arrived at 6 p.m. on Saturday and was shocked to find no line. This will not last. TRUST ME--once the rest of you yahoos catch on you'll all be lining up out the door. This place will knock your socks off.

Date/Time:  Saturday - 2:00pm Occasion:   Lunch time! Party of:  Two Ordered: Spicy crawfish beignets, Croque madame, and Crispy pork belly with cheddar grits + Watermelon iced tea. Total incl gratuity: ~$40 I have seen Brenda's on many SF must-eat lists.  Bear and I happened to be in the TL area one Saturday afternoon and decided to go for it.  The wait was rather lengthy and it's a pain because all nearby spots are metered parking.  I think we spent a total of $4.00 in quarters for the wait alone and another $3.50 for our actual meal so be ready with a bag of change if you plan to dine here. I am happy to say that Brenda's was worth the wait!  Firstly, the spicy crawfish beignets were A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!  Crispy and fried on the outside and ooozy, cheesy, and a bit of a kick on the inside.  When we ordered, we seriously thought it was gonna be one beignet for $7.95 so imagine our surprise when our order arrived with three beignets.  What a steal!  It really is as good as many yelpers say it is.  I ordered the special for the day: the pork belly cheddar grit.  I wasn't even quite sure what grits were so I was really in for a treat.  My entree arrived and it essentially looked like a chunk of pork belly marinating in a bowl of mashed potatoes covered in cheddar cheese.  It was really hearty and very good.  The pork belly was moist, the mundane taste of grits leveled out with the heaping of rich cheddar.  I really enjoyed my meal.  I wasn't a fan of the croque madame; a little too heavy on the bread. The place is really busy so the service is quick - getcha in, served, and out, but pleasantly.  I would definitely recommend this place for a unique brunch experience.  Although a heads up, you will definitely be full for most of the day.  Brenda's does not leave you hungry.

Went to Brenda's for the first time a few weeks ago and waited about an hour to get a seat... it was totally worth it.  Their sweet tea was refreshing, omelets were super tasty, and beignets were delicious (I must admit they aren't as great as Cafe Du Monde's beignets in New Orleans but they come in close as second)!  They give you huge portions and the food is flavored nicely.  I would definitely recommend this place.

The food here was truly delicious, NewOrleans style food , we went on a weekday morning so , no wait and we were seated and served right away, I only regret I was too full from the huge portions to try the beignets, which were calling to me. This is not a cuisine you find in NY , so  it was a treat.

I had to write a review to add it to my Love TL list. Brenda's is the best for lazy over-indulgent weekend brunch. Crawfish beignets, grits, po'boys, the make-your-own mimosas that you all new kids missed when they expanded and got a liquor license. It's safe to say brunch at Brenda's should be your main attraction for the day because afterwards you will be barely able to move.

Beignets are excellent.  Fruit plate was good as were the specials.  We will be back to try the shrimp po' boy.  The service was really good and I liked the atmosphere.   However, I love me a good biscuit and I had high hopes.  The biscuit was good - but it wasn't buttery. It was more shortening based, maybe? It just wasn't the kind of biscuit that I was hoping for - maybe I got a bad, non-buttered one or something? I saw Brenda in the kitchen and it seemed like a lot of customers knew her. I wanted to say hi and thank her for the beignets, but decided that was a bit awkward since she was cooking in the kitchen. We will be back. Hopefully for Mardi Gras? If they have a Mardi Gras party I want to go!

The thing about this place is the same thing I've found myself saying more and more in the last couple of months: the food is mediocre and overpriced, and I'm not that impressed, but I know I'll come back anyway.  I could drop the same amount of money at a restaurant with far better food and a far better menu, but there will still be days when I crave a burger from Brenda's.   Burgers are hard.  They're a timeless institution that begs for innovation and it's rare that I've found one that was tweaked enough to still be recognizable as that familiar cheeseburger.  Brenda's has led me to this conclusion: burgers, classically, have the most perfect elements, and to create something that is deserving of my awe wouldn't require much of a drastic change, just ingredients of Quality, in proper proportion, that I can both wolf down as well as enjoy.   Brenda's has given me this.   It's still a little pricey ($9? $11? I don't remember, something like that), but I love it anyway.  The tomatoes are ripe, the red onions are sliced thin, the lettuce is proportionate to the size of the patty (don't you hate it when the lettuce composes 50% of the mass between those buns?), and the bun isn't still and isn't too soft.  And it comes with Brenda's own homemade ketchup, which is so, so good.   Don't get me wrong, Brenda's isn't my favorite restaurant.  More often than not, my friends and I have received biscuits that were raw in the middle, breakfast dishes that were under-seasoned, and food that was overall not worth the wait. But it's something different from all the other restaurants that are around this area, something of finer quality, and something I can see only getting better as it's around longer (which you know it will be).   Brenda's? Sure I'll be back (especially for that burger), but I'll still miss Sun's Cafe that used to reside in the same spot.  Now let me tell you, they made a philly cheesesteak that was TO DIE FOR.

I really really want to love Brenda's. And I do, in certain ways. I love the cozy, wood-paneled, sunlit, busy room. The friendly wait staff. The fact that they set up a nice restaurant in a not-so-nice area. But after having been there 5 times I have to say that the brunch is not as good as I expect it to be given the prices and typical wait. The cafe au lait, the French toast, pancakes (regular and sweet potato), scrambled eggs, and omelettes (goat cheese/shrimp and Creole veggie) are so-so, the portions large but the taste unimpressive. What I do recommend though is getting there before the line forms at 10 am, sitting at the bar with your paper or novel and ordering a cup of   coffee and the delicious crawfish beignets or homemade biscuits. That's what keeps me coming back for more.

Brenda's French Soul Food was yummiclious!  I stopped in after reading great reviews of this place and wanted to confirm everyones yelps.   The food was prepared hot and was what I expected.  The one thing that really stood out to me was Brenda's biscuits.   It warm, flaky and had great texture.  Mix that in with some butter and preserves and you have a great biscuit!  The Grits was yummy and everything else was good. My only complaint was that this place was TINY.  I think I would have enjoyed my meal more if my elbow didn't hit the lady next to me every time I took a bite of my meal.   Oh another thing....I love how my waitress didn't wear a bra and had serious THO!!!  It all good  though cause it was a little chilly that morning!  =0)

I am a huge fan of breakfast and brunch!  It is my favorite meal of the day.  Perhaps because there are so many options for vegetarians.  Anyways, I went here this morning and I really enjoyed it.  It is really tiny place so be expected to wait outside for at least 30 minutes.  I felt like I was in someone's house getting a Sunday brunch after church!  The only down side is that the door would stay open for a little bit letting in a cool draft, but hey that's SF for ya.  I had the French Toast with Pecan syrup... delicious.  The hash was great as well.  The portions are rather large, but that seems to be the trend in our country! Great place to go for brunch and I will definitely come again!

If your in the mood for beignets, there really is only one place to go in the city.  Oh course, be prepared to go early, to head off the crowds or long wait.  Also, be prepared not to eat again until the end of the day... The crawfish beignets with cayenne, scallions and cheddar heavenly, especially when they are fresh and hot!  Oh and the Hometown Fry, a dish of oyster, bacon and egg scrambled is freakin' awesome!  Wash it down with a cup of Brenda's coffee and you are good to go for the rest of the day - seriously, for the rest of the day.

There are far better places to get a southern soul food kitchen breakfast, "It's For You" to start...at 21th St/3rd Street in Dogpatch.  Great food, great service, great atmosphere (great benet's and great grits).  And if you're in the neighborhood, go to Dottie's...**** and worth every minute of the wait! The coffee we ordered for the table...never came (and we had to ask to have it taken off the bill). The (apple filled) Benet's...ice hockey pucks My Yogurt/Granola parfait (for $6.50) horribly overpriced for cheap yogurt and a whole bunch of grapes. Grits - it was more polenta than it was grits...odd odd odd The biscuits....not so bad. It's just that there are so many other great breakfast places and honestly, "It's For You" has been doing it for so long, and their crab cakes and southern soul food and hot sauces and spicey sausages, etc...far far better. Won't be going back.

Beignets... good Biscuits... good Watermelon tea... good Hash... good This place is not for the health conscious or the claustrophobic (this place is tiny with you and your neighbors almost sitting on each others' laps) but it's a place I'm willing to walk around in the Tenderloin for. We shared the beignet flights and I had one of their brunch specials - oyster and bacon scramble with hash and a biscuit. The beignets were HUGE, we were able to split each one into 4 and we all got a good taste. The savory crawfish was my fave, but they were all pretty good. My scramble was good too, never had oysters in a scramble before. And the biscuit was nice and moist and flaky (they must use lard me thinks). Didn't really need the butter or jam, but it was a nice touch. Great place for some comfort food,southern style with no frills decor and good service.

Over a 2-hour wait! (the 2nd time); 1st time was an hour & 45 minutes. Beignets were pretty good. Some of the food was ok, some was "Eh". Nothing really jumped out at me as "WOW! I would love to eat that again." Definitely NOT worth the wait. I don't understand why this place always has such a long line when there are better restaurants in the area.

4.5 stars!  Which pertains to every single item below.  We arrived at 9 am on Easter Sunday and only waited about 20-30 minutes - but the line got very long about 10 minutes after we got there.  SO glad we got up early to eat here! Ordered the... Andouille (sp?) omelet - perfectly fluffy eggs - one of the best omelets I've had in a long time Apple cinnamon beignets - DELICIOUS Special - Eggs benedict on biscuits served with fried catfish - ummm, to die for Corned beef has - my BF's favorite meal - he loved it! Tea - they have nice big mugs so I feel like I can drink a lot of it.   Biscuits - some of the best I've had - perfectly flakey, buttery, and moist - I sure didn't need to any anything to them. Service was great - very attentive, but not overly so and it was all well worth the wait.  We are absolutely going back and bringing friends!

Brenda's is delicious! My bestie brought me here on a Sunday morning for some breakfast and did the waiting with out me so by the time I showed up our table was ready. After I had the meal I would have easily waited a half hour for that food. yummmmmyyyyyyy in my tummy. The menu is short, but manages to cover something for every taste bud and sticks to a Creole style which was awesome because it offers a unique take on a normal breakfast joint. I ordered the Creole Veggie Omelette made with egg whites and a side of grits. The eggs were cooked perfectly cooked and the girts were lip smacking good. One thing you should know is that this place is not afraid of the oil and butter, I could see the oil coming off around my eggs. This place is definitely an indulgence. Can't wait to go again and eat the beignets next time.

Two Words:  Flight of Beignets. When your restaurant is full at 11 am on a Wednesday, either your food is great or your restaurant is too small.  Both are true of Brenda's.  The only thing better than the Flight of Beignets (Crawfish Beignets?  Yeah, baby) was the Grillades and Grits.  Hoo-a.  I'm a happy dude.

Love love love it! The clipboard hanging by the door means you add yourself to the waiting list and stand on the sidewalk. What kind of freaks stand out on the sidewalk waiting to eat in a shoebox sized restaurant? Turns out - everybody. We had brunch and found the portions large and the beignets totally yummy. Can't wait to go again. The atmosphere is really really cramped - maybe 11 tables in the whole place and be prepared to be elbow to elbow with fellow diners. Servers are smart and speedy. The four guys in the kitchen churn out food as fast as they can. Run, don't walk. But don't show up starving!

I discovered this hole in the wall when it opened a few years ago and I was living within walking distance of the Tenderloin, which I affectionately call the TL. Some years later, returning to this once humble spot I find swarms of Yelpers lined up around the block waiting upwards of an hour for a tiny table inside. All recent hype aside, this place is still as excellent as I remember it on my first visit. Order: a flight of beignets (one plain, one Ghiradelli chocolate, one apple cinnamon, and one crawfish) with a strong cup of chickory enhanced coffee. I also reccomend the gumbo, which is very basic but very good. This time around I tried a couple of items from their Special board: shrimp and cheese grits with bacon and the crawfish pot pie. Both are very rich, so if you have friends to share with it will be less intimidating. A couple bites of each dish are perfect. Personal notes: This place is perfect for brunch dates, hang-over meals, long lunch breaks. No dinner-- closes at 3pm everyday. Not good for large groups. This place holds like 12 people tops. Okay, maybe 15. But seriously, it's small. Don't look like an idiot by by passing the hoards of people waiting outside to go in and "put your name in." There is a sign-up sheet outside that you need to put your name on. If there are more than 5 names ahead of you, you'll be waiting 30-45 mins. If you need a cup of joe while you wait, put on your best "straight-face" and walk north east to Hyde/O'Farrell and grab a good cup of coffee at Hurghada. It's a safe place in an otherwise sketchy 'hood on a Sunday morning. They have good coffee, cute baristas and really interesting local art.

After waiting 1.5 hours outside to be seated here on a Saturday morning, i wasn't too impress with Brenda's French Soul Food.  I didn't feel too much SOUL here... more like i was DYING of starvation! The place is tiny!   The menu consisted mainly of brunch food with eggs and biscuits.  I can easily make this at home so i ordered the Grillades and Grits instead.  This is tender beef covered with a canjun gravy sauce.  It came with your choice of eggs, grits and a biscuit.  The beef and gravy were quite tasty but i couldn't care less for the grits- it looked like a pile of mush!  I should have gotten hash potatoe instead.  And eggs is just eggs...  I also had the gumbo and that was A-Ok.  The Crawfish Beignets is quite interesting (it comes in a set of 3)), it's like a filled donut with crawfish and it was a tad spicy and salty.   I also tried the chocolate filled Beignets- it was sweet and covered in powder but kinda too sweet for my taste I felt like everything was ok, but when you're starving... you're thankful for anything you can put in your mouth!  Would i come back here?  Prob not...

Ive heard this place has the longest lines imaginable on a weekday morning so we went around 9:30 to secure a spot. Luckily enough, Thursdays didn't seem to get so happenin' until around 10:30 or so. We were able to be seated right away at one of the very few tables. Nice minimal environment with a friendly waitress was a good start to an even better ending. The beignets were amazing! We got the sampler (good to try out, but was wayyy to much food--stick with one that sounds alright to you) plus some egg plates. My boyfriend got the plain ol' ham and eggs with toast and grits and I got the andouille and cheddar omelette with a biscuit and grits. I would give five stars but as soon as I started eating I could feel the grease starting to seize up muh insides and, eight hours later, I am still in fact burping up the flavor of greasy sausage and cheese. Tmi? Probably. Anyway, the food is rightly priced and there is plenty of it--I suggest getting the biscuit with your eggs. They're SICK! (The good kind, common of the hipster parlance of our times, not the gross kind) The coffee was, eh, okay. I may just not be a huge fan of chicory, but it had an acrid spicy taste to it. All in all, since we didn't have to wait for days, the food came quickly, and I was good and stuffed for the rest of the day, I'd say it was money well spent.

II really enjoyed eating at Brenda's.  It's small, cozy, and sweet... a combination you don't generally find in the Tenderloin.  Though this small space does mean a huge wait, it's worth it if you've never been. I actually got to park right out front and wait in my car otherwise I'm not sure I would have lasted the hour it took to get seated. Once inside, it was cozy, but we were seated near the door and got blasted with cold air a few times:( The food was delicious and nice big portions! I had the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette  with the hash and a biscuit...best damn biscuit I've ever tasted. We also tried the beignet, they were delicious as well. My boyfriend had the french toast which was also delicious. All in all great food, nice atmosphere if your wiling to wait. I'll definitely be going back soon.

1200+ reviews already so I guess I'll make it short. Great place for breakfast/brunch but I'm not sure if its worth the 1hr + possible wait time.  Maybe if you went on a weekday it would be worth it. The crawfish and chocolate beignets were delicious.  The grits were good too but be prepared for buttery creaminess overload 0_o I do recommend the high-town fry (oyster and bacon type scramble) and watermelon sweet tea as well! Street parking is plentiful but @ $3 per hour, bring dem quarters or have a parking card.  Plus parking is a 1 hour limit is most spots.

So a friend and I randomly decided to get brunch one Sunday morning. I remembered hearing about Brenda's French Soul Food so we opted to give it a try. We waited about an hour to get seated which wasn't too bad since we just walked around the area. The place is quite small and I can see during the weekday how parking would be difficult to find. We ordered: The beignet flight - very interesting and tasty. I really enjoyed the chocolate and plain one. The craw fish one is very unique and really tasty too. The apple cinnamon one was ok. Grillades and Grits - the sauce was good, tho I think the meat was a little dry. I've never been a fan of grits, but I think these were good. Egg and Bacon Tartine with Hash - it was very tasty. I enjoyed the hash. Watermelon Ice Tea was unique and refreshing. Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely somewhere you should try at least once!

woke up at 845am on a saturday morning which is RARE, got here by 930am and wrote my name down for party of four and had to wait till 11am. Luckily it was a warm and sunny day, of else I would not had wanted to wait. My party ordered the beignet flight. Very big portions, I think I got a bit full from eating beignets only. I enjoyed all of them! each one was so unique. Chocolate was yummy..crawfish was quite unique, granny smith apple reminds me of apple pie, and even the plain one was good!!! I ordered the sweet watermelon iced tea also since everyone else mentions it in their reviews. It taste very refreshing and I wish they have free refills! My boyfriend and I split the gumbo soup in a cup, which I realize it was surely not enough for me and him to split. One of the best gumbo I ever tasted. YUM I had the Andouille and cheddar omelette, and I couldn't even finish it since I was full from the beignets. Luckily, my boyfriend helped me out a bit. Potato hash was pretty darn good as well. Everything was perfect and I am not even a breakfast type of person.

The menu is filled with so many delicious items. Couldn't try them all so I will be back for sure. As for now, the Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict rules. Delicious with hash, the grits were good but I prefer the hash. Watermelon iced tea is also a must. the end of ptI. For sure will be a pt. II .... The place is super small but I guess the 1.5 hour wait isn't too bad. Walk over to Fatlace and buy some stickers then walk back and you should be on time for your party to be seated :)

I always wanted to come here for brunch, but dreaded the wait. If not for the big sale in the city, I wouldn't have driven all the way to SF. But, I overheard people coming all the way from Sacramento.... I finally got seated after waiting for an hour or so. The place is super small... almost the same size of a cable car. Okay, a little bigger than a cable car.. it's that small. If you have kids with you, bets not bring a stroller.. you will have no room to move that thang. My party ordered: Banana's Foster: nothing different about it. I wasn't too impressed. Presentation-wise, I like my french toasts stacked. Shrimp and Grits: Best thing ever!!!! I worked out all week to eat this and it was all worth it. It's cheesy, creamy, spicy, and full of flavor. I didn't see this on the regular menu. It was part of their "Special Menu" Beignet flight: chocolate and crawfish were my favorite. Didn't really like the apple, it was a little dry. The plain one I ate with their strawberry jam! Yum-O!!! Strawberry jam: I wonder if it's homemade!?!? It was really good. I ate it with my biscuit and plan beignet. It's not so sweet and refreshing. Sweet Watermelon Tea: Free refill!!!! love love love Parking wasn't bad at all.

Beignets - Chocolate - YES, YES, YES Gumbo - excellent, but last time I ate it was burnt. Shrimp & Grits - I went to grad school in the South, and this has a bit too much flavor (sauces), too much cheese and not enough grits. I would go for the beignets alone, but the rest is just ok (super rich and buttery). 3.5 stars but adjusted for the wait = 3 star.

Overrated. It was my first time coming here and it will probably be a long time before I will go again. The wait was not as bad as others. I guess that's because we came on a Monday morning. However, it was full around 11:00 and we had to wait about 15 mins for a table. When I first walked in, I realized why there's a long wait.. Not because the place was extremely busy, it was because the place was extremely small and the food takes a long time to prepare. I was also stun by how dirty and old the place looked. It was not a good way to start this highly rated dining experience. The waitress was relatively friendly but a bit overwhelmed even thou there were 3 of them and only 8 plus tables and a bar. The place was s cramped they barely have space to turn around. I would hate to work under such condition, but hey.. maybe the tips are good. Our food took a long time and it was totally not worth the wait. "The Flight" of Beignets were so not worth it. It was hard and poorly made. The plain was actually better than the other three. The chocolate was extremely sweet and the craw fish was actually bland. It looked delicious but it did not taste good at all. We also had the oyster sandwich and the ham and what was essentially a ham and cheese sandwich. The oyster sandwich was good. The oysters were fried to perfection and the bread was not too hard. However, the ham and cheese sandwich was burnt and dry. I would disappointed that the food was of such mediocre quality given their long wait time. The watermelon drink was not as good as people say. It was not refresshing at all. The coffee was also burnt seeing that it was sitting on top of the heating pat the whole moring. Finally, the kitchen looked extremely dirty and cramped. I question the overall sanitary condition of their kitchen. It just made the overall dining experience less appealing. Bottomline is, this place is not worth the 1hour plus wait that some are willing to put up for. I guess people fool themselves into thinking that the food is better because they waited so long for it. It is so not worth it. I will not go back again... Frankly I dont see a reason to.

Let me start with the bad: (1)its LITERALLY a HOLE in the wall. I mean that in every sense of the way (2) Because its a hole in the wall, every time you slightly move you run the risk of elbowing someone in their head(depending on where you are sitting) or the their side. Now we have gotten the bad out of the way, lets talk about its GREATNESS. The service was great, everyone was really pleasant and I didn't feel rushed at all,even though they had millions of people waiting outside for a table. I ordered the Andouille Sausage and Cheddar omelette, it was delicious. Why  was  it delicious?  Because I, as an avid mushroom hater, I enjoyed them so much inside this omelette as well as the scallions that were inside them as well. It came with potatoes that were perfectly seasoned and an absolutely superb biscuit. I also tried the plain beignet(which comes in an order of three),I wasn't the biggest fan of those,there were good,I was however expecting something else. My friend ordered their French toast with butter pecan sauce. All I can say about that is this:ITS TO DIE FOR!! So buttery sweet and the french toast was cooked almost to perfection. I've never been a big on pecans or anything that tasted like pecan,but that french toast has me wanting to try more butter pecan anything!! Overall, great place. Sure it's as small as a hole LITERALLY and yes maybe you will elbow a few people their head or side every now and then, the wait depending on when you go can be pretty long, and yes two or three people may pitch you a genius tale as to why you should spare them and a dollar and fifteen cents,but it really is all worth it for the great service, the flavourful andouille and cheddar omelette or the cooked almost to perfect french toast topped with a TO DIE FOR butter pecan sauce.

I was looking forward to breakfast at Brenda's so-much-so that I looked at the menu online for days leading up to my little weekend in San Francisco.  Maybe that's where I went wrong...overexposure? The best things: we didn't have to wait in a atrocious line since we got there minutes before they opened the door.  The service was great...super friendly and prompt, my coffee cup never ran dry...mark of a good breakfast place in my opinion. The food, don't get me wrong, was good but not worth going crazy over, perhaps we did order the very best items Brenda's has to offer.  Here's what was for breakfast: Order of the original beignets...three piping hot decadent pillows of sweet fried dough...delicious!  Especially smothered with the preserves conveniently set on every table.  Definitely my favorite part of the meal! Egg and Bacon Tartine...just a little too blah, the best thing was the tangy tomato relish dolloped on top.  The combination of bacon, egg, and gruyere should've knocked my socks off but I think the huge slab of french bread served as the base of the dish took over. Buttermilk pancakes with toasted pecan sauce...my dining buddy wanted real maple syrup with his pancakes but they only had the imitation stuff...big bummer...so he opted for the extra charge and ordered a side of the in-house made pecan sauce.  It was super sickly sweet, if you're into smothering your pancakes with a slice of pecan pie this is for you, we weren't that into it...sorry. I would want to come back to Brenda's and give it a second shot...and order those beignets again!

Food was greasy, cheesy, heavy, fatty...and DELICIOUS! I got the hangtown scramble - fried oyster, bacon, egg scramble with grits and biscuit. It was amazing. Huge fried oysters and chucks of thick bacon. The beignets were good...not amazing. I thought they were a little too hard and over cooked. We got the flight and i was really looking forward to the crawfish one but the original was the best because it's softer than the ones with filling. Unfortunately, the service was really poor, but it was 100 degrees in the restaurant that day and it was crowded. I guess I'd be kind of crabby too.

Finally sucked it up and played the waiting game to eat here.  In short, Brenda's is not worth it.  Without the ridiculous shenanigans, Brenda's would be a ~3.5. I had the andouille omlette, which was really disappointing -- better eggs are readily available pretty much anywhere.  The potato hash was also a let down, with its wet, somewhat goopy consistency.  The biscuit was quite good, buttery and flakey.  GF gave a thumbs up on the grits. We had the chocolate beignets as well.  Very tasty, but I guess people don't really know what they're supposed to be like?  I've had them at Cafe Du Monde in the French Quarter, and these were way too tough and dense. So okay, a pretty average breakfast, with a highlight or two.  However, the wait, the cramped space, the locale (I've spent my share of time in the TL but waiting on the corner as the same bums become increasingly irate each time you say no?  No thanks), means I won't be making my way back.  There are plenty of better places to get breakfast around (aside: I'm looking forward to returning to the Mission Beach Cafe).

So the 1 con like everyone says is the wait time.   We waited well over 1.5 hrs on a holiday weekend on sat. so I guess that's about average.  You must be present when they call your name or you will have to rewrite your name on the list.   Cute little store, not big at all.  To get to the restroom, you walk through the little kitchen.  It might be some sort of health hazard but oh well.   The watermelon ice tea was awesome!!!  Such a simple idea but ohh it tasted good!!!   Got the sampler Beignets and substituted extra crawfish for the plain.  This was a little on the pricey side for 4 beignet but it was very tastey if you want to try all of them.  If you order just the apple, chocolate, or crawfish, it was more responsibly priced.  They were all excellent!!  Crawfish is a must try!!  I wasn't sure but am very glad I did.   French toast w/pecan sauce.  French toast was made w/sourdough bread.  It was average.  The sauce was good but I don't like nuts.  The people I was w/love it.   HangOut Omelet-with oysters & bacon, very yummy!!! I would never have but those two together but it was a decent size and was very tastey indeed!!  It also comes w/Grits which I didn't try and biscuit.   Overall, very glad I tried this little gem!!

It was 2.30pm on breezy Saturday with no expectation. Just randomly chose Brenda's as I recalled my friend said it's good. Parked right in the front, wrote my name under 2 other parties, wait less than 20mins, table for 4. PUURRFECT ! Just because I'm a die-hard yelpers, I took people's suggestion prior ordering. Turns out they are totally right, the watermelon ice tea and crawfish beignet were breathtaking. I never love fried dough this much, given the fact that I hate doughnuts. But now my soul is ready for having the next scrumptious beignets! I wonder if there's any line for take-out order, any ideas? Have I talked about the watermelon ice tea ? Well, I tried to preserve it by taking little by little sip, without knowing that it's free flow. Sigh, I really wish they have to-go bottle.

meh... My gf took me here for brunch on a Saturday and boy...it was packed!  The restaurant is definitely really tiny and if you're hungry...I wouldn't recommend coming here.  The wait took about 45min to and hour to be seated.  I recommend either telling your friends to come early or come when you're not hungry and put your name on the list.   The food was a-ok.  I was more intrigued with their lunch menu than their breakfast menu.  I was looking forward to having the sloppy josephine.  When they told me the lunch menu wasn't ready yet at 1pm...I was definitely shocked...since I had to settle with breakfast...I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine and my gf ordered the Fried Oyster Po-Boy.  We also ordered the Beignet Sampler and my gf ordered the water melon ice tea. Here's my take on the food: Watermelon Ice Tea - very refreshing on a summer day.   Beignet sampler - hmm just taste like donuts to me, but a very hard version...I've never had beignets before and I don't think they're suppose to be hard...the crawfish beignet was the on the salty side. Egg and Bacon Tartine - nothing special, just eggs and bacon over an open faced french roll with a side of hash browns (to me they were more like country mash potatoes, maybe I should have gotten the grits...) Fried Oyster Po-Boy - nicely cooked, though I would love the oysters to be more crispier.  The side of french fries...not a fan.  They were SUPER crunchy/hard.  If you like crunchy/hard french fries...then this is the spot for you.   Overall experience - Meh...I didn't get to order what I wanted and I didn't feel like the food had a French flair to it.  Though the wait was long and the food was mediocre, I can't complain that the meal was free (we ran into my gf's aunt who was sitting at the table next to us, THANKS PAULA!) so that's always a bonus =P.  Would I come back?  I would to come try the Sloppy Josephine...but I wouldn't order the beignets again...IMO OVERLY hyped by yelpers...

This place is extremely tiny, so of course there will always be a long wait. So be sure to allocate some extra waiting time if you plan to dine here. I went here on a Monday during lunch hour and still had to wait a good 30-45 minutes. The waitresses were very attentive and constantly checked up to see if we needed anything. I feel like they need to organize who is in charge of which tables because 3 waitresses came to us asking us what we would like to drink. Not that it's a flaw, it was really nice of them, but just something they could work on to be be more efficient and put less stress on the waitresses. I ordered the andoille omlette with biscuit. I really don't like potatoes (other than them as french fries) so at least they offered an alternative. I'm not too fond of biscuits either but for some reason their biscuits were just so damn good. The omlette was good too, not too heavy. Their watermelon iced tea was SO GOOD. Definitely order it!! It's worth it. Overall, good experience. The wait sucked, but what can you do with such a small place.

This place is soooo good!!! it's pretty much a 4.5 star! i came here on a weekend and ordered the eggs benedict with catfish, potatoes, and the watermelon tea! omg... the watermelon tea was the most refreshing drink! i've always loved watermelons and tea.. but the two together? brenda's made it happen! my meal itself was delicious as well. the sauce was rich but not too heavy and mostly on the side so that i can control how much sauce i wanted with my meal. the potatoes were nicely seasoned... and most importantly.. my food was served warm and prompt. My ONLY qualm about this restaurant is that the wait was a little absurd. i came around 11 and still had to wait about 45 minutes.... and this was with two of my friends arriving 50-60 minutes before i did to put our names down on the wait list! cant say it wasn't worth the wait... but man... wish they had a bigger place.

You know how some people exaggerate and say that they've been waiting for an hour.. when really, they've been there for half? Well, the wait is literally an hour on a Sunday. No kidding... I saw the reviews about the long wait, but wasn't sure if people were exaggerating until I saw the massive crowd congregating at the front. And the wait is totally worth it! It was my first time here today. Based on other people's recommendations, my friend and I ordered the beignet flight sample platter to split and I ordered the eggs benedict (daily special) with catfish, and my friend ordered the shrimp and goat cheese omlette. Goodness, there was enough food to fill four! The food was incredibly tasty -- I forget the sauce they put on top of the eggs benedict. It's not the typical hollandaise sauce, but it's just as good. I just wish my stomach was big enough to finish everything! Anyways, would definitely come back here again! But will have to think about coming back here on a Sunday. I would've given this place 5 stars, but one of the servers was not so friendly. We asked what the specials of the day were and she directed us to the mirror lining against one side of the wall, and left. Given that we were sitting in the corner opposite of the menu, I don't think it would've taken her much effort to just tell us what it was rather than have us guess what it was. (Luckily, eggs benedict was written right on top - one of the few items I could make out!)

This was me and Oliva Tanquilut's next step towards finishing the 7x7 list. I've been looking forward to trying this french/soul food fusion restaurant for a while, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We got here around 1:00 PM for a late lunch. Parking wasn't too bad, but maybe we were just lucky. We put our names on the sign-in sheet, and were seated in 10 minutes. It felt like forever since we were standing outside in today's 95 degree weather. We decided on the Crawfish Beignet, Gulf Shrimp Po Boy, and the Sloppy Josephine. (BOO!) Crawfish Beignet [$6.00]: HARD and CHEWY. It took too much effort to slice through this monstrous bun-looking thing. It tasted like the baos I overcook in my rice-cooker. I would've liked more stuffing even though the crawfish was salty (maybe because it's so fresh?) (MEH!) Gulf Shrimp Po Boy w/ french fries [$9.50]: I thought it was similar to an animal burger from in-n-out (tomatoes, lettuce, & thousand island) except harder to eat. We thought it'd be hard to eat if we put the sandwich together so we each just took a side. It was ok; nothing memorable. The french fries had the fresh potato taste that I love, but was also too chewy. (MEH!) Sloppy Josephine w/ cole slaw [$8.50]: It was good like most sloppy joes usually are, but I'm sure anyone could've replicated it from the canned ones.  The cole slaw was fresh, but didn't have enough mayonnaise. I saw everyone ordering the $2.00 "fresh watermelon iced tea" so I ordered one to-go for myself. I didn't think it was anything special; it basically tasted like fresh watermelon juice. This place was too squishy for me, especially when there's no AC on a hot day. I was sitting so close to people that I was forced to hear their personal conversations. SORRY BRENDA! I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

I came, I ate, it was okay :) The best part for me was the shrimp & grits.  It was hot and creamy and cheesy and chock full of flavor.  Beignet flight - tastes like you would expect, watermelon iced tea - didn't like so much. If I were twice as hungry as I was that day this might've been a better review.  It's very rich food.   Highlights:  cheesy shrimp & grits

This place is a great example of an excellent hole in the wall.  The wait can be long, but it is worth it!  Quite simply, the food here is oh sooooo good!   Since I was in SF for an extended weekend,  I decided to come here-- twice!   I had a chance to try  the shrimp and cheese grits,  gradillas and grits with scrambled eggs and a hearty biscuit, flight sampler binet's  which included crawfish creole, apple with honey, Ghiradelli with chocolate,  and original,  cup of gumbo, coffee, and sweet watermelon tea.  All these dishes tasted great and if I were in SF for a few more days I would have tried everything on the menu.   But, what really stuck out to me was there special of Pumpkin Pancakes.  It wasn't a regular on the menu, so I wanted to give it a try, and I was so impressed.  The pancake had a fluffy texture, that had the right amount of pumpkin and sweetness.  Each bite was so good and quite honestly, I didn't want to share it...but I did!  I've tried my share of pancakes, dare I say that this is the best pancakes that I have tasted.  It may be a seasonal thing, but I would like to try those pumpkin pancakes again.

NOT WORTH THE WAIT! I was the dumbo who waited 2 hours for this place. The food was OK, the beignets were OK, the service was OK. Why is this place so popular? There's nothing that stood out about this place. I would only go back if I could walk right in. The long wait just put a damper on the experience. If you go 30 minutes before they close, you won't have to wait long and you might have a better experience than me.

Good atmosphere and good food.  This is a very small restaurant even though the sign inside says capacity is 40.  That would be 40 very small people, standing shoulder to shoulder.   I enjoyed the beignet flight and the watermelon tea.  Many of those around me had the shrimp and grits which looked great.  They all seemed to enjoy and convinced me that on the next trip, it is a must.   Friendly service though I wasn't offered a refill on my tea.  :(

Sadly the beignets didn't do it for me :( From all the reviews I was sooo exited to try the foursome of chocolate, plain, cinnamon apple and crawfish... I've only had one other beignet from a small food stand at a farmer's market at home in Hawaii and they are sooo much better at home :) The beignets at Brenda's were kinda tough not soft and fluffy. This review should not stop you from trying it! you may like it haha Onto the BETTER :) I loved the watermelon iced tea! Oh my goodness gracious I wish I can recreate it at home and drink it everyday! They scoop it out of this gigantic southern jar into your cup and serve it to you which i thought was super creative. I also ordered the shrimp po boy and it was awesome. The fried and battered mini shrimp are served on sliced french bread that it toasted with lotsa butter.... mmmmm butterrr....

This was a long wait, but I was entertained by the other folks waiting to get in.   I LOVE the watermelon ice tea and I'm thinking about how I can replicate it.  It's refreshing and what makes it better is the free refill.  I will have to say my favorite is the crawfish beignets. YUM! I have to admit that Southern food isn't my thing, because I'm not a fan of rich food.  I was prepared for this. I though the biscuit was buttery alone so I couldn't imagine putting any more butter on it. I can only eat so much of buttery items.  It was my first taste of grits and the first few bites were nice and then I didn't want anymore. I had help consuming the rest of the items.   I will come back for the watermelon ice tea and the crawfish beignets!

The wait is extremely long but the eggs benedict was worth the wait.  They poached eggs sit on a biscuit which literally MELTS in your mouth. I had a bit of my friend's cheesy grits and it was also REALLY good.   Definitely recommend trying this place out once, but not when you're extremely hungry because you will end up waiting at least an hour for a table (during peak times).

Five starts for sharp, friendly, swift service. Two stars knocked off for high percentage of douchebag clientele and mad wait time. Can't really go too wrong with deep fried dough drowned in powdered sugar. And melted cheese on grits is truly a delight. That said, no dish is worth waiting 55+ minutes for a table in a sliver sized venue. Indulged the stretch due to my companion, who'd recently returned from a trip. Dinner is now being served - perhaps more reasonable wait times will increase my appreciation for the nosh.

Everything that we had was DELICIOUS.  I was in heaven with the beignet flight, especially the crawfish one.  The watermelon iced tea was good but I was expecting it to be better.  Maybe next time I'll ask for a glass full of ice because when I think of iced tea i think of it being super cold.  Whatever the small pickled side dish was that was served with the fried chicken was soooo good and I was sad that our waitress didn't pack it for me when I asked her to. I can't wait to go back and try one of the po'boy sandwiches.

Came here with three others for an early lunch and it definitely lived up to the hype for me.  The sweet watermelon ice tea was good, not too sweet, and refreshining, but not some kind of mind blowing experience as I had read on some of the reviews here.  Got the crawfish beignets and a side of grits.  Both were SOOOOOOOOOOO good and the portions for the prices were pretty huge.  Couldn't even finish my lunch and didn't even eat since the afternoon before.  Managed to finish the bowl of grits though, since they were so damn perfect.  Liked the decor and the airy feel inside.  They won't seat you until your party until everyone is present and don't forget to write your name on the chalkboard.  I'll definitely be back to try some other things on their menu as a bunch of stuff on their specials board looked pretty intriguing.

One Sunday, I went with a couple of friends on our way to the airport.  It was really a spontaneous idea to go to this place.  It ended up being a good experience.  We had to wait a little over an hour but managed to kill time by walking to Phil's on Van Ness.  Thank God the weather was great! We ordered the Crawfish beignets.  It was interesting in theory but I probably would not order it again.  I would probably opt for one of the sweet ones if I ever go back.  I decided to order one of the specials: Sweet Potatoe pancakes.  I was on the fence about ordering it as I usually do not want anything too sweet in one meal.  But when I took the first bite, I was soo happy I ordered this dish.  They were very moist and not overly sweet.  My friends ordered the Eggs Benedict w/ Catfish and the Shrimp and Goat Cheese omelette, respectively.  Both of those dishes were just as tasty, too.   The drawbacks were (of course) the wait and it was a tight fit inside.  But the prices were reasonable and the service was good.  I would definitely like to try this place again whenever I return to the City!

Wow. Wow. Wow. I just started looking at what possibly could constitute less than 4-stars here. I laughed when the first thing I saw was someone mentioning that the staff was "too attentive." Really?! Anyway, crawled out of bed one Sunday morning when we decided this was the day. The day to do Brenda's. Before I just drool all over me, my keyboard and my work neighbor, let me note the ONLY con was that we decided to make the trek a good hour too late. We got there at 11:30, and ended up waiting just over 100 minutes, and it was worth it.. all the way. We pulled into Philz on VanNess and chilled with some java, took a long walk around the hood.. all good. But, lessons learned.. I would also say it was too loud to talk.. that assumes one is trying to talk. I was so inhaling my food, it didn't matter. so, the FOOD....! Crawfish beignets -- Holy f'n cow. Gumbo -- Ho-a-lee f'n geesh. Shrimp and Grits -- WOW! Fried Green Tomato Benedict -- Ho-ly sh...! (a couple other things I can't remember cause it's been a couple of months) Hadn't tried chicory coffee in awhile. Pretty yummy. Anyway, like they need another 5-star review... but, nexttime, we're getting there before 10:30. Maybe even 10, but it was Sunday. TIP: I hear that their dinner is the best kept secret (oops... not any more!) since it's just started and so not on most radars. I'm sure it will be soon.. it is for me now. Enjoy!

If i was not from New Orleans I would have given this place four stars. But i broke the cardinal rule of not eating New Orleans food outside of New Orleans. So with that being said the watermelon tea is good, the beignets tasted as if they just fried some biscuit doe without flattening it out. I personally think I make better cheesy grits. The crawfish beignets were pretty good but not of New Orleans standards.

Did some research on Brenda's with my fiance and we decided to try it out when we were in the city.  The location at first seemed somewhat sketchy with all the birddogs(hobos) wandering about but once we got inside we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the flight of beignets and the shrimp and grits. The beignets were bomb dot com favorite overall was the chocolate filled beignet. The shrimp and grits would of been great if it wasn't nearly covered in a plethora of cheese. One last note like every other review has stated, do get the watermelon iced tea.

I can't believe it took me this long to discover this place. The food is nothing less than orgasmic! It is relatively inexpensive and the portions are generous. Their biscuit is the best damned biscuit I have ever eaten in my forty-six years of existence on planet Earth! The service is attentive and friendly. My sole words of warning: beware of food coma!

Decadence is knocking down the door to Brenda's French Soul Food.  The food here is so rich and yummy!  I love beignets and I have always been purist when it comes to these fluffy donuts.  I used to believe that you can only get good ones in Louisiana.  But oh how I am wrong.  Their crawfish beignets are so delicious. 3 come in an order, and it is a great way to start your meal.  Just think of it as a gigantic amuse bouche! So far, I have tried their crawfish potpie, their oyster scramble and their shrimp and grits.  I cannot handle myself around the shrimp and grits.  The bacon and tomato gravy is so beautiful it can make a grown man cry...which I have witnessed with fiancé.  I always order an extra biscuit because this is something you cannot share, it is simply too good.  To wash it all down, you need to order their sweet watermelon tea.   It is a super tiny restaurant and you when you arrive, you put your name on the list.  Beware...you need to be around when they call your name.   They do not hesitate to move to the next person on the list.  I learned my lesson and do not come on the weekends anymore, when the wait can be around 2 hours.  I only come during the week and the longest I have waited was 15 minutes.   This is the place where dreams come true.

OMG, all I can say is yum yum yum. If you crave some serious breakfast with a southern twist, you must try Brenda's. I went there with my boyfriend, I got the french toast with the butter pecan sauce and my boyfriend got the grillades and grits, and we got the craw-fish beignets to share. It was super flavorful. The grits were very authentic and the craw-fish beignets were fluffy and savory goodness. My french toast balanced everything out. We went on a random weekday at 9:30 and it was full. I recommend you get there expecting but wait, but it is well worth it. I will definitely be back. :)

I went here for lunch during the week.  Brenda's is tiny, but there was no line and no wait.   The food here was good, nothing spectacular.  A decent version of New Orleans cuisine, but not as good as a lot of the food you can get anywhere in the Big Easy.  In my personal opinion the Gumbo was a little off. Too watery and not very flavorful.  However the turkey sloppy joe, coleslaw, fries I had were all tasty.  The french fries were actually perfect.   I'm giving it four stars because the food was good, and the service was great.  Super friendly and efficient.  Plus, they did a great job of always keeping my water glass filled.  Something that is lacking in a lot of restaurants these days.  Can you help a thirsty hung over person out waitrons? I'll definitely go back, because are so many good looking things on the menu and specials board that I didn't get to try. Laissez Les Bon Temps Roulez.

OK, that was scary good. Sloppy Josephine with fries was the order for lunch, while the service was a bit slow, the payoff was piping hot fires and overflowing deliciousness in the form of an incredible kaiser bun and crazy good sloppiness. This lunch was a gut bomb, but in the best way possible.  Definitely exploring the menu...

Overall:  Delicious, but on the heavy side....uh, it's called "French Soul Food"  do the word math. Flight of Beignets: Wow! The apple beignet was piping hot on the inside and smelled so deluxe I could not wait to taste it. And it was like a mini-Thanksgiving pie! So delish and fresh, just the right amount of sweet and spice. The chocolate and plain beignets were equally tasty, I just prefer apple. I didn't try the crawfish...just cuz I'm not a craw fish kind of girl. Oh, and the fresh jam to top off the beignets was to die for. Bacon & Egg Tartine: The french bread was warm, soft and buttery with just the right amount of garlic. The scrambled eggs were piled on just perfectly with the bacon and salsa adding to the savory perfection of this dish. I was able to eat it successfully with my fork and knife! This is rare for anything that is on french bread, which most places make overly crispy so you are unable to use utensils with it. I had the grits, which were a little heavy for me, but were buttery goodness all in one cute mini bowl. Coffee: The chicory infused coffee was a welcome addition to this super rich spread. The only reason I deducted a star is for the wait...we were told the wait would be 45 min to 1hr. Left and came back in 45 min and we had missed our spot by three people on the list! Disappointed, we were told it would be another 45 min to 1hr. We waited around and got in about 30 min later. I wouldn't have minded waiting, but we are talking about hanging out in the 'hood for 1.5 hrs...not my idea of a fun time. Although I did learn during my endless waiting that you can get a $5 mani on Polk St.....mmmm...maybe not. To be fair, it was written on the wait list that you would miss your turn if you were not there when your name was called, but then I'm hoping the time to table estimate could be a bit more accurate. Regardless, our server felt bad and was super nice to us once we got in. Hey! He doesn't make the rules. :) Overall, excellent eats and I would come back in a heartbeat...but with my coffee in hand and ready to wait. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!

I went to Brenda's a few weeks ago and I am still dreaming of the Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions and cheddar beignets.  Amazing.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about them.   I used to frequent New Orleans once a year for almost 10 years before moving to the West coast and have found all Cajun restaurants falling short of delivering the promise of the New Orleans flavor that you can only get in that divine city.  I gave up hope of finding a place that can transport me back to the French Quarter.  That was until I ate at Brenda's.   I had the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese omelette and my boyfriend had the Grillades and Grits.  We had to switch off several times because we loved each others food so much.   We both choose to wash our brunch down with the watermelon ice tea, mmmmmm. Yeah, the wait sucks.  Bring a cup of coffee, a cup of yogurt and the latest edition of Vanity Fair and time will fly by.  Then prepare yourself for the best brunch.....ever.

Ok... I know I am going against the majority of reviews on here... but bear with me... Came here on a Monday for lunch... brought by my boyfriend who rated it a 5 star. So... I had some pretty high expectations. Needless to say... I was not impressed. I wasn't too impressed by the menu offerings as I thought they were quite limiting to someone who doesn't eat red meat or pork. (Ok.. my fault for going to a soul food restaurant.) I ended up ordering the turkey sloppy joes... which was just OK. Save for the fries... which are pretty hard to mess up, the lunch was a straight up 2 star meh, I've experienced better kind of a place. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it either. One other thing that I didn't care for at all is that they serve their soda by the can... which I hate since I love fountain soda and the refills that usually come with. In all likely hood I don't think this will be a place that I will visit again... but can definitely understand why it has its followers.

This place is great. The beignets are truly amazing - my least favorite was the apple and the favorite by far being the crawfish. Overall an incredible plate. I had a scramble with fried oysters, which was good, but a little too salty for me. I did however dip into my girlfriends catfish eggs benedict which was epic. Certainly the most interesting and best eggs benedict I've ever had. The hickory coffee is a great thing to have while you wait - and you will be waiting for some time. It took us 45 min. to get in on a Sunday around noon for brunch. Worth the wait. This is by far the best breakfast/brunch place I've found in Civic Center.

You know, I always mean to write a review for this place, but I never remember to. Since the thought struck me while I was close to a computer, I thought I'd take the chance to rave about one of my favorite joints in the city. Brenda's food is AMAZING, to say the least. There's always a ridiculous wait (expect at least 45 minutes, if you're lucky), but the food is always so, so worth it. If you've ready any of my other reviews, you would know that I being cramped and long waits usually drops my ratings down a star or two, but the food at Brenda's is always well worth the wait. Also, something about the teeny tiny restaurant seems almost homey and cozy in a way. They can get away with being that small because they can pull it off. The shrimp po'boy and the biscuits are delicious, but I'd probably trade my brother for the beignets. They're THAT awesome. The crawdad beignet tastes like a Hot Pocket, and not in a bad way. It's light as air, yet packs a solid punch of flavor. The chocolate beignet is also good, but I think the traditional, no frills, plain beignet is the best of them all. Also, I'm usually not a grits fan, but Brenda's cheese grits are the exception. If you haven't been here yet, GO. I almost want to give this place a bad review so there will be less of a crowd, but it seems almost criminal to deprive anyone of the tastiness that is Brenda's through deceptive means. I'll probably regret telling you this, but this place is definitely one of THE best breakfast/brunch places in San Francisco. Go. Trust me.

2 words...Fabulously Fatty! Yes, heartstopping gluttony in everyway. Our party tried the beignet sampler (the crawfish one being the best surprisingly!) banana fosters was fabulous, the catfish benedict (amazingly fresh fish and buttery biscuit!), and my husband had the grits with ribs which was a sea of mouthwatering goodness. Even the preserves were homemade. (strawberry was the best.) I only give is short of 1 star bc of the long wait we had (but hey it was worth it!)

Loved it! The beignets were amazing. We got the plain, which provided one for each of us (3) but I could've eaten them all myself. Next time I will try the other flavors, or get the sampler. I had the Grillades and Grits. Amazing grits! Grillades had a super tasty sauce, and the portion was huge, I didn't even get into the biscuit, but it was still delicious a couple hours later when I ate my leftovers. Great coffee, I had the watermelon iced tea and if you like watermelon, try it! I am not a huge watermelon fan, actually, I assumed the tea would be mildly flavored for some reason, so I probably won't get it again, but that's my fault. Very tiny, but we hit a break in crowds so we were seated right away, I will definitely return if I end up in the city again in the morning.

The line to this place is seriously no joke. I was there at 10 am on a Sunday and I think there were like 15 names ahead of me on the list, I waited for over an hour. I had read about the wait on yelp so I armed myself with patience, because the food seemed worth it, and it really was! The prices are good - breakfast for two, plus an order of the Beignet Flight, to go, was $27 plus tip. The portions are hearty, the biscuits were yum-my and buttery, not to mention huge. We had the omelette with goat cheese and shrimp, and the catfish po'boy. Everything was perfectly delicious and really well seasoned. I didn't like the watermelon tea, I really just got it out of curiosity and I thought it was kind of bland, personal opinion, others seem to love it. Overall, I loved the restaurant, menu, and food. The service was fast once you get in. My tip, make the most of the line - since you're there for a while, ask around to see what others recommend, it was helpful for me. I really liked Brenda's and highly recommend it. How can you go wrong with comfort food?

My friends and I were looking for someplace to eat breakfast and decided to come here and check it out. For a 28 seat place, it took awhile for 11 of us to get seated. When we got seated, we still had to squeeze ourselves into the small tables. That proved to be a little difficult as the portions for huge. I tried out the plain beignets. Pretty large size but not much else to can expect from it. I also had the two eggs meal which left me filled. Next time I think I'll come with a smaller party.

There is a wait list in the front door. If you miss your name being called they will make you sign the bottom of the paper and wait all o\ver again.  You will be waiting for at least an hour.   The wait is worth the wait though.  The watermelon ice tea is very fresh tasting and is made from scratch.  The seating area is cozy and you are lucky to get a table.  The workers are very friendly and nice.  The food was wonderful full of flavor..  The grits taste homemade , I would compare them to commanders palace in LA.  To tell the turth though I was so starving that I do not know if it tasted so good because I was so hungry or if it was just amazing food.   I can say for sure is that it fills you up!   The beignets are not traditional if you are use to cafe du mond in LA .  They do have a heavier texture.  It was still tasty non the less.

"Yes! Yes! YES!" That was me having a food-gasm over their chocolate stuffed beignets, which I devoured BEFORE my jambalaya arrived. It was that good. The jambalaya was really good, but the omelettes were delicious! I tried my friend's shrimp omelette and it was amazing. It also came with this ginormous biscuit that was buttery delicious. I also drank about two glasses worth of their watermelon iced tea before ordering my food. That tea is divine. My friend drank almost four cups and it was the greatest treat to see her later that afternoon desperately seeking a toilet. But she said it was worth a near bladder split for that iced tea. The wait is a while, it took about 1.5 hours for a table of 4 to be seated on a Sunday at 10am. The waitresses were also really rushed, so they weren't overly friendly. But the food is all that matters, and it was excellent! Totally worth the wait!

The food - rich and flavorful, service - attentive and not intrusive and the wait - long, as expected from a good place to eat.   We ordered the Croque Monsieur, Shrimp and Grits and flight of Beignets.  Croque Monsieur was fantastic - the ham, guyere cheese and bechamel sauce were done well.  The shrimp and grits - WOW!! the grits were creamy and the shrimp cooked to perfection. If you've been to New Orleans or have lived there, I don't suggest the beignets.  The beignets are too doughy and heavy not at all as crispy and fluffy on the inside like say Cafe du Monde.  You'll be disappointed with the beignets.  The filling for beignets were crawfish - fishy, chocolate - good and apple - okay.  It's crispy outside but doughy, heavy and not enough powdered sugar.   The biscuit that we ordered on the side was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  It was a great side for breakfast.  The homemade jam is not bad either.  In all I would come back to Brenda's for the food.

Not sure what all the hype is about. I called in a to-go order because waiting outside in the TL for 2 hours is unacceptable/intolerable for me. The catfish po-boy needed more sauce. Beignets were OK; I like the plain one best. I enjoyed the sweet watermelon tea the most. It was very refreshing and had fresh watermelon in it. :)

I went to Brenda's for the first time last week and it won't be the last.   I ordered the chocolate beignets (3 for $5) and the andouille and cheddar omelette.  The omelette came with a choice of sides: potato hash or grits (had the potato) and cream biscuit or toast (had the biscuit). The omelette and sides were great.  The sausage in the middle was very tasty.   I filled up on the omelette and sides and had to take the beignets to go for a snack later in the afternoon.  The beignets were also great.   I failed to see until after I ordered that the daily specials were written with a white marker on the large mirror on one of the walls of the restaurant.  The specials that day included red beans and rice, a po boy, and gumbo.  Had I seen the specials, I may have ordered one of them.  However, I'm very happy I ended up with the omelet. The person next to me ordered the crawfish beignet and after seeing it, I decided I just have to order it the next time I am at Brenda's.

I was actually a little disappointed. There are a ton of great reviews and to me the overall experience was fairly mediocre.  We had the apple beignet, veggie omlette and banana fosters French toast. Apple beignet- decent at best. Outside was too hard and the inside was piping hot. Veggie omlette- pretty fresh, fluffy eggs. Good ingredients. No complaints, bit didn't blow me out of the water either. Banana Foster French Toast- really good, really sweet. Maybe a bit too rich. Grits- extremely buttery

I got up 30 minutes earlier than usual on a weekday to catch breakfast at Brenda's before work.  Luckily, we arrived BEFORE it opened so we only had to wait 5 minutes until 8 o'clock.  However, if we had arrived more than 15 minutes after it opened, we would have had to waited much longer in line for the folks who did arrive at 8 to finish up.  Now onto the food.... I cannot say enough for how fantastic the food was!  I ordered the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette with grits and whole wheat bread.  The omelette was one of the best I ever had.  I usually just make boring simple omelettes at home, so this totally broke the mold for me. I ordered the grits for the experience since I've never had them before (thus I cannot compare to grits anywhere else), and I found them alright, but I would get the potatoes in the future.  As for the bread, I went conservative and stuck to my mainstay with wheat bread, but I saw other people who got the cream biscuits and they looked amazing, so I would definitely opt for those next time The quantity of food was also enormous.  I had enough leftovers for a complete lunch, and I'm not a light eater!   Overall, great experience, although I have to admit I don't know that I would wait an hour unless it is a special occasion.

[Review] The food was good. like a 3.8 stars. ahah. I love me some fractions. I got the Crawfish Pot Pie that comes with salad. The salad was the perfect amount of dressing and greens. Mmmmm. It tasted like thousand island dressing with red vingrette or something. My boyfriend tried the salad and really liked it too. The pot pie is crawfish soup with a big bisquit in the middle (pictures to come). It was a tad too salty for me, but flavorful. My boyfriend got the fried catfish sandwich. I like the way they toast the bread. They toast the inside so when you eat it, its crunchy on the in and soft on the out (no crumbs too!). It wasn't flavor explosion in my mouth but somehow I just kept biting the sandwich so it must be good haha :X. [Service] I dont know if it was an off day/really long day for her since we came after lunch but the server looked like she didnt want to serve us. She was only nice to us near the end of the meal.. when we were paying.. [Venue] The restaurant is extremely small. I think max capacity was 30 people. And the bathroom requires you to pass the kitchen through really tight spaces.. not ideal but the food was good :). I heard it gets real packed during lunch time.. so go at an off time like me :]. [Price] Crawfish Pot Pie - 10.95 Fried Catfish Sandwich w/ Fries - ~11.95* *I didn't pay so I think this was the approximate price.

If you don't plan on waiting eagerly for at least an hour to get seated, don't go to Brenda's over the weekend. The line is ridiculous. Good thing when i went for brunch, we had parked right in front of the door, so we stayed warm in the car waiting for our table. My lunch at Brenda's was much more enjoyable than my brunch experience. Brunch: Ordered eggs benedict with cured ham and a side of hash, crawfish beignets, and sweet watermelon tea. The eggs benedict were a major disappointment. After waiting for an hour to get seated, I expected the food to be worthy of the wait! But the benedict was so BLAH! The biscuit they use is way too heavy and dense. Even with the hollandaise sauce generously smothered on each bite, the texture of the biscuit takes away from the entire experience. The crawfish beignets was okay. I wouldn't be sad if I never had one again. The watermelon sweet tea is FABULOUS! Lunch: Shrimp Po Boy, Shrimp Grits, crawfish and sausage pot pie, and of course, the watermelon sweet tea. The shrimp po boy was DELISH!!!! The bread was toasted perfectly so that it was warm and crunchy but still soft. The fried shrimp was luckily not encased in a heavy batter, so you are able to taste and enjoy the shrimp. The shrimp grits is a mess of cheesy oozy goodness. (I'm salivating just writing about it)  The pot pie was okay...my least favorite of the three. When I went for lunch, there was no wait, and I was seated immediately. If you want to go for their breakfast items, don't worry, it's served all day everyday. So go on a weekday and save yourself the hour of waiting outside in the cold. Lesson from Brenda: Go for lunch, not brunch.

Definitely worth the wait! (though I am a little hesitant to say this because now everyone will stay and wait it out, making it a longer wait ha ha) Anyway, waited for about an hour and a half, but was lucky enough to wait inside (away from the cold & rain!). My friend and I ordered the beignet flight (with crawfish - the best!!!!, apple, chocolate, and plain - second best!!!!), an oyster and bacon scramble (interestingly good!), and an egg benedict with fried cuttlefish (the biscuit they used tasted like heavenly air - it was so light, fluffy and delicious!) Service was amicable; the host esp. was so nice and friendly. He was even nice enough to keep a group's name on the chalkboard though their whole party was not there yet.

I was weary about soul food, but this place is great! I love the flavors!! The savory beignets were very well made and I bought some for my co workers as well. You will immediately fall in love with the food, caveat: the food is greasy and while that is expected, I couldn't really tolerate the consequences from trailing away from my normal salad diet. Order the grits and shrimp! It was sooooo delicious, they get 5 stars for that alone!

Finalllyyy, got to eat here. All in all, I must say, I was not BLOWN AWAY in any means. If I were to return, I would not go for brunch, would go for a late afternoon snack to get coffee and beignets. Maybe I'll go back to try their lunch. After over an hour wait, we finally got seated in the tiny, overcrowded restaurant. (we had been waiting in freezing rain, too! I know no their fault) Ok the actual food: Out of six ladies, we all split the beignet appetizers, YUM! the crawfish and the original were my favorite! The apple cinnamon and the chocolate were good but as expected. I got Ice Tea which was QUITE TASTY and their coffee is also nice and hot in those huge coffee bowl-type mugs (which they serve while you're waiting). My friend got the Watermelon Ice Tea which was sweet but tasted like Watermelon juice (good stuff!). Moving onto the entrees: I got the Fried Chicken Benedict with Biscuit and Grits. (Note: I am from NC, so I have high expectations for soul food...) Fried Chicken Benedict - so so, the chicken was nicely cooked, but it really had no flavor. The sauce they had (in place of hollandaise) was a bit spicy which gave a nice kick. But I ended up adding even more hot sauce bc the overall taste was rather bland. Biscuit - HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, it was not buttery at all, but broke apart as soon as a tried to open it up...sadnesss Grits - ANOTHER LETDOWN, there was NO grit-like texture because it was so watery, and they put in sooo much cream/milk and butter that it wasn't like normal grits. I didn't know it was hard to mess up grits, but their's was definitely a disappointment. I tried the Potato Hash, it was nicely seasoned, but again nothing extraordinary. The service however was great, the lady was very nice and prompt on our drinks and really nice about our crazy bill asks. However, the amt we paid, and the long wait was definitely not worth the final food that we got. Their beignets are the highlight so far, but I'm going to try to return for brunch and see if it helps their review at all!

Crowded at lunch but good system in place to handle the waitlist. (chaukboard). Super friendly staff. Great menu. Good prices. Just ordered so still waiting on how things taste but all the tables around me have licked their plates clean.. Update: burp! good grub. Now I know why every table is full. Hush-puppies rock.

Waited an hour and a half for this place. Loved the beignets! Must have the sampler. I went with a friend and we ordered the watermelon tea, coffee, two cups of gumbo, sampler beignet, meat and grits, and shrimp/cheddar/grit dish. We figured since we waited an hour and a half, we need to make sure to taste everything. It was delicious! Despite all the cheese, butter and calories, it was worth every penny. If you go, you must try an entree  with grits.

Came here with a group of five at 10:30 on a Saturday morning, had to wait 1h15 for a table--definitely easier to get seated with a party of two. Walked to Peet's for some hangtime coffee and returned for a pretty unique brunch experience. We started with a beignet flight (apple, chocolate, plain, and shrimp and cheddar). The shrimp and cheddar beignet (of course split 5 ways) was the group favorite. We were tempted to order a round of five more, but someone talked some sense into us. The shrimp and grits were cheesy and buttery and swimming with bacon. I'm a big eggs benedict fan, and you have the option to have that with FRIED CHICKEN, which is incredible. The potatoes that came with it weren't so hot, but the french fries that came with the croque monsier were perfect. The croque monsier comes on some of the sourest sourdough bread I've ever encountered---but the CM was still the weakest thing we ordered, nothing special. We were full until nighttime. Can't wait to try this place for dinner!

I love this place! I came here on a Saturday afternoon at 12:15pm and didn't get seated until an hour later. Trust me people, it's worth the wait! I came here with my bf and there were about 15 other parties of 2 ahead of us but I didn't give in!!   We ordered a bowl of gumbo, shrimp and grits, crispy pork belly and grits, of course the beignet flight and watermelon iced teas! Our bill came to a totally of $46 and it's pretty worth it, I guess. The gumbo was so flavorful with chicken, sausages and peppers with rice.  The shrimp and grits!! Omg, the best sauce with the shrimp and grits.  Your mouth is just bursting with flavors and then I had the pork belly with grits that didn't compare to the shrimp dish.  The pork belly was crispy and tender with cheese melted on top of the grits. Beignet flight was a great deal but I only had a chance to eat the crawfish and the chocolate. I was soooo full that I had to box up half of my pork and grits and the other beignets I didn't even touch. If you like rich food, this is the place to go. If you're on a diet, don't even bother coming here and waiting in line. The portion is huge and there's just a lot of butter and cheesy goodness on almost all the dishes.  This place is your ticket to lunch and dinner even if you came with an empty stomach and ready to eat your heart out.

I went with a friend around 10 AM for Saturday brunch, and to my surprise, we only only had to wait approximately 15 minutes to get seated! I think it was just early enough that the lines don't start getting crazy until around noon time. We ordered the Beignet Flight to start - which had a variety of Beignets to try - crawfish, plain, apple and chocolate.  The crawfish one was definitely our favorite, super tasty! They all had a crunchy texture fried to perfection :) I'm a fan! We then ordered an eggs benedict, with fried catfish (we chose potatoes on the side).  This wasn't my favorite, as I felt that the catfish was a bit dry and salty, with the hollandaise sauce a bit on the heavy side.  I prefer if the hollandaise sauce was a little more light, to add a bit of flavor instead of being too overwhelming. We also ordered a Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelette, which contained mushrooms, scallions, sauce piquant.  I chose grit and wheat toast to supplement it.  BTW, the strawberry jam/spread that they have is divine, use it to spread over your toast!  I thought this dish was very delicious, although quite oily (I mean, what can you expect right?).  But I could see the oil seep throughout my plate from the omelette, definitely wasn't at all "healthy". The portions were quite large and we ended up bringing a lot of it home, to enjoy later : ) Overall, great brunch spot, good venue (though in the tenderloin- a bit sketch), and good service/ambience.

Definitely a long wait. We waited for about 35mins on a  Friday afternoon for two. We ordered the beignet flight, which includes four, a cup of gumbo, a mufeletta sandwich with fries and the Monsieur sandwich. My friend also got the watermelon ice sweet tea which tasted lightly sweet with watermelon flavor to me but I only had one sip. I will say the beignets aren't as good as the ones in New Orleans. They were a less fluffy on the inside. I enjoyed the fillings inside the beignets. The outside was too doughy but still tasted good. I really enjoyed the gumbo. It had chicken, sausage, okra over white rice. The mufeletta is not like a true mufeletta. I would say it was much more oily and also smaller. It tasted good but not the same. If I had never been to New Orleans I would have never know. I also didn't taste enough olive spread, which is fine with me because olives aren't my favorite. My friend enjoyed her Monsieur sandwich (gruyer and ham.)  The fries were super crispy. Like the random hard hollow ones from McD's but that they were all like that. We had plenty of food and took most of our sandwiches home. I want to come back and try the granola pancake and shrimp pot pie. Service was ok as I didn't get water refills until I asked. I drink a lot of water and so I had to drink my friend's.

finally came and lucked out on waiting less than 10 mins on a nice rainy Sunday afternoon (maybe due to the niners championship game)! It was a cute and modern ambiance where we were warm fully greeted immediately with tea or coffee while we waited. Ordered the beignet sampler platter (original, apple, chocolate, and crawfish) and of course the craw fish beignet was my immediate fav, light anf fluffy on the outside yet bold and spicy flavors on the in. Got the fried catfish Benedict which was so crispy and creamy at the same time and light and filling too. Service was quick and attentive do to their great system of you table assigned to not only 1 waitress/waiter but the whole staff crew to tend to your needs. I'm pretty sure I'm going to return to grub on the shrimp gritz son.

I love the food but HATE the wait!!! Food is actually worth a 4 stars but the wait was worth 1, thankfully the nice staff also netted a star or this rating would have been lower. Do yourself a favor and order the shrimp and grits!! It's amazing!!! The shrimps are big and perfectly cooked. The grits are smooth, the bacon gravy is tasty and the food holds up as I ate my leftovers 12 hours later :-) When this restaurant opens the other side that it is currently remodeling and (fingers crossed) starts taking reservations. I'll be happy to raise it another star but until then, we're stuck on 3.

Well it's been a good 6 months since I've been to this place. After my first mediocre experience, the lunch menu made me come back a second time. Came here about 2pm and it wasn't very busy at all. There were only 2 waiters in the place. This time, I was helped by a friendly male waiter, but the other female waiter who was there during my last visit was there, barking orders at him and the customers coming inside. She didn't seem very friendly at all. I ordered the shrimp and cheddar grits with a cream biscuit on the side. As usual, the cream biscuit was so good. The shrimp and cheddar grits was very rich. The grits were creamy, and it was loaded with cheese. I didn't really care for the somewhat spicy/mesquite sauce the bacon and shrimp was in. It just didn't make my stomach feel that great. I'd advise one not to eat this whole meal in one sitting unless your body can handle it; it took a few hours of walking around for my stomach to return to normal. Even though the food experience was much better than the first time, there's just something about this place that doesn't make me feel welcomed. I think I'm done with this place. There are lots of great breakfast places to explore in San Francisco. Brenda's needs to hire happier waiters/waitresses. It really does change your dining experience.

I absolutely love this place!  Some friends and I went on a trip to San Francisco, and when we asked our foodie friend, and San Francisco local, for a place to grab brunch, she recommended Brenda's.  There was a line outside, but after perusing the menu, we decided to bare the wait.  So glad we did!  The food is great, and their watermelon iced tea is amazing!  I ordered the crawfish beignets instead of the sweeter ones, because I have affinity for savory pastries, and it was very, very good.  My friend ordered the beignet flight, which was with the three sweet beignets, and they were all delicious, as well.  I also ordered the Croque Monsieur, which was perfection.  It was rich and flavorful and a great pair with the tea.  This place is so small, so there will most likely be a wait, but it's definitely worth it!

FINALLY got to try this... after 2 years of just being lazy and forgetting. Janette was in town and I guess 3rd time's a charm. Here's a tip: come here around 1pm on Mondays or Tuesdays to beat the rush. Most of my friends wait like 1 hour... but we only waited 5 min... which is great considering the parking is capped at 1 hour. Beignet Flight - 4 beignets: Plain, Chocolate, Apple, and Crawfish, all about the size of a clenched fist... which is pretty freaking huge compared to other beignets I've tried - Plain - tasted like a chinese donut/filipino carioca but without the oiliness. Sprinkled with just the right amount of powdered sugar... this was very good and simple. -  Apple - pretty much like a doughier apple empanada. The apples of choice were tart but not overly sour. The cinnamon was generous in flavor, but not in spicy bite. Out of all the beignets, this had the thinnest crust. Also sprinkled with sugar, this is a good finisher, but we had it first. - Chocolate - Bittersweet chocolate sauce in the middle of a beignet. The chocolate was pretty hot and a little thick, which was good. I felt the chocolate needed a bit more bitterness and less sugar, but it was still good. However, this was the least favorite of the beignets. - Crawfish - WOW. this thrashed all the other beignets. I know its a savory beignet, but wow, the crawfish was ultra tender and the sauce had a nice spice and tons of flavor, probably paprika. After trying the flight, I think I'd stick with the craw fish. Hangtown Fry - Pretty much a scramble with maybe a half dozen breaded deep fried oysters. The bacon in the scramble meshed will with oysters, adding a perfect smoky compliment to the oyster flavor. The potatoes that came with it were a little average (kinda soft, and not too seasoned). The biscuit was large (slightly bigger than the beignets), light, yet buttery, and crunchy. Next time, I'd opt for the grits over the potatoes. Shrimp and Grits - Theres a reason every one talks about these. You can't emulate them. Buttery grits covered in cheese, shrimp sand sauce... its a flavor eruption of sweet, salt, spice, and awesome. This is one of those dishes that ruins the menu once you've tried it, simply because its so good you won't want to eat anything else. Gritty, cheesey, shrimpy goodness. No words can really describe this awesome food, falling into my top 3 breakfast foods ever.

Well I had the goat cheese and shrimp omelet which was a different taste. I've definitely never had it before. It was okay but honestly I don't see the big deal. My service was okay. I want to come back and try lunch to better assess the different taste of the restaurant.

One of my favorites. I don't want to move back to the South, but I'm thrilled that Brenda's brings me a taste of it. New Orleans in particular, but their menu has my favorite aspects of Southern Cookin'In general built-in: smoky, hearty, fried, and not over-priced. I often go for beans & rice. Fried chicken, biscuits, beignets, and coffee with chicory all deserve a mention. Great for brunch, great for dinner, just great.

we arrived around 1:30pm for lunch. this tiny place was packed! luckily, we got seated right away! awesome. did a quick scan through the menu and decided which items we were ordering. customer service was overall just alright. not the best, yet not the worse. so not really any complaints here. started off with the watermelon iced tea and it's quite refreshing and enjoyable... especially when it's hot out! the three of us ordered the following to share: chicken, andouille sausage, and okra gumbo - this had a kick to it but it was really good! they had a perfect amount of rice in it as well and the okra wasn't slimey at all.   scrimp and grits - my first time trying grits... boy was this cheesy deliciousness! the scrimp was also cooked to perfection and not overcooked. crawfish and andouille sausage pot pie w/side salad - this was a special up on the board and i must say... this was also super cheesy. the pie was soggy, which made me sad. but the crawfish inside... so good! beignet flight - ok, so i can't really fully review this one because the three of us split the crawfish beignet. and took the other 3 to go... so it's sitting on my desk right now. the crawfish beignet was, of course, cheesy. but i loved the cajun spices and the fried goodness mixed together. overall - everything was really heavy and i'm still super full. maybe just a piece of fruit for dinner will do for tonight. i'll probably bring the bf here in about several months for brunch, so it's safe to say.. i will be back. and hopefully by then, they would've finished expanding to the space next door.

Worth the wait.  We didn't have to as it was 8 AM on a Friday.  I sampled the shrimp and grits off my wife's plate.  The shrimp was plentiful and the grits were nothing if not cheesy.  I suppose if you're not into really cheesy grits that may be a problem.  But the tomato chunks were so sweet and tangy.  I'd go back just to try a whole bowl.  I had the hanger fry which with a couple of dashes of Crystal was everything I wanted.  And the craw fish beignets are amazing.  They're huge.  An order of 3 means you're taking 2 of them home.  I would definitely return and soon.  You should check this place out if you want rich New Orleans inspired food.

If I was a San Francisco local, I would find immense pleasure (and not a little glee) in letting a sentence like "Oh, I'm just heading over to Brenda's" slip casually off the tip of my tongue every few mornings or so. Brenda's is one of those places that makes you wonder why you hadn't invited yourself over earlier. Here, brunch is cordial. Though the almost-nonexistent parking and 8-groups-waiting-to-eat-before-you may suggest otherwise, there is no way you won't succumb to the cutesy grace of the chalkboard waitlist. After you've scrawled your name down (with, no doubt, an artistic flare or two) and gone for one turn around the block with a menu in hand, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that a table is ready. The service is just as prompt and pleasant as the wait, and the food arrives in as good time as the service. Though the waitress worried, "You do realize there are 3 giant beignets per order, right?" we plowed on with  our order, undaunted. The steaming bowl of nutty chicory coffee that arrived 5 minutes later, alongside a tall, icy (and refillable) watermelon tea, should have foreshadowed our death-by-food experience in the minutes to come. Six beignets arrived first- Large pillowy cushions of creamy, spicy crawfish and sweet-and-sticky granny smith apple. A cup of gumbo appeared, brimming with savory meat and vegetable, comfortingly topped with rice and green onions. Grits came after-- a gluttonous, happy afterthought as we enviously eyed the plates neighboring ours-- and well... I could wax poetic all day about the grits. Ambrosial. Creamy. Buttery. Rich, like golden corn, like liquefied movie theatre popcorn, like the best mac&cheese you ever had as a kid. Surely bad for you, but oh so good, and who cares about clogged arteries anyway, when your corn porridge glows a soft and lovely, golden hue that burnishes your face like a revelation from on high? No matter what your cultural background, Brenda's will remind you of home. Bite into a beignet, and you will find that beyond the crisp and puffy casing, memories lie within, in pockets of spiced, fragrant apple and rich crawfish. A mouthful is all you need to take you back. (I personally recalled Taiwan, and I'm not even from there.) People-watching is only the next best part of being at Brenda's, where the wildly varied crowd can all agree on one thing: how much they enjoy their food. Something about the atmosphere feels as close to harmony as you can get. And I'm sure the construction workers to my right, and the elderly couple to my left, would agree. You can't feel excluded here. Bottom Line: So worth it.

So I went there expecting AWESOME food....Wow was I disappointed. Being from the south.... The Grits were HORRIBLE... I almost couldn't get the 2 spoon fulls down!! I know how to cook grits and this was a huge let down. The only plus was the Mimosa's and the Bacon... My BF got the shrimp and grits and it was so oily. This was a HUGE let down especially since we drove from the East Bay to eat there.... Don't think I will return. I know Good Soul Food and this was NOT it!!

A couple of friends and I were in town for the weekend and were being shown around the city. We literally came here directly from the airport, all of us on little to no sleep. Our friend casually asked if we were hungry and we all sleepily agreed since our check in wasn't until 3pm anyways. We got here Friday around 9 am and there was a wait (really? -____-) keep in mind we had  had no idea the hype behind this place but after i'd say 20 mins we were seated. This place is really cute and lively. We skimmed through the menu and ended up getting the Beignet sampler, Crispy Pork Belly Grits & Hash w/ poached egg, Andouille Sausage Jambalaya, Banana Foster French Toast and the Andouille Sausage & Cheddar Omelet w Potatoe Hash and man were we not disappointed! The servings were pretty big and being Asian we family styled everything lulz. I think everyone generally liked the Crawfish Beignet the best. The prices were decent, the waiters were nice and it was probably the first and best place we ate at the entire weekend (well that and Ike's, oh and Bi-Rite :) Ps. get the watermelon iced tea, soooooo goooooooooood!!!

Sigh... I finally get to come here for dinner for the first time they've renovated and it was only alright. Perhaps I ordered the wrong food but I was sooooooo looking forward to it and it was a little lackluster. The place itself is real cute- high ceilings, a beautiful mural on the concrete wall, a wonderful array of mirrors. We ordered hushpuppies as an appetizer without really knowing what they were... they were ok. They're a fried something and it came with a Thousand-Island-kind of dipping sauce that needed more depth. I ordered the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken). It came with a biscuit and a side of collard greens. First off, BEST COLLARD GREENS EVER. Sooooo delicious. I could have just ate that for dinner. The biscuit  was, as usual, buttery and crispy at the same time. The part that disappointed me was the fried chicken. While the outside was great texture-wise (it was fantastically crispy), I wished there was more spice. It came with a sweet and sour sauce that made me think of sweet and sour chicken... not exactly what I wanted. I wanted fried chicken, not Chinese food! My bf ordered the ribs. Also came with collard greens and mac 'n cheese. I had a taste and it tasted pretty good to me. He said it was ok, he had better. However disappointing out dinner was, I still think this place is great... for brunch.

Food was excellent.  I had the Cajun Vegetarian omelet and it was one of the best omelets that I have ever had!  The Granny Smith Apply beignets were also excellent (and quite large in size).  Based on yelp recommendations, I also had the Watermelon Ice Tea.  The ice tea was very unique and refreshing.  It was more watermelon juice than ice tea so if you are a fan of watermelon, I definitely recommend trying it out.  Brenda's doesn't get the fifth and final star from me for two reasons. First,  the host was not friendly and pretty rude to us because we had a friend who was running late.  Secondly, there was an extremely long wait to get in the door.   If you have the time to wait, I would recommend checking this restaurant out!

Good God this is the best breakfast I have had in SF. We went here for the first time today. We enjoyed the beignet sampler, the chocolate and crawfish were awesome. The apple was just so so. Be warned these are huge. My wife had the eggs and bacon with a biscuit. Eggs were perfect, nice crisp bacon and a fluffy biscuit. I had the French toast with pecan butter sauce. The French toast was awesome. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other items.

Went here with a friend for Saturday brunch. The wait was about a half hour with five groups ahead in line. I'm a believer in pricey places doing the basics really well and, well, I'm on the levee here. I had scrambled eggs and hash, plus shared chocolate beignets with my friend. Cafe au lait was reasonably perky. Eggs were nicely done. But the hash had very little corned beef, more like potatoes sprinkled with bits, and I had to put salt on everything. Three times!!!  And I am NOT a salt person (except for the occasional margarita I wouldn't know if I lost my shaker or not), so this is very odd. Maybe because there was too much butter in my system from the biscuits?? That said, my friend had a daily special, which was salty enough with ham and oysters. Don't feel the need to go back, except maybe to get a biscuit or two to go. For lighter, littler beignets another option is Boulette's Larder on Sundays...

I went to Brenda's this morning.  The service was nice, the grits were slammin'.  Coffee was hot and strong, (with chickory I believe).  Why not 5 stars?  Well the  (granny smith apple) bingnets were a litte tough.  Also the part of the dough near the filling was raw.  Also my omlette while super yummy had kinda cold filling so the cheese didn't melt.   I suspect that Brenda's is amazing on days that they are "on".  Today however was not an "on" day, and it was still good enough so I'd be happy to return.

I guess this place doesn't really NEED another review, but I thought I would anyways, just cause it's that damn good! Cheese grits. CHEESE. GRITS. If you are from the south you know that this is what it's all about. I love grits. LOVE them. But CHEESE GRITS? Now, that's the way to this guy's heart. I'm usually a traditionalist, so when i heard they stuff their beignets, i was very skeptical. But after having them (especially the crayfish stuffed ones!) I must say...a very welcome addition. I will say the the traditional beignets still pale in comparison to Cafe du Monde, maybe it's the dough, or maybe is the lack of powdered sugar, but either way they are still delicious. I've only been here once, but I do plan on going again to sample more of this place's fine cuisine and to add to this review... Plus, the head chef is a Filipino from New Orleans, just like me! Maybe that's why I am mysteriously drawn to this place....

My Bf and i decided we wanted a good brunch on a sat so we went to Brenda's. The wait was pretty average for brunch on a sat, like 45min-1hr. But we played it loin style and brown bagged some beers from the liquor store down the street. Aside from the bums pestering you on the street it was worth the wait The food was definitely rich and southern. I have never had a beignets before and it was a wonderful surprise. The craw fish mixture was soo cheesy and not fishy at all. I think i could have just ordered this and  i would have been full. But of course we ordered more. We shared the glazed pork dish with the country style yams which were good but i kept glancing over to some of the other tables and the regular country pot. looked way better, crisp and golden. The biscuit was amazing, so flaky and light, with the apricot/peach compote that is on the table is out of this world. It these little touches that make this place special. we also shared the gumbo, it was a little salty and NOT spicy at all. Overall i would most likely go back here, i am looking forward to trying the other stuff on the menu

Small, quaint, and bustley! The food is absolute delicious! Made to order in plain view it's very satisfying and worth the $$. Definitely worth a trip or two. I recommend going with friends and eating family style so you can experience a variety of their fare.

What to order when you get here. Park on the otherside of Van Ness if you can't find anything.  Lee's sandwich or Saigon Sandwich.  You ask yourself why do such a thing when you here.  I'll tell you but I am sure you already know if you drive by this place, an insane line.  Put your name on the list and get yourself a snack to handle the wait.  So the other things you should order are below. Be sure to go with three people as this can be a little much. Gumbo - Delicious Beignets sampler plate as they are all good but on this day I preferred the savory crawfish filled beignet Take a look at the specials on the mirror The biscuits are awesome so definitely order those over the toast French toast is ok but why order that if you are at a French place.  If you really want to French toast you should head to Mamas. I would stick to the other French dishes. I had to take home half of my breakfast as I was so full.  I know the wait can break a place but this place is definitely worth it.

Biscuits- Best I have had in the city. Little (big) pillows of flaky, crusty perfection. Beignets- eh.  I was really hoping for better. We got the flight,  and although the fillings were good (especially the crawfish), a beignet is really all about the texture, and these were a little heavy and thick-crusted. Coffee and our beef n'grits- really good. And the po' boy I spotted going by looked awesome. Come here, eat well. The portions are huge. If you can, make it a weekday field trip. We came on a Friday at about 10:30, and although the place was almost full, we were seated immediately. oh Yeah!

I waited outside in the rain for 1 hour and it was so worth it!   My friends and I tried the flight of beignets.  I would recommend eating them from plain to sugary to spicy . . . much like a flight of wine.  You first start with the white wine and progress to maybe a cab.  There is the plain beignet with no filling.  There is a beignet with chocolate inside (yum), apple filled beignet and my favorite:  crawfish beignet.  That beignet is spicy, so eat it last!  The food is hearty, so order the flight of beignets with coffee and split and entree.  Our waitress recommended the eggs benedict with catfish.  I would never imagine eggs and fish, but loved it!  The grits remind me of porridge soup, only it's buttery.  That alone will fill you up, so come on an emty stomach.  Prepare to wait an hour because there is a line out the door!  Go anyway!

I went on a Monday morning, so I didn't have to worry about a wait or anything. When we got there, they seated us right away and brought us our drinks: OJ and Coffee. The OJ was OJ (nothing special, but good) and the coffee had a great chicory flavor to it. While all of the specials looked great, we found some really good looking items on the menu: Te Beignet Sampler and the Granola Pancakes. It did take a bit of time to get them, but they were probably making everything fresh and we had no complaints when it arrived. The Beignet Sampler consisted of 4 beignets: 1 plain, 1 filled with apples and cinnamon, 1 filled with Girhadeli chocolate, and 1 filled with crawfish. The flavors on all of these were spot on, with the chocolate and crawfish ones being our favorite. The texture was a teeny bit off (I've been to New Orleans a lot, so I've had plenty in my lifetime). They were a bit dry in the middle, but that's really a minor complaint and nothing that would ruin the flavors or meal. The Granola Pancakes were really amazing. They were incredibly soft and almost gooey (but not undercooked), had granola cooked into them, and were topped with delicious fruit and a vanilla cream. I was really blown away by them. I'm definitely going back to try their lunches and specials

Now I know there are some hardcore Brenda-fans out there, and I do dearly love most of the food, but I gotta drop the 3-star bomb for two reasons. 1) the beignets are just not that good.  Actually, not good at all IMO: dry, flavorless, and boring.  I do like the various toppings you can order, but they're just not enough to overcome the dry bread.   2) the wait is a disaster.  Ugly street, nowhere to sit, no provisions for those in line, and WAY too long.  Yes, this is testimony to Brenda's popularity, but it's not comfortable and not fun.   That being said, all the other food is truly top-notch and delicious.  If it weren't for the wait, I'd be back for those ginger pancakes ever weekend.

Wow, this place is really "cozy" inside. Glad I'm not claustrophobic. The french toast is awesome, and I think it's the warm pecan butter that seals the deal. The beignets are superb, as good as (or dare I say better than) the ones I had at Cafe du Monde in 'Nawlins. The biscuit even was sinful buttery goodness, though ours was a little burnt. The chicory coffee was full-bodied and the perfect caffeine boost. Watermelon tea was just alright. Even so, I'd come back for sure if I'm in the area.

waited around 15 min=not bad getting seated and watched others get seated after, but served first = bad, bad, bad. That was the extent of my bad part. The food was interestin and good. loved the Beignets . the Crawfish one was the best!!! The omletts were very fresh and tasty. the price was reasonable but not cheap.

The biscuits are the best I've ever had. It made it worth the wait. They have what looks like homemade strawberry jam, which I generously added to my biscuit. The flavors of my shrimp and goat cheese omelet were perfectly balanced.   I'm going to go back, and get there when it opens to avoid the wait.

My 1st time at Brenda's was May 09. It was so nice I had to go twice. So~Cal has nothing like this! believe me, I'm lookin' 1st visit my hubby had the eggs benedict w/ fried catfish. I'm not a fan of fish and it was still wonderful. I had some kind a braised meat with cheese grits, it was the special. it was heavenly! We waited forever to be seated and it was worth the wait. The food was flavored perfectly and pipping hot. Most Def 5 stars. i said to myself, "Self, you will go to Brenda's every time you come to town" So when we came back Dec 09 you know i jumped on the 31 to hit my favorite b-fast spot in San Fran This time we were seated fairly quick and servers were just as nice as our last visit. hubby had the special w/ red beans n rice, very good but not the best I've had. I had grillades n grits and the lovely waitress accommodated me by giving me cheese grits because i love them so. while our plates were hot my cheese was not fully melted so it took away from the presentation and consistency of my meal. still go but not perfect this time. O' yeah, i don't like the neighborhood, it's a little depressing So will i hit up Brenda's "every time" I'm visiting? I may or may not. If you live in the Bay area and haven't been... shame on you. what are you waiting for?

My wife and I had a GREAT breakfast here this morning.  This place is tiny , but it is worth the wait. Bringing more than 4 people could be a problem. The staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  Come early because the line gets huge. Try the beignets, biscuits and the coffee.  These were all exceptional.

Not really worth the wait... I lived in New Orleans for two years while a student at Tulane, and I've been on what seems like a never-ending quest to find tasty, authentic cajun/creole food out here. Looks like the quest continues. Nothing about Brenda's was bad, it just wasn't mind-blowing. To be fair, I didn't try the biscuits, so maybe that's where I went wrong, I don't know. My friend and I got the shrimp and grits, french toast with pecan syrup, hash, plain beignets, and crawfish beignets between us. The regular beignets were kind of hard and dense instead of fluffy like I'm used to. The crawfish beignets (obviously not authentic, but sounded like they'd be yummy) had very little filling and the dough was bland. The french toast, while again not bad, wasn't that impressive either. I was expecting the pecan syrup to be dark and rich. It was really just pecans thrown on standard maple syrup. The toast itself was a little soggy and not hot. I can't really complain about the hash -- there are so many tasteless homefries here that I wasn't expecting much. I thought the shrimp and grits were pretty good, but I'd preferred that the cheddar had been incorporated into the grits instead of hanging out in a greasy, cheesy pool on top. Just mix it in! Overall, I was pretty disappointed. But maybe my expectations were just too high.

We arrived at 10:45am and didn't get seated until 12:30pm on Sunday.  Luckily it was a gorgeous day in the city and we walked down to the civic center to soak in a bit of sun. The crawfish beignets were on point - along with the special shrimp and cheese grits.  The watermelon iced tea was especially refreshing after having been in the sun. I looks like they are expanding their restaurant to the dry cleaning space next door - that would be fantastical.  Was it worth the wait? - yes.  Would I go back again? - absolutely, but at 8am when they open. :-)

I'm a brunch person. I love brunch. I can't remember which was the last Sunday I didn't go for brunch. I love trying new brunch places ever week. I was putting this one off for a long time as I remember one of my friend didn't like it. But this morning, I was going through yelp and I realized that this is the only one in top 10 that I haven't been. So, we went there. Waited outside for 40 minutes and felt lucky that the weather was awesome. Our server was super nice and welcomed us. We ordered a flight of beignets, Florentine Benedict with Grits and sweet potato pancakes. It was SOOOO DELICIOUS!! After every couple of bites, I was raving about it. I don't think that happened to me at any other place in San Fran. Oh, I forgot to mention about the Watermelon Ice Tea. OMG! It was sooo good. Overall, this is the best brunch I've ever had. Period.

Since its probably all been said before, I'll keep this short: Brenda's was everything I thought it would be...and a little bit more. Very reasonably priced, and just out of this world delicious. I will definitely be coming back...oh so many times. Recommendations: - Crawfish bignet (3 per an order make for easy sharring) - Chocolate bignet - Shrimp and grits (!) Avoid: The lines. It can get a little busy so come at least 30 minutes before you want to chow down.

Nice little place, worth trying. Like everyone else, I wanted to try the crawfish beignets. They were each about the size of a large apple. I was surprised by how large the portion was--they came in set of 3 and it didn't say so on the menu--and how crispy they were on the outside, making them a little difficult to handle at first. They were very good though--tasty and unique. The French toast with butter pecan sauce was also good, but there was so much sauce I wish I had asked for it on the side. I would have preferred 1/4 - 1/2 the amount it came with. I wouldn't attempt a group of more than 4 here. 2 would be better.

Went again.   It was good again.  I'm a fan.     Now let me say this... 1)  Yes the wait is long but depending on when you get there,  no longer than the wait at any good breakfast place on a saturday morning.  Its just that you have to stand out side and there is no where to sit.  Some benches, planters, topiaries, outside would be a nice addition. 2)  I usually don't order the beignets.  Its too much food and yes, they are denser and heavier than the ones you get at Boulette's or Cafe Du Monde. 3)I still swear by the gumbo and I'm waiting for the gallon jug size to become available at the grocery store. 4) If there is anything on the special board with the molasses ham in it.  Order it. 5)  Croque Monsieur = awesome 6)  Shrimp poboy + awewome 7)  Bananas Foster french toast = awesome 8)  Butter pecan french toast = awesome 9) the place is small and cramped and again the wait is long so if you are the fussy, complicated, impatient type - and you high maintenance types know who you are.....  then you'll need to go wait in the car while your friends stand in line. 10)  yes its tenderloin adjacent.  Suck it up, sissies. 11)  Please send all gumbo donations to  PO BOX 123.....

This is really excellent food at a very reasonable price. Of course, there's a non-monetary price in that you'll almost certainly have to wait a good while after you arrive because there's always a line.  It's the 'loin, so it's not super extra fun to look around while you wait, but there's a Philz one street over on Van Ness.  The Brenda's folks will definitely let you bring in your coffee (even though Brenda's also has pretty good brew).  Also, about half the people in line are hipsters, so you can compare and contrast LCD Soundsystem with Panic at the Disco or something.  Or if you just hate hate hate waiting, get there at about 2:30pm. Anyway, the cajun-spiced beignet was my favorite; not crazy hot, but enough zing to wake up the old tastebuds.  Make no mistake, this is 'soul food' in the sense that it's *heavy.*  There's a lot of oil in them there hills of food, so it can send your tongue into the sleeper hold if you're expecting froo-froo fare.  I was the first time I came, and my wife told me "It says 'soul food' right in the subtitle.  What did you expect?"  Shamed at my poor reading-comprehension, I changed the subject. In any case, I'm an elitist latte liberal, so this really isn't my kind of food most of the time, but when I want to revisit my vaguely Waffle House roots Brenda's is the way to actually have fun doing so rather than being smacked in the mouth with the truth that I'm no longer capable of enjoying mounds of unvariegated grease and (high fructose corn) syrup.

My boyfriend and I were down in San Francisco visiting and heard about Brenda's. I'll admit my first impression wasn't that great, we had to wait outside on a street that was not the nicest (we went early, for breakfast). However, the waitress was really good at seating us in the order in which we came (they did not have a list to sign up on). Once inside, I realized the proficiency of the waitresses. They were kind and orderly and our glasses were never empty. We started out by getting The Beignet Flight, which is a sample of all of the Beignet (Plain, chocolate, granny smith apple and crawfish). Even though we were nearly full, we proceeded to order entrees. He got the Grillades and Grits (the beef cutlets were amazing!) and I got the French Toast with pecan sauce. Both were SO amazing! The food was fairly priced, especially for the taste and size. The most important thing though, if you go here, is you MUST get the watermelon tea! It was the most delicious thing ever, and I think I had at least three servings. The food, proficient service and of course the tea definitely made up for the wait and I recommend it.

Hands down... they have the best shrimp and grits!!!!! I used to think that the grits from Guerilla Cafe was the best, but when I ordered this.. omg.. it's like eating loaded mash potatoes but with so many flavors! The wait obviously was long. My friend and I waited for a good one hour before we got seated. Luckily, we went to Tartine Bakery to get some yummy morning buns, otherwise we would have starved. The sweet watermelon ice tea is bit too sweet for my taste. I'd like it more if the sweetness was water-downed a bit and maybe add more watermelon in there. The crawfish beignets were yummy! It's like a savory southern donut. I wish there was more filling and less dough though.

Deeeelicious! I've only been once so far, but boy did Brenda's deliver! We lucked out, got there before the huge rush, and only waited for about 10-15 minutes for a table to open on a weekday for lunch. Bring change for the meter, if you drive! The food was phenomenally good. I had one of the specials that day - chicken étouffée. I would have been more pleased (and given 5 stars) if it had actually been crawfish or at least shrimp étouffée, but it was still the tastiest I've had since I lived in the South. My date had a Po-boy, though I can't seem to remember which one. It was yummy too. And we shared a plate of beignets which were good, but nothing more than your average, delectable fried dough. ;) It's a bit out of my way, and the wait makes it less attractive, but it's well worth the occasional adventure or special treat!

This is the best brunch food I've ever had. Unfortunately, there's always a very long wait (on the street) to get in. Plan to go get some coffee after you sign in. It's a nice cozy-but-casual atmosphere inside. You might need to scope it out before trying to bring a large group, since seating is limited. I recommend trying the Crawfish Beignets.

Brenda's is a wonderful little restaurant that specializes in beignets and breakfast foods with a Cajun/Creole influence. Servings are large and flavorful with prices averaging about $15-20 a person for drinks, beignets, and a main dish. The Good The food is well prepared and presentation is nice. There are a variety of breakfast/brunch dishes with many different styles of prepared eggs. I ordered the eggs Benedict with fried chicken and was not disappointed. Their sampler plate of beignets ranged from savory to very sweet. Once seated service was efficient, attentive, and friendly. The interior of the restaurant is attractive with an apparently recent remodel. The Bad For its popularity, the place is an order of magnitude too small. Our wait was 90 minutes to be seated. A cutesy but somewhat anxiety producing chalkboard wall is used to track waiting patrons. Many restaurants seem to employ this approach of building purposefully small restaurants to cause a long queue. Bottom Line I recommend this place to anyone who loves breakfast/brunch places but be prepared for very long wait times unless you show up first thing when they open.

Woke up today and decided to make the Sunday Brunch.  In terms of the food, FANTASTIC.  I had the beignets and the catfish eggs benedict.  The only criticism I have is for the poached eggs, which I agree with another yelper need to be a little runnier.  The hollandaise was perfect and the breading on the catfish had a great spicy flavor.  I also really liked the crawfish beignet, and surprise I loved the watermellon iced tea which seems to be pretty popular.  Also amazing prices, the benedict was $11 and the coffee was $2.50. Just dont get there at 11 am on Sunday when it is beautiful and sunny out, we had an hour and a half wait to get a table.  Food was definitely worth it but I would rather go on a rainy day in order to avoid this next time.

I honestly don't know what the big deal is about this place.  Came here on Sunday with some friends and waited almost 2 hrs! The host was really sweet and asked if we'd like coffee or biscuits while we waited.   We were determined to try it out and see what all the fuss was about.  What we ordered: -Hangtown fry - eggs benedict w/ fried chicken - eggs benedict w/ fried catfish - Some beef stew scramble dish that looked like Chili - flight of beignets -watermelon iced tea The beignets were heavy and way too doughy/dense.  The watermelon iced tea was gross.  The biscuits were Ok... too buttery on the outside and dry on the inside...weird.  The entrees themselves were ok, nothing spectacular or better than other mom & pop places.  The only redeeming quality was the service, very attentive (from the host to the bus boy). Overall I'd only recommend this place to someone who wants to see and be seen during brunch.  Otherwise, it's a NO for me.

We escaped the heavy San Francisco rain one morning and took refuge in Brenda's, an adorable, albeit very tiny, cafe serving up some serious soul food. If you come here for one reason, and one reason only, make it the beignets. And NOT just one: get the Flight. The Crawfish is especially delicious. Husband enjoyed his Egg & Bacon Tartine (bacon, egg, gruyere and tomato relish on a french roll). Service can definitely do with some improving, at least in our experience. I'd return promptly and happily for more beignets!

Good food, most definitely. 2 biggest minuses each time I visit, wait is seemingly  interminable and the worst part : service is rushed. I feel like I just sat down and a few minutes after food gets served, someone is already hovering. MUST TRY ITEMS IF YOU HAVE TIME TO BURN: CHOCOLATE BEIGNETS, EGGS BENEDICT

One of the best places to have breakfast in SF. Definitely try the beignet flight and also ask for recommendations on what to have. Probably good to share whatever you order so you can taste both the sweet and savory items.  Service is great and would return. Bring quarters as you'll have to feed the meter.

The BFC was not bad . The fried chicken and fries were pretty good except the chicken was a little bit on the dry side . The biscuit tasted alright but it was way too big . The coleslaw was too dry and it lacked flavor . Their watermelon pickles tasted weird ... it was salty and sour and had some kind of strange twist of flavor to it . The gumbo was okay except that it wasn't spicy . The watermelon iced tea was okay but I didn't really see anything special about it .

I'd really like to give Brenda's 3 stars, but it just doesn't feel justified. I'll break it down for you. LOVE the Beignets. Tried the flight on my first trip, and went back a second time for the plain and chocolate beignets. Dislike the service. Both trips I had mediocre to poor service-- waitress forgetting my order, receiving the wrong food, forgotten drinks, and an overall 'I don't give a sh*t' attitude. This is where it hurts. I ordered too much food and had to take some home, packaged up in a to-go box, inside a plastic bag. I get home and put the food in the fridge, coming back to it a couple hours later. I open it up to find a COCKROACH nestled up in the biscuit! I know this cockroach didn't crawl in from my fridge into my to-go box. It must have crawled in when they were packing up my food. Whatever the case, I'm scarred and won't be returning.

It breaks my heart to update this review. I went in for brunch with a friend yesterday, and we had horrible service. First of all, after taking our order, our server never came back to check on our table. The biggest issue though was after waiting for our two dishes to come out, which I would normally forgive cause the food is so delicious, one of the dishes came out completely cold. Since our waitress never came back to check on us, we had no way to give her the feedback, and when we paid our bill and told someone their response was - oh, sorry. Really? That's it? It's one thing if we were with a huge party and they had issues with the timing, but when you literally only order two plates, it's confusing how that could happen. Brenda's, I still love you, but you have been put on notice. Pull it together, or risk losing one of your biggest fans.

YUM YUM YUM! One of my besties told me about this place and knew it was a must try! The three of us walked in on a sprinkly gloomy day, but that didn't stop us, why? Because there was no line! The interior design of this restaurant consisted of 4 skylights that lit up the room as if we were outside. We couldn't stop taking pictures! We sat down to a double sided menu, but only glanced through the breakfast. The waiter mentioned that the lunch menu was also available and insisted that we can't go wrong with ANYTHING. He recommended, so we ordered: - sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce - DELICIOUS! I've never had pancakes without syrup before, and this combo definitely was not missing it! - french toast - the cinnamon and powdered sugar gave this a little crunch. It came with 6 triangle cuts and syrupp - oyster omelette (this wasn't the actual name of it, it is one of their house specials though) but it was SOO BOMBB. It came with potatoes and biscuit. When it came, it seemed little, but we were all soooo full and worth the price!!! We took the leftovers to go and also ordered a chocolate beignet - OH MY GOD. If you love semi-sweet chocolate inside a donut, you MUST MUST MUST order this!!!

The big portion appetizer of crawfish beignet, well-flavored BFC fried chicken plus its surprisingly good hot pepper jelly, and right-sweeted watermelon iced tea merit this place outstanding. Cramped space (I could hear the whispered conversation from the next table) and no refill on the watermelon iced tea unless you ask, however, give them one star less in my book.

My friend and I came here at about 8am to grab some breakfast, persuaded to go by a couple who insisted Brenda's was the best breakfast food in the city. We ordered a plate of plain beignets to share and each ordered eggs and sausage plates for ourselves.  The beignets came out fresh and hot, the powdered sugar making every bite more and more delicious.  They were amazing. And then the eggs and sausage.  My plate came out just as I had ordered it.  The eggs were great and the sausage delicious.  The potatoes were a little bland.  But the real problem was my friend's order.  Her over medium eggs were brown around the edges and completely cooked through.  They also forgot the sausage on her plate, and when we told the waitress her order was wrong, she was completely confused and it took her an extra 8 minutes to get the sausages to our table.   Then it took 20 minutes to flag down a waitress to get our check.   Good beignets but BAD service.

I literally have dreams about tongue punching the hot beignets they serve here (Cafe Du Mound eat your powder-sugar covered heart out), chocolate, apple and crayfish filled it doesn't matter-- I'll take them all on and they won't stand a chance! So far I've tried 3 different dishes here for breakfast and they were all just amazing. Thank you for proving me wrong about French Soul Food, If only the restaurants in New Orleans could learn to cook the way Brenda's does. I am going to stop my praises here, because this place really doesn't need anymore people waiting in line to get in.

Pretty good.  I'm from Louisiana so I was a bit skeptical about French Soul Food.  I've been to a lot of "New Orleans" style places that rarely live up to the name.  Brenda's I think passes the test though.  There are some interesting menu items but nothing to pee your pants over.  Except the beignets. I 've tried several dishes but the stuffed beignets are the only thing I would recommend.  They are a bit thicker than a traditional beignet but it needs to be to hold up to all that stuffing.  All 3 versions(shrimp, apple, crawfish) are fantastic.  Don't go here without trying the beignet flight.  Not a fan of the watermelon iced tea.  It is different though, I'll give it that.  I'll just stick to mimosas.  Like most SF breakfast joints be prepared for a long wait (with the obligatory bum looking for cigarette butts).

I've been waiting to eat here for some time now and I was not disappointed at all.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I wasn't even sure what a beignet was but my brother recommended it so we ordered the crawfish beignets.  Wow!  Right then I knew I was going to enjoy my breakfast.  I had the fried catfish eggs benedict.  Instead of it being served on an english muffin, it's served on a biscuit.  Stupid good.  I was full but had to keep eating away at it.  My wife had the pork belly with cheddar grits.  She couldn't finish it so my brother and I had no problem finishing it.   Everything was really good, I can't wait to eat here again. My brother said they remodeled the place since the last time he was there and there was more room.  We came on a Sunday and any good breakfast/brunch place on a Sunday is going to be busy so we expected a wait.  The food here is awesome so I wouldn't be surprised if there's always a wait.  The service was good, they were busy but we didn't wait long for our food and everyone was nice.  Looking forward to the day we can eat here again.

I have eaten at Brenda's now 10+ times for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and now dinner, and I can honestly say it's never disappointed (except for the one time I had horrible service.. more on that later). The wait is long if you come on the weekends, no doubt, but the food is more than worth it. And if you come on a weekday or for dinner, there usually is little to no wait. For all-day: I would recommend the crawfish beignet. Granted, it's a bit saltier than what I usually like, it's still delicious. I love the cayenne pepper on top, and the way the filling spills out of the dough, still piping hot with steam. For brunch: Try the bennies. I'm a fan of the catfish, though the chicken ones are pretty good too. And it's plated on Brenda's delicious biscuits, which are always the perfect level of softness (I hate it when I have to saw through my benedicts!) And the hollandaise is fantastic here. Grits are divine (warning: butter overload, but in the best way possible). For lunch/dinner: BFC is great if you're a fan of fried chicken (and who isn't). 3 HUGE pieces of chicken with cole slaw and fries (which were a bit soggy, my only criticism!). I've also had the catfish po'boy, which is drizzled with this chipotle remoulade sauce that's to die for. Overall, great place, and the service has been great recently! Super friendly staff... I did have one horrific experience (mentioned above) about a year ago where this lady called out my name once, then erased my spot because I didn't have a fast response. I let it go the first time, but when it happened again 45 minutes later, I went up to her literally a minute after the fact  to see if we could get seated anyway. She said no, put our name at the bottom of the list (an hour wait), gave a lot of attitude, and finally when I asked to see the manager, she seated us. Then, she resorted to giving us the stink eye the entire time while chatting to her coworkers. I don't think she still works there, as I haven't seen her in ages... so my 5 stars are banking on the fact that she's gone.

Dear Brenda - whoever and wherever you may be. I want to thank you from the bottom of my fat little heart and soul for the amazing meal we shamelessly devoured on my birthday. Brenda, dear, your bignets are something out of a fat girl's dreams, a fairytale - after biting into you crawfish bignet I wanted to crawl in it and die a happy girl. Then came the chocolate and apples ones, just making me want to die in them once more. Your shrimp/caramelized onion/goat cheese omelet almost brought me to tears, I felt as if Buddha or Jesus or Allah made it with their holy hands just for me. Now, Brenda, your grits and your buttermilk buscuits, something out of a storybook. Simply perfect. Althought I could barely breathe I managed to inhale my buscuit while covering it in your home made strawberry jam, as it would be a sin to leave it untouched. Thank you Brenda, for allowing me to experience the most incredible gluttony I've ever known. PS: Get there early, I got there @ 7:45 and there was already one person waiting. By 8:05 there was a wait, which I can now say would be so worth it.

Food 4/5.  Atmosphere 4/5.  Service 3.5/5.  It was very good. Worth the wait.  Very popular, expect a wait.  Prices reasonable - $10 - 14 for most.  The beignets looked very good, but we were too full.  We were going to get the chocolate ones for dessert.  We had the shrimp and grits and cream cheese French toast with blueberries (daily special).

Love love love the food at this place:  The Crawfish Beignet was so fluffy and delicious, a perfect starter!  The Onion Soup Grantinee has a really condensed flavor, but the gruyere crouton is a little too filling to my liking.  I love the Catfish des Allemands - the fillet was perfectly seared and the crawfish étouffée was irresistable!  My boyfriend was not thrilled by the fried chicken.  I'm looking forward to go back and try their breakfast that all the reviewers talked about :)

Went here this morning Started with the flight ( 1 of each beignet's) There were two of us a split everything in half. My favorites were the apple beignet and crawfish. I had the Veggie omelet it was excellent, and also a watermelon tea. I just had to have it , ( I have a slight allergy to all melons ) but I took my benadryl and it was wortht it. Much better than Mama's in washington square and not as long of a wait.

Found this place around 12 on a Sunday afternoon.  Decided to take my wife out, but as everyone on yelp mentioned.. This place was busy!  It's a very small restaurant, and every seat was filled.  There were roughly 15-20 people waiting outside before us.  At first we thought about staying, but decided to go after our hungry belly's began to talk. My wife and I decided to pull yelp up on our mobiles and move on to the next top rated breakfast spot.  We first decided on ordering some Beignets togo.  I walked inside, and ask the waitress who greeted me at the door if they did togo orders and she said yes.  I order the sample plate of Beignets and a order of plain Beignets.  Paid $12, and they we ready in less than 15 minutes. The Beignets were a little chewy and very sweet.. The sugar hit my vains faster then a double shot expresso! Really wanted to stay because the plates looked hearty, and inside the food smelled delicious.  Next time we'll arrive earlier in the morning. One thing I did notice when I walked in was that the floor was slippery, not slippery wett, but greasy slippery. The reason for the three is: Wait was too long. Had to wait outside. Neighborhood ( lots of homeless, and questionable characters larking, and the smell of urine mixed with the smell of KFC next door ) The Beignets were good, but wanted a whole breakfast. Floors were slippery, gave the impression of a greasy spoon hole in the wall joint. Would advise against large parties! *We will go back to try other items on the menu.

The beignets are too doughy and not airey enough.  I will give you that.  And the wait is excessive, although made much easier by a beautiful day and some friends.  We were a party of 3 and we waited an hour and fifteen minutes.  Parties of 2 looked like they were clocking between a half hour and an hour. However, they serve the butteriest most wonderful grits I've had anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line.  Some of the people I grew up with were real southerners and gave me a sense of proper grits, and the key is large amounts of butter, and plenty of salt.  Catfish eggs benedict was the best meal on our table (and it was in front of me and my grits).  Very friendly server that even apologized for the wait.  Yum!

This place was so good, I had to write a review (my 2nd one so far).  My brother and I went for breakfast on a Friday at about 10am and it was packed.  Luckily, we were able to squeeze in at the bar.  Here is what we ordered: 1.  Beignet sampler, which included 1 crawfish, 1 chocolate, 1 apple, and 1 plain.  The crawfish beignet was by far the best, like nothing I've ever had.  It was sooo good, filled with cheesy crawfish goodness...I wished we just got a full order of the crawfish beignets.  The others were just ok. 2.  I ordered the grillades and grits.  It came with the softest, most buttery biscuit I've ever had.  I had never had grillades and grits before, but I can't imagine it tasting any better than what I had at Brenda's - the grits were perfect and the gravy was really tasty.  The beef was a little tough though.  All in all, I was in creole food heaven. 3.  My brother ordered the fry oyster and bacon scramble, which came with the best breakfast potatoes ever, and a biscuit.  My brother scarfed down everything on his plate.   I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, which I had with a cafe au lait (perfectly hot and flavorful).  I would highly recommend this place for breakfast.  The only negative while I was there was the cramped eating quarters.   FYI - When we left the restaurant, there was a huge line out the door.

Wow, my new favorite breakfast place and all due to Yelp! My husband and I wanted to get brunch before going to the nearby Asian Art Museum and I found Brenda's on Yelp. We almost didn't wait because it was about 45 minutes and we were already starving after coming over all the way from oakland (such a long trip, I know). But then we thought better of doing a breakfast hunt while hungry and borderline cranky. I am so glad we waited. We sat at the bar along one side of the (tiny) restaurant and it was squished. I got plain coffee but one sip and I realized I wanted the cafe au lait of the woman next to me. I asked if I could make the change and the waiter did it with no problem. Really great coffee for an au lait. We got the granny smith apple beignets and decided next time we would get the plain beignets and one breakfast to share as, like a previous reviewer, I was pretty full after the beignet course. Also, they were pretty heavy on the nutmeg of which I am not a big fan. I got scrambled eggs (not a huge egg fan but I love everything that comes with them), molasses glazed ham (amazingly amazing!), grits (great! I think there is a bit of cheese in them, so delicious!) and a biscuit per the recommendation of the waiter. The biscuit was phenomenal. I think I make very good biscuits myself but this was way better. Nice ambiance, great food. One warning: do not leave the front of the outside of the restaurant while you wait. I saw the waiter crossing off people's names from the list if he called while they were getting coffee. You snooze you lose at Brenda's.

Long lines are worth it. We stood out in the rain, eyeing the biscuits and beignets through the window, and they did not disappoint.  I ordered the gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelette, and it was amazing. Plenty of cheese and a tomato-bacon relish, so it was rich, but still somehow not over-the-top heavy. I don't eat much wheat because I have an allergy, but I will continue to make an exception for Brenda's biscuits. It's a tiny spot, which feels a little more uncomfortable than cozy, but the food has more than enough flavor to make up for it. I may need to come here every weekend.

Only a short 10-minute walk from campus (Art Institute of California - San Francisco), Brenda's French Soul Food restaurant brings the taste of the New Orleans' French Quarter to mouths in San Francisco's Tenderloin district.  This breakfast/lunch spot on Polk Street is a blend of Creole and Southern style cooking.  The "nothing is over $10" philosophy, Brenda's is an economical choice with great food and service. If going during lunchtime, I recommend going as early or as late as possible to avoid the lunchtime rush.  Everyday posts daily blackboard specials.  The Sausage and Shrimp Jambalaya ($?) and Red Beans and Rice ($?) are few of the daily specials.   On the regular menu, try the Fried Shrimp or Fried Oyster Po-boys, served with a chipotle rémoulade on a toasted French roll ($9.25). For vegetarian and vegan customers, Brenda's offers a Vegan Josephine ($8).  Its sloppy joe seasoning mixed in with tofu, toasted on a Kaiser roll. All sandwich dishes are served with bread-and butter pickle chips, plus a choice of French fries or cole slaw. The Sweet Watermelon Tea ($2.25) is a house specialty, fresh-made daily with real watermelon. Overall, if you can't fork out the money to fly to the Big Easy, Brenda's French Soul Food is a great alternative.

Waited about 25 minutes in the rain. Sketchy crowd that walks the streets in this part of San Francisco but essentially harmless. Had the Crawdad Beignets and they were to die for. Crunchy on the outside and sweet creamy and tasty on the inside. I was truly surprised by the taste and the amount of crawdads inside. Watermelon Tea is the best, just needed a little Vodka. Had the sausage gumbo, 930 am and it was nice and last was the egg dish with bacon and oysters, Nice taste the eggs were just a tad over done for my taste.

Fried catfish po' boy= Yummmazing. Beignets= best I've had this far West. Famed Watermelon Icedtea= notsomuch. (a little bitter & too much rhind flavor! maybe it was a bad batch.) atmosphere = quaint, tiny, totally adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a 2-4top kinda place. i don't know HOW they could accommodate a larger party in there. servers were friendly even though it was super busy lunch rush. we were lucky enough to get a real table, and it was quite nice. dining at the mirrored bar could be kinda awkward, though. especially if you're on a lunch date with someone you don't know too well... we will definitely be back! hooray for Brenda's! It's delish!

I decided to try this place because of all the raves about this restaurant.  I tried crawfish beignets, Andouille and Cheddar Omelette and chicory coffee. I was so disappointed in all three. The beignets were freshly cooked, but hard as if they had been cooked days ago. Not tasty at all. The chicory coffee was just bitter, even with lots of cream/milk. The omelette was not bad, but plain, nothing special. I have had better omelettes at a better or similar price. I guess I expected too much. It was quite a trip for me to get there, but the foods were just not worth the time and the money. Honestly, I don't understand why people are crazy about this place.

Friendly staff and that's about where it ends for me.   After reading all of the reviews I felt it was my duty to get to this place and check it out.  I had high expectations. My bf and I waited for an hour and a half to get seated.  The place is tiny and quaint, which we liked.  However the wait was exhausting. My bf ordered the pork chops, they were fatty and nothing special.  I ordered the hangtown fry scramble, yuck!  However, the grits were very nicely cooked (creamy and hot) and the biscuits were also nice. Of course we had to try the watermelon ice tea.....it was ok, but the watermelon juice at most any mexican market is 10 times better.  All in all I've had much better.  To tell the truth if this is all it takes to have a successful restaurant in the Bay Area, I need to open one and quick! I will most likey try this place again, but only if in the neighborhood and the wait is less than 30 minutes.

Its aiiiiight. Think alot of it is hype. So far i only like the Grillades and Grits (Beef cutlets braised in spicy Creole gravy served over grits, with two eggs & very moist biscuit) And plain beignet. The crawfish would be so good if it wasnt so salty. I do want to try the french toast next time. The egg and bacon tartine is not very exciting and the tomato-bacon relish is way to sweet for my liking. Nothing memorable about Sloppy Josephine and Poboy Shrimp and wasnt worth taking home. Its a busy fast paced cozy environment and hard to get a table. Service is good. Would maybe go back

First time at Brenda's for Saturday brunch.  There seems to always be a wait, but it is worth it! The beignets are yummers and the watermelon iced tea is delish!

Oh look, another review. Brenda's was great. the food and service were stellar. We got there before they opened on a Sunday morning and had no wait for a table. The beignet flight was awesome (all four types). the special catfish benedict was delicious (a bit skimpy on the fish though), as was the french toast. They could offer a choice of coffee, because the chicory coffee was unpleasant. Can't wait to go back and we are excited to hear they are expanding.

Not sure why I waited so long to try this place... Amazing biscuits!  The wait looked a bit long but we were happy to sit at the counter and were seated in a few minutes.

Well worth the wait, so get there early.  Now, you've been tipped off. There is a reason why there is a line for the best grub in the Loin.  Actually suggest this to friends to have brunch tomorrow and we're making it happen.  I love having folks try new places and see how it rawks their palate.  As a foodie and loving what is available in SF, this is definitely a place you need to stop by and get some.   Aiight!

Me and the bf went to Brenda's on a Sunday at 10am about three weeks ago. When we get there I write my name down on the little notepad that they have hanging, there were about 15 other names in front of ours. Oh my, the wait begins.. Everytime someone's name was called it felt like that person had won the lottery or something.. We are finally called in at about 11:50pm. After that long wait and all those people waiting outside and all of the hype I've heard about the place, I was expecting great food. I was expecting delicious food that melts in my mouth, you know, the type of food that makes you think that you are in food heaven and that no other food would ever compare. I had the fried oysters omelette, a coffee and the beignets. The servings were huge, I was starving but couldn't even finish it all, but my dish lacked flavor. I had to add of hot sauce to my omelette and potatoes to give it the flavor soul food is supposed to have. My favorite thing was the biscuit and the strawberry (?) jam. But until they move to a different location that accommodates more patrons, I am not willing to wait that long for okay food. On a positive note, once you get inside the place is cute, very homey, and the jam was delicious!

Cons? It's teensy weensy, which means just about no elbow room - and a guaranteed wait. But the wait is definitely worth it. They really feed you here {no punk portions in this place!}, and every huge serving you'll find on the plate in front of you is delicious. I loved my coffee, my French Toast with Butter Pecan Sauce - oh my gosh, did I ever enjoy that! - and my friend's beignets. She had some kind of Andouille Omelet with the potatoes and a biscuit and sang its praises, too. Will definitely be back, and next time, I'm bringing my food-loving, biscuit-eating husband along!

My girlfriend turned me onto this place. Great place to just grab some breakfast and chill. Enjoyed the music and the staff is really cool. Started out with a chocolate Beignet, which was satisfactory. I had the Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette and it was delicious. Went with the Grits on the side and was not disappointed. Had a sip of the Watermelon Iced Tea and was not that impressed.

Wear your fat-kid clothes folks!  It's extremely difficult to not clean your plate here. There are few tables so I would not advise going with a group larger than four. My mouth waters just thinking about eating here.   -The grits- EXCELLENT!   -Bingets....... eat them all.  Do yourself a favor and get the flight.  I don't have a favorite, they are all amazing in their own right. -Eggs Benedict.... perfectly poached and creole hollandaise sauce= HEAVEN!!!! -Shrimp and grits........ deadly and worth the pain you feel from consuming the entire bowl -Stuffed French toast... like everything else on the menu it totally rocks.  The batter is just sweet enough that you don't need syrup but lets get serious, what's another tablespoon of goodness going to hurt at this point? I could continue to go on but then I would need to leave work right now and go eat. Basically- get brunch at Brenda's and know you will have to wear sweatpants.

I had lunch here today and it was as awesome as ever: the andouille and cheddar omelet, with potatoes and a biscuit. The biscuits keep me coming back.  Big, round, southern style biscuits, crunchy on the sides.  There is a pot of jam on each table for them, sometimes peach and sometimes strawberry.  There is chicory coffee, and New Orleansy music (like Fats Domino).  I've had a few other things here like the hangtown fry and the beignets, but I keep coming back to that omelet with piquant sauce all over it.  And the biscuit. This place is very small and gets crowded fast, so be patient, it's worth the wait.

A definite 5 star for me. Let me just list what his place has (and they do it well)... - creole shrimp and grits - homemade whole wheat biscuits - watermelon iced tea - new orleans' style beignets Brought my family from N. Florida (in other words, southerns) here during a visit to SF, and they all loved it. Great atmosphere inside, with Brenda in the kitchen cooking all of our food herself. A great find! Oh, and we showed up early with a large group of 7 and sat down right away.

Wooohooo indeed! I am a regular visitor to the bay area on account of family... San Francisco is blessed with deliciousness and variety of food only rivaled by NYC (alas not the case in DC)... My breakfast spot on my visits has always been Kate's, but this time around my sister brought me to Brenda's. Love at first sight! Great NOLA style jazz welcomes you into this quaint little establishment that seats about 30 or so people. However, whats even more inviting is the savory and sweet smells of seriously good food! The beignets are simply phenomenal and the grits offered a taste of real southern cooking! I highly recommend you scope this gem out whenever your travels take you to the tenderloin!

Brenda's has the perfect drink on a nice warm sunny day and its their homemade sweetened Watermelon Iced Tea!! The wait wasn't as bad as i thought we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The main reason i came to eat at Brenda's were for their beignets! i recommend getting the beignet sampler $8.00 (you get one of each flavor; Chocolate,Crayfish,Apple, and Original). Another plus to Brenda's is that prices are reasonable for the QUALITY of the food. The only problem i had when going to Brenda's is PARKING! All i have to say is that $3.00 an hour for a 1 hour limit meter was well worth it and i still had 5 more minutes on the meter! Will definitely come back to grub at this spot!

Visited San Fran as a tourist for the first time a few weeks ago, and based on other Yelp reviews, knew I had to visit Brenda's.  My boyfriend and I went on a Friday mid-morning, and waited 10-15 minutes for a table.  The specials were posted on a board outside, so before I even went in, I knew I what I wanted to order: SHRIMP & GRITS.  Sounds amazing, right? But before that, we wanted to try Brenda's famous beignets, so we ordered the sampler.  These things are HUGE!  I thought we'd be getting little bite-sized pieces, but this was definitely 4 full-size beignets- chocolate, apple, plain, and crayfish (or is it crawfish?).  These were so delicious, and we definitely should not have eaten as many as we did (3 out of the 4).  Definitely addictive. So back to the shrimp & grits- this was one of the most rich, decadent dishes that I've ever eaten.  Creamy grits, under a thick layer of cheese, under jumbo shrimp with tomato relish.  So yummy, but it was a HUGE portion (plus I had eaten those beignets) and I could not finish it.  My boyfriend got the oyster omelette- which was also a massive portion and quite delicious.  This came with a side of grits, and a biscuit.... which looked tasty, but unfortunately went untouched. Service was quick and friendly, even though they were busy busy busy.  All in all, this place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to residents and tourists alike.  I can't wait to go back to San Francisco, and to Brenda's.

I am obviously not alone in my love for Brenda's but I thought I would throw in my 2 cents anyway! This has to be one of my favorite breakfast places. The biscuits are melt in your mouth aMAZING! Although there has not been anything here I didn't like. My handsome man had the pulled pork sweet potato hash last time we were here and it was delicious and very unique, I love that is was something you can't get any old breakfast place. What really impresses me here though is the service. This is the type of place that could have service staff that knows how great their food is and make you think you should be honored just to dine there, but they are warm and friendly and attentive. They know you have probably been waiting outside for a while and are sure to great you with hot coffee as soon as you sit down. I will be back time and time again!

My friends and I are Brenda's fanatics! We are always on the quest to convert others to our foodie ways. Now Brenda's is small, packed, loud, and in the oh-so-colorful Tenderloin, and if you actually want to eat in the restaurant you will have to wait (a while) but OH MY FLUFFY BUNNIES is it worth all of that! Having spent some of my formative years in the south this food brings back some nice memories and wonderful flavors. My friends and I have managed to sample almost the entire menu and this is what I have to say: Thou shalt not miss the beignets. Thou shalt not worry about ones cholesterol intake. Thou shalt sample of the grillades and grits, pumpkin pancakes, and tartine. Thou shalt drink of the watermelon sweet tea. and Thou shalt walk away with a food baby that will last the rest of the day. My one caveat is that for purists like me the sweet tea is NOT sweet enough, but still very refreshing. I am also told that the gumbo is delish but I can't do spicy (I suffer for my crawfish beignet) so I take their word on it. I say: hells yea!

People raved about Brenda's food so I had to go and check it out.  The first time I arrived around 10:00am on a Saturday.  The line was out the door.  FORGET IT! Months past and I decided to give it another try because I really wanted to taste their beignets.  We arrived at this joint close to 10:30am. When you first arrive you must sign your name in. We waited for almost 2 hours before we were seated for brunch.  Probably, even longer if I didn't notice the waitress skipped our names on the list.  WTF?!?!?  Not even an apology (-1star). Once seated, we were cramped up soo close to strangers that I felt claustrophobic.  Who the hell wants to rub elbows with complete strangers while dining?  The place was super loud. We ordered: Flight of beignets (chocolate, plain, crawfish, and apple).  Chocolate was good, plain and apple was ok.  Nothing memorable.  However, the crawfish beignets were sooo freaking delectable I had to order another round. Watermelon ice tea (refreshing and not too sweet) Eggs benedict with grits (tasty but can do without the grits). Will I come back again?  Maybe.  Depends if I'm craving for crawfish beignets and if I want to hold a shouting competition in a box.

The first time I went to Brenda's, I ordered an oyster po'boy which was really delicious, and had a good balance of seafood with sauce on a toasty roll.  Though it tasted great, I think the oysters were bad because I had food poisoning for the rest of the day. Even with that minor traumatic experience, I thought the food tasted so good, that I had to go back, and just risk food poisoning again.  I'm glad I did, because this restaurant has so much deliciousness to offer!  The grits are great, the bignets are light and tasty, and their biscuits are to die for.  Don't forget to try their home-made jam! This place would get five stars if it wasn't for the unfortunately tainted oysters.

Really cute place with excellent ambiance. Cramped but in a good way. It's the kind of cramped that one loves to feel while at a horror movie. Now, on to the coffee. The coffee was called "community coffee and chicory," which was rich and full bodied in taste but made me less wired than decaf. Food. The best biscuit I've ever had in my life. It was buttery, warm, moist and rich. Yummy! First time I had grits. I think they were corn grits. I liked the dish but it was overwhelmingly flavored with butter. Needed salt for sure.  I had an andouille sausage and cheddar omelette. I took about three bites and left it alone to focus on my biscuit and fruit cup. I was disappointed in the omelette. I really wanted it to be good but it was dry and flavorless. The egg was tough, too. What I saw others order and I wish I had room for: beignets. Three stars because it was fine. It wasn't awful food, but it also wasn't amazing. For some reason it crowds up quickly so be prepared to wait or else get there right at 8.

LOVE the food at this place!  I have been here a few times, and have really loved almost everything I've ordered.  The only thing I didn't love was the flight of beignets.  My favorite was the crawfish beignet, so next time, I may just order one of those instead of the whole flight.  Worth a try though! I've also had the catfish eggs benedict (my favorite) and the sweet potato pancakes.  I'm definitely a savory breakfast kind of person, so the benedict won me over.  Especially when the eggs are served atop a huge, fresh biscuit with buttery cheesy grits on the side.  I salivate and dream over it to this day. It's a popular place and you can expect to wait....and wait and wait.  The first time I went here, my sister and I put our names on the list and waited for an hour for our name to be called.  After said hour, a couple who arrived AFTER us (as evident by their names being below ours) got called in first!  We told the waitress about her mistake and whew...major attitude.  I understand it's busy, but please, acknowledge that you messed up and treat your customers with respect!  If it weren't for the attitude I would give it 5 stars.

My friend and I went here on a week day and there was still at least an hour and a half wait, so make sure you bring quarters for the meter. The food was great and the watermelon iced tea did not let us down.  Definitely get the beignet flight to share or you will be looking around at everyone else's wishing you had!  The shrimp po'boy was really good, not over breaded and the cole slaw it came with was surprisingly good.  My friend's omlette was great (honestly I wished I'd gotten the omlette) but the best part was the biscuits.  Growing up in northern California my experience with biscuits is, granted, not very extensive, but that biscuit made me want to be southern like nothing ever had before.  I'm pretty sure we spent the entire meal congratulating ourselves for waiting out the line, because BOY was it worth it!

I live around the corner-ish & decided to eat at Brenda's on a Thursday afternoon around 12:30. A little bit of a wait, 10 minutes tops, but the host offered me coffee while I waited. I had the the po'boy special, which was pulled pork. Pretty damn good & worth the calories I rarely eat at lunch. The bun it was on was toasted perfectly & managed to be, um, toasty even under all that pork. The pork was tender & flavorful. The sauce complimented it well. Whatever with the tomatoes, it's not tomato season, I hope when it is they're better. My fries were hot, crisp & salted perfectly. The watermelon ice tea definitely had a watermelon taste to it but I just don't like sweet tea. Still I had one and half glasses of it. All different kinds of folks were eating at Brenda's & all seem to be enjoying their food. When I looked around while trying to figure out what to order all the food looked delicious. I would go back & bring a friend along next time. Brunch sounds like it could be the thing but I'm just not one to wait that long.

I think this place is a bit overrated, but that's not to say the food is not good. I tried beignets for the first time at this place, and they were amazing! I had the grillades and gritts and my boyfriend got the hangtown fry. I think my option was a bit too early for brunch, and I could only finish half of it. It was good, but it was impossible to finish all that beef and eggs imagine the cholesterol! My boyfriend's food was good, but the whole oyster scramble was a bit too rich to eat all at once. The service was friendly and the wait was long, but I would say it's worth a try at least once. I also have concluded that "soul food" is not the best option for my breakfast.

A-MAZING! This place was fantastic! My friend Che' and I ate here last night and were both really impressed. The selection of food all sounds really tempting and it was all pretty sot-on. We started with oysters in the half shell. We got 1 of each, 3 different types, and they were HUGE! They were all yummy. My favorite was certainly the one with bacon. UGH!! SO GOOD! I had the burger, w/ goat cheese, and fries. The burger was DEF. 5/5 stars! The French fries were not really my favorite by any means though. They were a bit too moist/soggy for my taste. They weren't duper greasy or anything. The fries just lacked any crunch. L My frienc had the shrip grotten (SP?) She loved it. I liked it. The great thing was that it's made with goat cheese and therefore, my friend could eat it! No cow cheese for her. L The for dessert we got the three bignetts (SP?) and took them home for later. They turned out to be ok. They were a bit too bready for my taste. But te chocolate in the middle was still very good. I wouldn't order them again, but I thought they were alright. The best part ws that ALL this amazing food, only cost us $44. When we split it, and tipped, it was like $27 each. Which, for what we got, is a GREAT deal! I'm telling friends aobut this place. I'll def be returning!

3.5 stars (see the reasons for the minus 1.5 stars below). A truly delicious find in the Tenderloin District. Two of us tried it for brunch on a busy Sunday. I'm from the Bay Area and this was our first time trying Brenda's. Be sure to get there before opening (8am). We arrived 5 or 10min past 8 and ended up being seated at 9:30. If you do arrive late, however, feel free to walk to the Civic Center just a few blocks down Polk Street for some extra exploring. Otherwise, you can grab a cup of coffee from Brenda's *or* venture to Philz Cafe a block or 2 away. Note: They're expanding their restaurant. Should be open in the near future and help alleviate the wait time. Pros (all that should matter: the food): 1. Pork Belly Special -- amazing. Cheesy grits, pork belly, egg. Simply divine. 2. Pumpkin Pancake Special -- THE best pancakes that ever existed. It's got such flavor that it screams "FALL!" and pumpkins. Only thing I would say is it's a bit sweet. 3. Crawfish Beignet -- comes in 3. Delicious. A bit heavy with the fried portion after a whole beignet, so I'd stick to ordering just one dish of this for 2-3 folks. 4. Watermelon Iced Tea -- not bad. An interesting combination of watermelon and...iced tea (self-explanatory). Not too sweet, either. Cons (much of what customers remember: the service): 1. After ordering, they failed to bring us our beignets. Other folks who ordered 10-15min after us started receiving their beignets and meals (we sat waiting for a good 10-15min afterwards, pondering if they would ever bring our food). When we requested that they check if our's was ready, the waitress looked at us funny as if we were making an unreasonable demand, though she later apologized for the long wait with beignets in-hand. 2. Coffee/watermelon iced tea refills. So when 2 people share 2 refill-able drinks, you'd think that there wouldn't be an issue, but no. The two of us unintentionally shared a coffee while waiting the hour plus to get into the restaurant. Once in, we didn't expect them to refill our nearly depleted coffee. So when the waiter came by to refill coffees, we automatically said, "Um, sure, we're sharing one". The waiter stared at us in disdain. We must've been ripping them off on purpose, right? I mean we're sharing a refillable coffee for the price of one. Of course he though that way because when we got our check, he charged us for TWO coffees. Thanks, it was an accident. And thanks for never coming back to refill our coffee again after secretly charging us for two. Also of note is that the same waiter then went around refiling folks' watermelon iced tea post-coffee-sharing debacle. I guess he thought it best to skip our table since we were SHARING a single iced tea (which was never refilled, by the way because he promptly skipped our table). Hilarious. I guess I should have thanked him for not charging us for TWO iced teas. Anyhow, great food but less-than-happy service. It's easy to say just go for the food, but in all honesty, who wants to be in a cruddy mood while enjoying good food? Dear Brenda's staff--please be aware that your customers are people too. Unintentionally sharing a coffee ain't the end of the world, so please don't go making them feel like criminals. It certainly made the meal a bit uncomfortable.

Having heard horror stories about the wait at this place, I turned the corner with apprehension but was greeted with a near-empty chalkboard and nobody waiting outside.  Ordered the beignet flight and the catfish benedict, along with a side of grillade gravy, having starved myself the bulk of the morning in preparation. The plain and apple beignets were a bit disappointing - the outer shell was too thick and doughy, and lacking much flavor.  The apple filling unfortunately resembled that of a McDonald's apple pie.  The gravy was comforting and flavorful, but lacked that cajun kick I was expecting, and also had a strange dirt taste. So why am I giving this a rare 5 stars?  Because everything else blew me away.  The crawfish beignet had a shell that was of a completely different texture than the other more lackluster ones, and was seasoned witha  great cajun spice.  But it was the filling - cheesy, gooey, a full sensory exploration, that did me in.  The hot melted chocolate, also fantastically complemented the beignet in a way that the apple did not. As for the benedict - the catfish was tender and light, despite being deep fried, and hollandaise sauce had a kick that I wasn't expecting.  The grits were superior to anything I'd had in the past (maybe it was all the butter?) - and provided a soothing counterbalance to the salty catfish.  And the biscuit may have been the star - so simple, yet buttery and moist and flavorful in a way I'd never expected a biscuit to be.  I ended up saving it from the flood of hollandaise sauce and egg yolk in order to eat it separately with jam.  Next time I'm most definitely ordering another on the side. Price is comparable to most brunch places in SF.  So when you factor in the uniqueness of the menu and just how damn tasty everything is, it's actually quite a steal.

Crawfish beignets- loOoOoOved it!  Had the shrimp and grits as well- also freakin great.  I will definitely recommend to anyone, just make sure not to be hungry beforehand if your going for brunch- the wait can get pretty long and it's torture to wait in line on an empty stomach.

Dee-lish! We started with the oyster flight (they were all amazing, but i especially like the cayene butter one).  I then had the sweet potato dumplings (I was trying to be healthy, or as healthy as i could with soul food!) and my friend had the shrimp n grits, which I could not stop myself from eating off his plate.  Overall, very tasty, good service, went early so wasn't super busy.  My -1 star is because I think it is a tad overpriced for what you get, but I still will be back, if just for the oysters!

Great food and atmosphere. We waited outside for about 45 minutes for our table but it was a nice day outside and the time flew by. I had the bacon tartine and we shared the beignet flight. It was all delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive

Okay, so the truth is I have never actually eaten any other entree than the friend oyster po' boy here.   It is so good that I get it every time.  It is a good value too.  For $9.75, you get a  large fried oyster sandwich on a toasted french roll with a generous serving of oysters, tomato and lettuce with a chipotle remoulade (be careful, they put A LOT of it on, I ask for it on the side) and a side of fries.  It is awesome!  You get the sweetness of the oysters with the tangy bite of the remoulade.  It is mouth watering.  The only appetizer I have tried is the crayfish beignet and this is good if a bit heavy.  My bf loves the ice tea infused with watermelon but I have no taste for iced tea so I just have to take him at his word. This place is always busy and I have been on many different days and at many different times.  My only advice is come early.  They just completed an extension adding more space and this has made the wait for a table much more tolerable and expedient.

I finally came here after craving it for the last 3 months. I was originally supposed to go to Suppenkuche tonight but dang at Thursday night 7:30 pm, the wait was 1 hour. So S and I went to Brenda's instead. The place had a lot of people but it wasn't packed so we were seated quickly. We started out with the crawfish beignet and their special dungeness crab beignet. Both beignets came out nicely fried with a layer of paprika (?) over it. It definitely wasn't overwhelmingly greasy but it had a nice crunch to it. The crawfish beignet was filled with cheesy nicely seasoned crawfish. However, S and I preferred the dungeness crab beignet which was filled with crab and leeks in a nice creamy sauce. The crab beignet also came with creole mustard, but the condiment wasn't necessary. The crab was sweet and the leeks gave the beignet a good texture. Too bad everyday isn't dungeness crab season. For our entrees, S ordered the kickass meatloaf, another daily special. It came with steamed veggies (green bean, zucchini), mashed potatoes, and "onion jam" (that's what the board said... but it's really caramelized onions). The meatloaf was pretty good, extremely well seasoned. I felt like I was eating BBQ ribs or something because they used similar if not the same spices for the meatloaf. The meatloaf was soft and had good texture, and it definitely wasn't that fatty. I ordered the oyster po'boy. The chipotle remoulade was dripping everywhere! The sandwich was decent, nothing really too special. At least the oysters tasted pretty fresh. Now that I've tried their dinner service, I know that I like Brenda's more for brunch. And... I can definitely eat their beignets everyday! Too bad I was too full for their Ghiradelli chocolate beignet for dessert!

I happened to stumble upon this place because we were starving and wanted something to eat. Little did I know this place was a local favorite place for breakfast. There was a little bit of a wait since it was packed, but the food was absolute delicious. I had the special, which were sweet potato pancakes and my friend had the eggs benedict. So tasty! The beignets were huge and really filling. Great taste, but a serving can be split between two! I will definitely be back here again, possibly for lunch. The breakfast is something to keep in mind for traveling in San Francisco.

Stepping out to Brenda's was much like going on a plane trip. I was so excited to try this place out. I have friends who gave such rave reviews. French / Soul Food, I mean come on what's there not to like? I walk in and my friend has not arrived yet, I sit in the waiting area to kill time. There's a chalkboard that you put your name on and how many are in your party. O my goodness, how fun is that? It's like in grade school when your name was on the board without being in trouble. The host (a flight attendant) was so nice and saw that I was waiting for my friend to join me that he offered to get me something to drink. He was so nice and came over to keep checking up on me to see if my friend had arrived or to refill my glass. My friend showed finally showed up and I was ready for this flight to take off. My friend and I are shown to our table and are given our menus and explained the specials of the evening (flight attendant preparing for take off). So we give our orders and I'm asked if I would like to have a drink to which I reply sweet tea. Now to you southerners out there, what is sweet tea? A little tea, a lot of sugar? YES child YES! So an attendant brings back my "sweet tea" and it's this tea that has a weird taste to it. I ask my friend who has been here before what it was and he said it has watermelon in it. HUH??? I'm sorry did you say watermelon? Why is there watermelon in my tea? They done took this whole southern thing to a whole new level. I didn't ask for it. It's a good thing I'm not allergic to it. I think well hell let's just go with it. Next we are brought some beans. The attendant left them on the table and walked off in a haste. I'm sorry did she say beans? You pick up the beans (in flight peanuts), throw them in your mouth and they're crunchy. My friend informs me that they are deep fried. Is that cinnamon I taste? Was that turbulence I just felt? I think so, we better fasten our seat belts. The entree comes. (We have now reached our cruising altitude of xxxx feet) I dig in to the collared greens. Lord these are some good collared greens. So flavourful. Enough bacon to keep you going back for more. Next is the biscuit. It was buttery and dense. Like a real southern biscuit. Here's where we hit more turbulence and where the flight made an emergency landing. I ordered grits on the side. I take one spoonful and all I could take is butter. I look down at the bowl of grits and there's a pile of grits and a noticeable layer of melted butter sitting on top. (The fasten seat belt sign comes back on as we hit more turbulence). Hmmm maybe if i mix them up thinking there's some fresh unbuttered grits on the bottom that when the bowl is properly mixed it will be the right of butter to grit consistency. WRONG. Another spoonful and all I taste is butter. This must be what Paula Dean was talking about when she said everything tastes better with butter. That lying heifer. I feel gross. I need an oil change. Next is the fried chicken. I take off a piece and stick it in my mouth (the oxygen masks drop from the ceiling and the cabin goes dark as there is a panic in the air). I know this must be a dream. I take another bite (the aisle lights on the floor light up and the emergency exit light is flashing) oh no, really this taste like... When I was walking to Brenda's I noticed there was a KFC next door. EFFFF no, is this KFC (the pilot comes on the intercom and announces we must make an emergency landing due to a problem in the engines). I eat a little more just to make sure it doesn't taste like KFC but I'm foiled because it is tasting that way. I try some hot sauce and the only that you can taste is the hot sauce. The hot sauce isn't that hot but that's hot much the chicken lacks. Maybe some sweet tea will wash this taste out of my mouth, ahhhh damn it has watermelon in it! We land safely on the ground before having to jump out the emergency doors and on to the fluffy inflatable slide. I will say that was an adventure. I won't say that I won't try it again. Perhaps if I order something else, I'll have a different outlook on the place. I'll give the place 2 stars. One star for the wait staff. They're so nice and there when you need them and there when you don't. The second star for the music they were playing.

One of the best brunches in the city. We discovered it on Yelp, ventured over to the sorta seedy part of town between Western Addition and the TL. Brenda's blew our socks off, we returned the following two weekends with more and more people. Start with the Beignets, even the crawfish one is amazing, don't be scared. And then check the Specials they usually have some amazing pancake or french toast concoction. Its a soul food, southern, cajun, new orleans type place. Crawdads with grits, beignets and fried-chicken benedicts. You know, the type of stuff that is real good for your soul but not as good for your body. Everything is good, there's usually a line, it is 100% worth it.

This place was so great. I had an omelet with grits and a biscuit and it was so scrumptious. I arrived at the perfect time because there was no wait but by the time I was leaving the black board had filled up with so many names for people waiting for a table. Brenda's was the highlight of my trip and I cant stop telling everyone and anyone about this great food for a reasonable price. I have definitely found my favorite thing about San Francisco.

I never thought that soul food could be healthy. I mean, fried food and food drowning in salty sauce isn't healthy but the food at Brenda's was fresh which is probably what made it seem healthy. ahah! But goodness, it was delicious! I got the sweet potato dumplings since it was something I've never heard of before. Who would ever think to put sweet potato in a dumpling and have it turn out to be soooo tasty?! Their collard greens were so yummy, too! I don't usually remember sides but that was difficult to forget. I wanted to go home and try to imitate the recipe for those greens. The service is great and the atmosphere is cool. I recommend this place for sure!

There's always a wait for weekend brunches so if you don't get there by 9am (they open at 8am) then be prepared to pull up some curb cuz you'll be waiting for awhile Definite must haves are the gumbo, grits and the beignets. Grits are the bomb here and should be ordered with every entree. I've never been a huge fan of grits been I am now. Can't decide which beignets to go with...plain, chocolate, apple or crayfish? Get the flight so you can try them all. Just make sure to bring a friend or two to help cuz they're not as good when you take em home. All in all, Brenda's is an excellent place to go for brunch. If you do wait, have some patience or get there earlier and you'll see that it was worth it.

Fully agree with some of the other more negative reviewers. I recently relocated from NYC and read about this place online one day. So we decided to go around noon on a Saturday. The wait was about 30 minutes, not too bad, being that we were used to the non-reservation/we are just really good - type of brunch place from back east. Anyway, the food was disappointing. Coffee was decent but the Beignets were soggy and greasy and more akin to something that had been sitting at dunkin donuts for hours. The portions were huge and impossible to finish. The granola-pancakes were mostly dry and boring.

Since we live close by, we jotted down our name at around 8:15am, went home and came back 30mins later.  Still waited another 15mins and the wait was growing. Service was cold.  Take the order, drop the food and flag down the server if you needed anything. I didn't care for the coffee. Too dark and don't like chicory. Plain Beignets were good, my first experience. Both of our potato hash were room temperature. The Andouille and Cheddar omellette was ok but there were more mushroom than the sausage. The eggs benedict was a big dissapointment.  I didn't care for the sauce, it was basically a dijon mustard sauce. Would I go back? Not worth the wait.

Go Brenda! Hate to sound like a rehash of everybody else, so... here are the little things that make me go gaga over Brenda's: 1. The strawberry jam. Homemade and subtly spiced, it is unlike any jam I've had. Can't figure out what the spices are, and she aint tellin. 2. The biscuit. Making these is an art, and I've found  the Rembrandts. They're creamy, soft and perfumed with butter in the center, flaky outside. 3. The chocolate beignets. Yes, the whole flight is good, and my partner went nuts over the crayfish ones. I say the Ghirardelli's dark chocolate in the center is exactly the right filling for these babies. They're not quite as light and airy as, for example, those at Cafe du Monde. However, the smoky, rich chocolate flavor makes everything all right. 4. The grillades-and-grits combo is perfect. Grits need a a foil, and this is it: fall-apart slices of top round in a sauce that proclaims its ancestry, redolent of garlic and onion. Move aside, brisket. This is the new king of braised beef dishes. 5. By the way, the grits have to be mentioned too. Puddles of butter, and they're yellow with much more flavor than most. So- easy 5 stars. Thank you, Brenda. You saved me from buying a ticket to New Orleans.

Seated in ~5 minutes on a weekday morning at 11 AM. Had Shrimp and Grits, plus an order of crawfish and plain beignets. Shrimp and grits gets a 5 stars, was great. Being from the south, I have had lots of shrimp and lots of grits, and this was very good for being all the way in California. Very large shrimp that seemed to never end, I kept finding more buried in cheesy, slightly spicy grits. Beignets were great too. Plain ones were perfect, crawfish could use a tad less spice on the outside in my opinion. Very unique taste though, and enjoyed it. Nice place.

YUM! We started out with 2 flights of beignets which were simply scrumptious. I thoroughly enjoyed all four flavors but I think the apple was my favorite. It was sweet but not too sweet, with a great texture contrast between the dough and apples. However, I think I will get the flight again next time because I would not want to miss out on the crawfish or chocolate beignets. The best part about the flights is that each flavor is completely different and a totally new experience. For the main course, I got the granola pancakes which were absolutely delicious. Big, fluffy pancakes with granola baked into the top. The granola also had some dried cranberries which added a nice chewy tang. On the top was several types of fruit and a bit of vanilla sauce. It didn't even need syrup since it was so flavorful and moist. Two of my companions agreed to split our dishes, so I also had a bit of the shrimp po' boy which was very, very good. The shrimp were cooked perfectly (light, crispy cornmeal batter) and the remoulade sauce complemented it well. Even the fries that came with it were excellent. Lastly, I had some shrimp & grits, which I believe was a special of the day. Those were also very yummy but not *quite* as amazing as the other dishes. As would be expected, the wait was no joke - we got there around 10am on a Sunday with a party of 4 and got seated around 11:30. But, wow, we will definitely be back. Maybe in a few months we'll have burned off all the calories we consumed this morning... Also I really highly recommend sharing dishes if you can find like-minded dining companions. Eating for a few minutes and then passing to the left is as fun as it is delicious.

WARNING: COME EARLY (Like an hour before the restaurant opens)!!   After a 2++ hours wait, we finally got seated.  By that time, I was so hungry, every thing sounded good.  However, the food was disappointingly typical brunch food.  Their famous crawfish beignets were tasty, but I wished the ratio of crawfish to fried dough was bigger.  I also tried their special of the day, fried catfish benedicts, which was sort of dry.   For the long wait, I had expected more than "creole-ish" diner food.

Went on a weekday, figured that it'd be slower as we went about an hour before closing - and still waited about 25 minutes or so since there are only like 25+ seats or so inside The good - friendly service, crawfish beignet, watermelon ice tea, grits and bananas foster french toast Not so good - regular beignets were hard and overcooked, the meat with the grits was meh Would give it a 3.5 rating, but rounded up because of the friendly staff Bill was mid 40's for 2ppl, not bad - but for the food & value I'd rather go to mama's

Sorry Yelpers but the hype monster has struck again. #1 Yes, the place is small so expect a very long wait ( more than a 1hr for anytime during the weekend brunch rush). #2 No, those beignets aren't very good. Very chewy and tough exterior, not light and fluffy at all. #3 The best part of the meal were the biscuits. Crumbly, buttery, rich. The potatoes and eggs were decent (fairly standard greasy spoon faire). Overall, wouldn't wait over an hour for the food. The food and the price were okay but not something that I'd be willing to wait that long for. I'd give it a try once so you can see for yourself. I probably won't be going back, though.

The food is awesome and the only down side is the wait to sit down during busy time. I have tried a lot of things here for the first time.  Watermelon Ice Tea , for example, was very good and not too sweet.  Fried Oyster Poyboy and Pickled Watermelon Rind were great. Beignet Flight is good for sampling the 4 varieties, but I have to say the apple filling was nothing special.  The plain, chocolate, and crawfish beignets were great though. The biscuits served at breakfast were TO DO FOR!  They are served with butter and homemade strawberry jam preserves are on the table.  OMG!  I would have rather had another biscuit instead of the breakfast potatoes. The restaurant is small and cozy.  One wall is mirrored and has high-chair seating.  The opposite wall has 4 tables and there are a few other tables available.  The staff is very nice and Brenda was working all the times that I have visited.  I overheard a waitress tell a customer the cook that day was Creole.

Grits The waiting is horrible and they are not good at providing estimates.  The food is okay, you definitely leave stuffed...  The shrimp po-boy is on 7x7 100 things to try before you die... it is good, but I am not sure it is a to try before you die.   I am glad we tried the place, but we have other favorites ... like Kate's kitchen...

Any good San Franciscan knows how to brunch.  There are two forms of proper brunching:  The celebratory brunch, and the I'm so hungover I want to eat a ton of delicious food and not move from my couch the rest of the day brunch. If you prefer the latter, GO TO BRENDAS!  Save the celebratory brunches for lime, or a friends house where the chef of the group tries to impress you with their creative interpretation of scrambled eggs (NOT! nice try, the mimosas are delicious tho...)  I digress... Yea the lines kinda long if you wait till your hangover is tolerable, but suck it up, because once your diving into a Fried catfish eggs benny with spicy remoulade and a side of grits, you know it was all worth it.  Consider the wait a small price to pay for the best food coma you will ever have the pleasure of being in.

This is one of those high expectations places that lived up to the hype.  Brenda's get's great reviews, it's on the 7x7 list and there is always a line. So I expected a lot, and, unlike so many disappointments, I was surprised to find that this place is all it's cracked up to be! Had the beignet flight, grits and the fried shrimp po boy.  The beignets were a little heavy, but I actually liked them a lot that way.. they were hearty and tasted amazing.  The best of the beignets was the apple with the savory crawfish a close second.  The grits were amazing, definitely get a side.  The po-boy lived up to it's rep, with amazing sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp.  I'll definitely brave the line again for this place!

Well, I'm from the south and this ain't no N.O. style food. Soul food doesn't necessarily mean drenched in grease, butter, and cheese... If it is, it better be worth it in terms of taste; the dishes we had were not (Shrimp + Grits and Braised beef + Grits). The grits were very good, but everything else just left you with a mouth full of lard, and feeling sick afterwards. The beignet's are definitely great though, that's the only reason I gace them 3 starts.

OMG!  I am in love with the french toast.  You gotta get the sauce/syrup that is offered with it.  Oh and the beignet sampler was a great way to try them all.  When I think of beignets, the first place that comes to mind is this place.  To top off my meal, a great cup of coffee.  I could not believe the size of the mug.  It was like drinking soup for coffee.  No need for refills.  Yes, indeed...a great way to end the meal.  I think it's time to call up the girls and have another Sunday brunch at Brenda's.  Definitely worth the wait.

Flight of beignets was sinful and ridiculously delicious.  All four (plain, chocolate, apple, crawfish) beignets were great, but my favorites were the chocolate and crawfish.  Service was good.  Due to the popularity of Brenda's, the wait time a bit long, but worth it.

Hope you're hungry is all that I can say! Starting off with the beignet flight will be your first stop on the way to food coma heaven. If you are with friends, even better as there is something in the flight for everyone. I had the Hangtown Fry which was probably a bit ambitious after the beignets but I enjoyed every minute of it. This is a brunch that you will definitely enjoy, just be prepared to wait.

I am part of a group of 8 girlfriends who all used to live in SF and get together once a month in SF to catch up and have a yummy brunch.  But we are picky about the location.  There is nothing worse than a disappointing brunch.  But at the same time - we don't want to spend $20.00 for fancy free range waffles. Nobody wants to wait - so, bring a book and just accept it.  Not only was the food totally delish...It was a big birthday for me and Andrew (manager) and his team were awesome and helped to make it a special day.  Fantastic service and a fun and animated vibe.  We will be back!

The long wait is not indicative of the quality of food served here. The "feign-ets" we're just gross, marginally better than inedible. It would be unfair to compare them to cafe du monde, but even if they called it a donut it would still be just as bad. The grits were runny and biscuits were dry. The service was not a relief from the bad food. The greasy-haired waiter looked like he came in from his Mission studio without showering, muttering "know what you want?" as a greeting. Do yourself a favor and opt for Brenda's neighbor: Taco Bell.

I had the Po'Boy and my bf had the shrimp grits both were awesome! The only complaint I have is that it's too packed in there. I was rubbing elbows with the strangers next to me.

The 7x7 list brought me here, but let me tell you, the Crawfish Po'Boy is so freaking good, way better then the fried shrimp one. The prices are amazing, and the food is better. Its a cute restaurant as well, I love the set up. The craw fish beignets  were so delicious, I have been craving them everyday since. This place gets packed, and there you can't make reservations. But the later in the evening you show up, the less time you will have to wait for a table.

I ordered the vegetarian sandwich (there's just one on the menu) and my friend ordered a salami and cheese sandwich. Both sandwiches were bad. My "sloppy josephine" was a pile of mashed tofu on a very soggy bun, no trimmings, no flavor. The cheese in my friend's sandwich leaked so much grease that it was inedible. The extra star is for the french fries, they were good.

I wanted to come back to try their Sweet Potato Pancakes but it was unexpectedly taken off the menu. Fortunately, I came with a group that included fellow Yelpers Antony N and Valerie C and tried almost everything that was available on their special menu. The wait was long as usual but the key is to arrive by 9am or prior to minimize the experience. The five of us were eventually seated in the middle of the smoky room which was fully packed with an air of deliciousness hovering in the air. We started with a plate of Crawfish Beignets ($6) which was prepared with a fluffy bready exterior lightly seasoned with cayenne, crawfish, scallions and cheddar to fill the core. I can eat a whole plate of these beignets by myself but was glad to make room for other dishes that followed. I absolutely loved this California specialty (http://whatscookingameri…), Hangtown Fry ($11), which came with fried oyster and bacon scramble with a truck load of potatoes and a fist size biscuit which came with a buttery, doughy and flaky texture. Anthony N ordered a Fried Catfish Eggs Benedict ($11) which came with thick hollandaise sauce and perfectly poached eggs to intermingle with flavorfully executed golden crispy catfish. Although a bit redundant, I also enjoyed my friend Linda's Catfish Po-boy which was underscored by a delicious roll that was crispy and fluffy in all the right places. Finally, Valerie C's plate of Shrimps and Grits ($11.75) was filled with gooey cheddar, grits, sweet tomatoes, savory bacon and jumbo shrimps. It was probably the only dish that might be better to share as the heavy tasting grits had all the right sweet and savory elements anchored by a delightful shrimp flavor. Our server was pleasant and friendly but she was also overstretched by all the demands coming from all directions in the restaurant. I hear rumors about the possibility of them expanding into next door so I look forward to coming back when the wait is scaled back significantly. The only dish we didn't get to try on their special menu was the Black Cherry Chocolate Chip Pancakes which sounded sinfully delicious too, but I look forward to having them to bring back the Sweet Potato Pancakes on my next visit.

My close friend was moving into the area and we came here with voracious appetites roaring around 2pm. The place was packed with a slight (10-15 minute or so) wait. Although we were seated by the door (something I greatly dislike especially on windy SF days), I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. We both ordered the watermelon ice tea (which comes with free refills!) and weren't disappointed. It was refreshing and memorable. It was so good that I came home and tried to make two pitchers of it myself but sadly it's not quite the same. We shared the variety beignets. My favorite was the crawfish and cinnamon apple. The plain and chocolate were good too. We also had the Eggs and Bacon Tartine with grits. Grits were super tasty while the Eggs and Bacon Tartine was good, although a little greasy. I'd try something else next time. About the atmosphere: This place looks really chic. Lots of natural lighting and an eco-friendly chalk board to jot down your name for a table when you enter through the door. All in all, I was a happy customer and will gladly return.

Finally bf & I got to try Brenda's French Soul Food!  Even before 12 on a weekday the wait was about 15-20 minutes.  And everyone wasn't kidding on how tiny this place is!   Glad we waited & tried it though.  We ordered the Beignet Flight ($9) appetizer to share.  He ordered the BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken) ($12.75) & I ordered the Shrimp & Grits ($12).  He also got a sweet watermelon iced tea ($2.25) to sip on.  Glad I tried the assorted beignets but our number one pick was the savory crawfish beignet...omg soo good!  First time trying crawfish & it didn't disappoint.  My second favorite was the apple beignet.  I usually don't care for apples in my desserts but this was delish and NOT too sweet.  The chocolate was a little too decadent for me & the plain wasn't anything extraordinary.  He said his watermelon tea was okay but just tasted like iced tea, no watermelon taste.  Out came out the entrees & I was all over my shrimp and grits!  It was served piping hot & was oh so cheesy!  Loved the spicy tomato sauce & the bits of bacon in it.  I definitively took home leftovers since I was getting full after the beignets...massive carb overload!  He liked how moist his three piece chicken was, however the skin wasn't very crispy, it was kinda soggy.  It was also served ontop of a bed of seasoned fries (they weren't crispy though sadly).  I am not a biscuit girl but I really liked the biscuits that were served with his BFC!  They weren't dry, and they were buttery enough, topped with the jam at the table it was perfect.   Parking was difficult but we managed to finally find a spot about a block up after circling around for about five minutes.  I think next time we'd order some beignets & shrimp & grits to go.  I could get used to this soul food even though it's so not good for my diet or heart!

Wait for brunch was crazy. Service was hurried, but efficient. Overall the food was decent, but nothing wowed. Beignets weren't as good as I was hoping... Wish they had more filling... Maybe we got an off batch. I love grits and order them anytime I see them on a menu. Too greasy here. Considering the wait, I probably won't return.

The food was excellent, the atmosphere was quite nice. The service, unfortunately was brusque and quite unprofessional. When gently trying to get a server's attention we were told 'I'm busy here right now' instead of 'I'll be over to help you in a minute'.  Food was auctioned off "who had this?' for apps, entrees and dessert- or simply plopped down in front of the wrong person. On the plus side, this seems to be one of the few places that serves a proper and unadulterated cappucino, the fried green tomatoes were delicious, the red beans and rice and catfish authentic for this former resident of NOLA, and the watermelon ice tea refreshing. All of our food was quite good. With even adequate service, we would have given Brenda's 5 stars. We will definitely return for the food, but fervently hope for better servers.

go early or go late...who am i kidding?  be prepared to wait. and wait and wait with the other die hard followers.   we've left defeated and literally could not "stomach" the wait but this time, we were on a serious mission. and if you can't stand the wait...to-go is the way to do it. be sure that it's a diet free day because there is lots of love and tons of calories in the french cajun soul food. the crawfish beignets with chedder, scallions, and tons of cayenne was spicy, warm, and delicious.  they come in threes and if you can't decide on plain, chocolate, granny smith or crawfish- get the flight and get one of each. wash it down with the bottomless sweet watermelon tea. it took me back to the hot summer days in georgia...sitting on the front porch and watching the grass grow.  ok, i'm not from down south but it was "soul"-icious. the special that day included eggs benedict made with a flaky biscuit and i went for the added fried catfish option.  it was creamy, buttery, fatty and utterly heavenly. the grits were loaded with butter and not for the faint of heart. i loved the little white pots of homemade jams.  just slather it over the buttery (note the butter theme in this review) biscuits.  the peach was good but the strawberry was the definite winner. a walk home sounded like a good idea at first but since we could barely move, we rolled into a cab and off for a Sunday nappie.

Writing a review like this makes me feel a tad mental. Portions of me are wowed, but I'm partially disappointed. Very pleased and at the same time irritated. The GOOD: "French soul food" does not really scream "vegan", so the fact that Brenda's has a vegan sloppy joe option on their lunch menu is very very cool. I'm never in my hood during the weekdays for lunch, so I emailed Brenda's asking if I could give this sandwich a go on the weekend even though it's not on their standard weekend menu. Brenda emailed me back saying not a problem, she'd let her staff know and when I actually ordered it this Saturday I had zero issue placing the order. And the watermelon tea... amazingly good. I can't think of a more refreshing beverage to tell you the truth. Very flexible, very good tea, very helpful staff. The SO-SO:  I busted my sandwich out of the box with high hopes and it certainly looked good, but getting into it I wasn't blown away. I know vegan sloppy joes aren't their specialty but still, with the level of craftsmanship I'd read about I was expecting a unique twist. Maybe some different spices in it, maybe some chopped veggies, but the end result was a fairly standard vegan sloppy joe. Good? Sure, 3 stars. 3 ain't bad, it's just not a "wow!" type of sandwich. I've made similar at home fairly easily. The BAD: Irritation. They advertise "Vegan Sloppy Joesephine" on their menu under sandwiches. Peeps aren't altering it to make it vegan, they're not getting it special, Brenda's is actually advertising it as a vegan option. So why would you not have a side dish that's vegan? "Do you want coleslaw or fries?" I was asked, "Neither are vegan, but those are the two side options with sandwiches" (slaw is rarely vegan and the fries are cooked in the same oil as the dairy/seafood). That's like advertising a kosher option on your menu but the only side dish that comes standard is pork rinds. It just doesn't make sense, if you want to tap a specific market at least have a little back up to complete the process. I asked her what she'd recommend a vegan do, ordering the vegan option with no vegan options for sides and after she pondered awhile I was offered a side of fruit. I was so looking forward to the watermelon pickles advertised on the menu with my sandwich but alas, none came with my food. There were highlights, there were lowlights, and there was the unremarkable. I think that balances fairly at 3 stars, don't you? Brenda's is known for it's non vegan food for sure, and my girlfriends pancakes looked amazing. If I had a posse that wanted to roll to Brenda's I'd go, the sloppy joe is solid, I just don't think I'll be going out of my way for just myself.

Every bit as good as all these fools have said. This morning I ordered the shrimp beignets, eggs benedict with fried catfish, and grillades and grits and I am STILL trying to finish off the leftovers at 5pm. Sure its sitting like a rock in there and my ulcer is flaring like a cold sore during finals week but it is worth the discomfort.  I am kicking myself for not ordering the pumpkin bread french toast but I am holding out until my cholesteral has returned to south of the Mason Dixon line.

Now that I'm not vegan, I've been back a few times and I freaking love it. The biscuits are HUGE and insanely delicious, and I love their breakfasts. I also had a chicken salad and the mustard dressing was beyond delicious. Get the beignets!!! Nothing says awesome like hot, oozing ghirardelli chocolate.

This is my new hangout.  You can't come here unless you are in the club with all the cool kids.  So far only Adam and I are in the club.  Only we know the password.  If you're lucky one of us will like you or sleep with you or think you might sleep with us and we'll take you here. You would really want Adam and I to take you here because this is the BEST food EV-ER.  My Mascarpone French Toast with Strawberry Coulis and Walnuts was so good I wanted to smear it all over my body.  You know, for seconds later.  I think Adam felt the same way about his Catfish Po'Boy.  I would swim in their Watermelon Sweet Tea if I knew that I was the only one swimming in it because I don't pee in pools. Adam and I are going to come here all the time for club meetings.  Maybe if you turn out to be one of the cool kids like us we'll invite you. Update: Natalie N. and I ate brunch here today and it was so good I almost changed my mind about moving to Hawaii. Almost.  Pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter syrup and a hint of powdered sugar almost beat out the love of my life for my heart. Almost.  Then I ate their beignet flight when I got home.  Perfection and a better deal then ordering them individually.  Can't I have Brenda's AND live in Hawaii?  It's such an unfair choice...love vs. food.

I went to Brenda's and was utterly displeased by the staff.  We wanted to take away some coffee and beignets and they actually turned us away because they had "just seated the breakfast crowd."  It was 8 a.m. and not all the tables were filled.  The comment was, "Well, we just can't.  We just seated everyone and there's no way we can do your order unless you're willing to wati 45 minutes to an hour."  I have my own cafe and believe me, we never never turn anyone away!  I was disgusted because they weren't even nice about it.  I've had beignets in New Orleans so it was no real loss, but I was surprised at the attitude.  I won't go again- I don't care how great the food is.

Soulful Creole Cooking in the Heart of the City. Again, why the hype? I feel like there's a YELP clan out there, where they go somewhere and start a trend of writing 5 star reviews... I'm serious... why does this place deserve such high ratings? It's good but not 5 star good. 3.5~4ish... mebe I've been spoiled by REAL Cajun/Creole food in LA... crazy madness. Def a cute, cozy ass spot. Fair amount of meter parking, considering the fact we came around 11, yes, we did beat lunch traffic. The use of such quality ingredients, giving that homemade kick - nice! We started off with the infamous chicken, sausage and okra gumbo ($3.50/cup, and $6.50/bowl). It was okay...the rice was sinking in the soup... Kinda bland, so you must, I INSIST, you use their Louisiana Hot Sauce, for me, the LHS was kinda sweet, but it was better than having my gumbo bland, so... The ultimate winner: Baked Brie en Croute ($8).  Basically, a combo of mixed greens, fried shallots and pecans w/creole dressing. Not fond of the salad, but that baked brie. Omg, that was sooo freakin good! The flaky crossainty, pastry = major thumbs up. I could eat these suckers forEVERs. If they sold it individually, I'd prolly buy a handful, minding my muffin top. The fried poboy sandwich - the fried OYSTER. YUM. You get a choice of fried shrimp or fried oyster - get the oyster!! ($9.25) had more of the crispy batter that you could barely taste the oyster but it was good though, different, and good. I'd so order this again... Served on a grilled French roll w/spicy Cajun mayo.  The pomme frites were fresh but I think I would pass. Oh and of course, you can't forget to order their specials...  Make sure to read the black board when you walk in, or just turn to the mirror, and see for yourself. The mirror has a list of the specials for the day. We ordered their Blk eye peas w/ andouille sausage ($10). This was also pretty darn good. I approve on this. HAHA. All in all, decent, but not to the point of me becoming a regular.

My fellow Yelpers...  Ask not whether you ought to try Brenda's French Soul Food.  The wait list to eat here may be long at 10am but the wait and anticipation of eating here is worth it.  Outside the door is a wait list where you put your name and number in your party.            _____________         | ...                          |         | ...                          |         | ...                          |         |~~~~~~~~~~  2  |         | ~~~~~~~~~~ 2  |         | Nanette          2  |         ______________ Be prepared to come with a small party as this place seats a maximum of 40 people.  Inside, the place looks like what you would see in New Orleans with century old beaded panel wainscoting.  The color scheme is white, black, and deep ox-blood with simple furnishings and made wide with a mirror on one wall by the counter seating.   For starters, we had to try their gumbo.  There was a little puddle of grease swimming on the surface but you can push it away with your soup spoon.  The gumbo was hella-burpy delicious and full of flavor.  Nothing is going to crawl out of this pot; all the ingredients came together in this authentic dish.  My order of fried catfish po'boy sandwich with shoe string fries was scrumptious.  The catfish was fresh, moist, and not over fried.  It was served on a toasted French roll with lettuce, tomato, and a splash of chipotle remoulade.  There was a good combination of texture in this item.  You can taste the moistness of the fish, the crunchiness in the toasted roll, the light chipotle spiciness, and the fresh coolness of the lettuce and tomato.  The shoestring fries were fried just right with enough fried brown coloring and crispness.  This order also comes with a few slices of crisp butter chip pickles.  I wish we had room for beignets but that's for another visit.  The day's beverage special was watermelon ice tea which was absolutely tasty with a sprig of mint. There is metered parking for an hour.  With the wait time, be prepared to feed the meter before your dining experience ends.

I just got back from the New Orleans JazzFest, and the first thing I want to write about is Brenda's, right here at home.  I'm feeling thankful, y'all.  Personally, I'm glad there's so many bad reviews of Brenda's! I'd like to discourage everyone from going there, in order to make the line shorter for me. I'd even give it 1 star to help drive the average down.  However, Karma is a bitch, and Well Fed Ted only gives an honest review.  Brenda, she's all that..  Brenda's joint is a mind-blowing 6 star-worthy experience.  But Yelp don't reach that high... Let's face it.  The worst thing about Brenda's is the long-azz line on the weekends. Enticed by word-of-mouth and Yelp reviews, but discouraged by the mega-queue, it took a long time to get in and check her out for myself. I finally went in for a weekday breakfast with my gf's 'Breakfast Club' and I was straight-up blown away! By the B-club as well as Brenda's. No, the B-club was not inspired by the delightfully inspired teen flick of the same name... However, I digress. Lemme explain. I'm a NOLA junky. NOLA - New Orleans, Louisiana, son. My first visit in '95 must have introduced some new element into my body chemistry, lowered my resistance to pure, uncut joy or something. Because ever since I returned from that trip, I have, at minimum, an annual craving for the Crescent City and all its goodness. Which is why I've been so bummed with the underwhelming NOLA-related cuisine in the Bay Area. Not a great restaurant in the bunch, with the singular exception of Gator's long deceased joint in Noe Valley. Until Brenda's, no one has served up anything resembling a fix for my Big Easy Jones. Poor Gator never did build an audience in SF, so he's now on the Peninsula, slim, trim and serving up a healthier version of the Lord's choice of fattening cuisines. But ain't no lo-cal happening on Polk Street, my brotha!.  Miss Brenda is f'n up your diet in the best way... About the food....  You don't need a lot of descrip from me after 200+ reviews.  But I can clear up some of your confusion by pointing out to you that it's a Creole Diner.  If the dishes don't match your palate and expectations, recalibrate.  The beignet flight is a must.  Plain, apple, chocolate and crawfish, you can't miss!  These are the only legit beignets I've ever had outside of NOLA. No, it's not Cafe Du Monde, but every other beignet I've had in Cali sucked.  The biscuits are flaky, divine goodness.  The grits are buttery, creamy and dreamy.  Best of all, the Hangtown Fry Omelette!  Even I was intimidated by the thought of fried oysters AND bacon in an omelette...  Soft, light eggs. Still crispy fry batter-crusted oysters within.  And bacon, crispy, delicious bacon.  I'm verklempt...but for your sake, I must go on.  Because, this huge monster of a meal stretched my tummy in the best of ways.  Every time I thought I was almost done, I just had to taste a few more bites.  And so on, and so on.  Until, poof, it was all gone. Final notes.  Kind service, I always appreciate.  They hooked up tables for our party of 10 like it was no big.  Remember, it was a weekday.  The coffee I like, but it's definitely not for everyone.  It's strong and dark, like me.  Hahaha.  But more to the point, it's authentic, and matches what you might find in a diner down that way.  Lastly, don't sleep on the homemade jam, damn it's good!!!

I waited for about 1 hour and I can safely say that I would have waited for 2 to eat here.  The food was perfect.  Perfect.  Did you hear me...I said PERFECT.  Sorry, I just got a little excited.  O.k., aroused.  In all seriousness, if Brenda is single....hook me up.  I have never in my life had grits that made me think of marriage proposal.  The Beignets should be considered a national treasure.  The BBQ pork po boy sandwich is like a crack addicts discovery of a suitcase full of crack.  If it had been acceptable to lick the plate clean I would have.  Instead I left the precious pork juice on my plate.  The corn bread was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  This place needs to in my opinion maintain its difficulty in eating at.  I have the patience of the cat and I will always out wait all those suckers that looked at the 3 page wait list and walk away.  Oh did your mental weakness or empty stomach prevent you from staying until your name was called?  Oh, it did?  Good.  This place deserves clientele that will stick it out and appreciate the food.   Beignets bitches. Beignets.

When my sister called and asked if I wanted to have Brenda's for lunch, I said heck yea!  I was so excited to finally try this place after hearing so much about it.   This place is tiny - no wonder it takes forever to get a table during peak hours.  A sign on the wall said that the maximum capacity was 50 ppl, but I highly doubt it unless ppl are gonna be squished in like sardines.  Seating capacity is 30, max.  They have 2 tables that seat 4 ppl each, 1 table for 3 (facing the window), "bar area" with about 5 stools, and another 4-5 tables that seat 2.  Do the math - come early if you don't wanna wait forever for a table! They don't seat unless the entire party is present.  We arrived around noon and scored the last table for 4.  Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, and went over all the specials of the day.  I decided on a dish that had scrambled eggs with fried oysters, bacon, and green onions, with a side of hash and a biscuit ($10).  It was delicious!  I only wish that it came with more oysters - there were about 4-5 little pieces.  The hash was large pieces of red potatoes wonderfully made and full of flavor.  The biscuit was also very tasty - it was nice because it wasn't tooo buttery.  Other dishes our party ordered were the oyster poboy, andouille and cheddar omelette, and the grillades and grits.  I had a taste of each dish and I must say that enjoyed all of them.  The beef cutlets were very tender and the gravy went well with the biscuits - it was a little too salty for my dad tho.  The poboy was excellent, with oysters topped with a chipotle remoulade.  Omelette was packed with flavor and the sauce piquant went very well with it. Dessert were the plain beignets - it came with 3 pieces ($4).  They put tons of powdered suger - awesome!  It was super hot and fresh and each bite was magical.  Just as I had expected. Most memorable was the house made jelly.  I really think they put crack in it -  I was completely hooked after the first taste.  Everything about it was perfect - texture, flavor, color.  I spread globs of it all over my biscuit and beignet.  I think I cleaned out the entire jar - oops! Come early and leave stuffed with a smile on your face - expect to suffer from food coma afterwards, so productivity at work will be relatively low.  =) FYI - parking meters are a rip off in the area - $.25 gets you 6 mins.

Whoa. This place is just as good as everyone says. I fully stuffed my face with pure awesomeness and loved every bite. We ordered the crawfish beignets to start and they were sublime. We also shared the catfish eggs benedict, catfish po boy, and of course a side of bacon. Everything tasted amazing, the portions were huge, and the servers were super friendly. The inside of the restaurant is also super cute and intimate. All of the other dishes looked amazing...I especially want to try the shrimp and grits....oh man it looked so cheesy....I love cheese. We did wait for an hour, but it was totally worth it. Next time I'll bring a flask of mimosas for the wait. lol

I don't even want to share this review because I want to keep this place to myself! It is small and there's almost always a wait for breakfast. But it is wry much worth it! They have savory and sweet beignets that are to die for. The crawfish beignets are a must try in your lifetime.

the food here is SOO good! i came here on a thursday afternoon and still had to wait around (imagine weekends - CRAZY!).  this is a teeny tiny place, so the less people you're with the better! that said, you get heaping portions at great prices. must haves: beignet flight - crawfish, plain, apple, molten chocolate filled.  ALL delicious! hangtown fry: you get grits (fatty but soo yummy), oyster and bacon scramble loaded with plump oysters, topped off with a delicious biscuit (make sure to slather it w/house made jam) and nope, even a fatty like me could not finish everything!   service was super sweet and attentive.  i'll definitely be back!

mMMmm watermelon ice tea mMmmmmm crawfish beignet Brenda's is a cute little restaurant with a homey feeling. I kind of wish it was a litte bigger though. Juliane N., Steven T., and I sat on a table right next to the counter seats. My head was literally almost touching the guys a$$ but anyways. I like how Brenda's has a beignet sampler for those who can't decide which ones to get. The beignet sampler (flight) comes with plain, chocolate, apple cinnamon, and CRAWFISH. I thought it was kind of weird that they put salt and sweet stuff together. Since I wasn't that hungry I planned to share with Juliane N and Steven T and ordered myself a cup of gumbo since it seemed like a really good sell. This was my first gumbo experience so I was pretty excited to try it. I guess according to Steven T it wasn't the best. I personally thought it was a little too salty for me and too little rice. I actually didn't finish the cup =(. The mac and cheese was soo soo soo good. My bf would have loved it since he loves cheese. Too bad he didn't come with us. It was so cheesy and creamy. Omg I should have just ordered that instead of the gumbo. Watermelon ice tea was really refreshing. Just the right amount of sugar. I will probably come back to try the other items on the menu. Probably the pot pie that Vincent K was talking about.

Brenda will you adopt me? And if you do, will you still love me when I'm 400 lbs from all your good home cooking? For real, my favorite hobby is stalking Evan L. and Katherine C. via Yelp. So whither they goest, I goest. After reading their stellar reviews of Brenda's French Soul Food I came here today for brunch. And it did not disappoint. We did have to wait a bit but it wasn't too terrible. I had the watermelon sweet tea. Get this. It's amazingly refreshing and there are chunks of watermelon in the glass which you can dig out and eat. I know I did. We got the beignet flight and holy moley was it good. The crawfish beignet rocked the house but even the plain beignet was good. I think fried dough might give the fried potato a run for it's money in my clogged up little heart. I had the hangtown fry scramble which was so decadent I could only finish half. Big juicy oysters scrambled up with bacon and served with potato hash. Make sure you order something that comes with a biscuit. Brenda's cream biscuits mean business. I slathered mine with some sweet cream butter and homemade strawberry jam and was immediately delivered to heaven. Mmmmmmmmmm. Every plate we saw come out of the kitchen looked delish and the portions are GENEROUS. A favorite new breakfast place.

I gave if 4 stars for the food, BUT I have this to say- go for the food and NOT the customer service. I knew that there is no such thing as French Soul food, my husband is French and a Chef, so enough said. I knew before opening the link or reading the reviews that they were serving beignets and grits that was why they would call themselves a French Soul food restaurant, but I wanted to go after I saw the Hangtown Fry on the menu. The service was not at all what I expected from a restaurant that when we first tried to go on Sunday around 10AM had an hour and a half wait with the line outside. We returned Monday promptly at 8Am when they opened and were among the first 3 couples to be seated, so its not as if they had been open all day and had a horrible day or our waitress had a bad customer or anything, but I guess people come for the food, and so will I, keeping in mind that the service was not good at all! As I sit here writing this I am finishing the leftovers for the day, which are still delish!. I enjoyed the crawfish beignet and my grits with my order. The beignets were not light and fluffy like I was accustomed to, but they were still good and HUGE. The grits were made with some cream or milk because they were very rich and the added butter and cheese helped add to the texture. The Mocha was perfectly blended as well. Hubby had a well balanced Latte and veggie omelet and apple beignet. Like I said go for the food and not the service and your expectations will be met accordingly.

I must admit, I did come in with high expectations, but only left with a sour taste for Brendas. Tracy, Juliane, and I came here for lunch since we've always all wanted to try Brendas for quite some time. I'd say we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a space to open up. The place is rather small with a few counter seats around the peripheral and tables packed tightly. Brendas it hit or miss in my opinion when it comes to which dish you order. The flight of beignets were good, but not overly special. I had trouble choosing an entree, but since it was French soul food I figured I would order some typical "French soul food." One of the specials for the day was the jambalaya... and boy was it special. Honestly, it was the worst jambalaya I have ever tasted. The whole jambalaya was mushy as if it was coarse mashed potatoes. The adouille sausage and chicken was dry and tough and the whole thing was just WHACK! Tracy ordered the gumbo which was also a huge disappointment. The gumbo was just off and the rue was too thick and creamy.  I don't claim to be an expert, but I did live in the South for some time and one of my soldiers mom from New Orleans used to cook for us pretty often, now that was some good stuff. Brenda did earn a star back for their BOMB ASS MAC'N'CHEESE. The macaroni was SOOOOO cheesy, creamy, and just perfect. If I ever came back I would order the mac n cheese. Juliane had ordered the corned beef which was probably the best out of all our plates, in my opinion. The corned beef hash was greatly portioned and tasted quite good to boot. shoulda ordered some kinda breakfast plate or sandwich as they looked pretty darn good. I shoulda known that server would tell me the jambalaya is good, because they just say everything they serve tastes good.

The food was delicious but I'm not sure it was worth the wait. Me and my friends had Sunday brunch here and waited over an hour! I had the bacon tartine which was absolutely delightful. We got an assorted mix of beignets which were very delicious as well. The prices were reasonable for really tasty food. I would suggest getting here super early in the morning to avoid an hour plus wait. Overall, I enjoyed it.

Brenda's is finally open for DINNER! Woohoo!!! Craving for some soul food after my trip to the Big Easy and going to Brenda's sounded good. I heard that Brenda was serving dinner now. The newly remodeled Brenda's was very different. It no longer had the cozy, warm feeling it had. It didn't have the 'Southern charm'. However, I liked the new look for its modern and contemporary taste. Loved the exposed concrete wall and the ornate ceiling. There was definitely more seats and I hear they are planning to expand even more in a few months. The dinner menu had some familiar dishes that carried over from lunch such as gumbo and fried chicken. They had a good selection of oyster dishes! We ordered a bowl of chicken and sausage gumbo, one BFC breast, a side of mac n' cheese, and molasses pork chop with candied yams, hushpuppies and collard greens.   Gumbo: good, however.... (Took leftovers home and the next day found a small piece of plastic in the gumbo!!!!) Fried chicken (BFC): Average. More on the spicy side which I liked. Chicken was not as tender and flavorful as I would like it. Mac n' cheese: Average. Not as creamy and cheesy as I would like it too. Molasses Pork Chop: This was a HUGE disappointment. The pork chop was smaller than the sides. For $15, I expected a thick and entree size pork chop!! Pork chop was super thin and small. It was slightly over cooked and pork became rubbery. I told the waitress and she even agreed that the pork chop was too small. WHY did you serve it to me then? However, she was kind enough to give me another pork chop. It was another thin, small piece. It was only slightly bigger than the first. For the price, maybe include 2 slices of the thin pork chop instead of 1? The entree came with 2 small pieces of yam and 2 hushpuppies. Yams were good but I only had 2. Hushpuppies could have a bit more seasoning. Collard greens were too salty! I love dining at Brenda's but dinner needs a little work. I know it's their first night but it needs to change. I expected a lot more from Brenda's as I am a loyal brunch patron. I'm giving it 2.5 stars. Service was still great. Ambiance was pleasant. Food and price were near average. Discovering plastic in the gumbo was disappointing.

The most annoying thing about this place is the lack of parking - there's going to be a wait, and they won't seat you until the whole party is there, so you have to guess and keep feeding the meter if you're parked on the street.  There is a very small waiting area in the restaurant.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2 on a Saturday around 1 pm.  The waitress was really nice, I thought the decor was well done and very airy - the restaurant has a great atmosphere.  We ordered the beignet flight and the molasses ham benedict.  The beignets were fresh and pretty good, but seemed a little dense and I'm not sure if crawfish always has that fishy flavor - I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't order the crawfish beignet again.  Their molasses ham benedict was decent, the biscuit tasted more similar to corn bread than an english muffin, so that was different.  Their grits were good - cheesy, buttery, and delicious.  The watermelon ice tea with free refills was very refreshing and enjoyable.  While I enjoyed the food and the service and atmosphere were great, I probably wouldn't come back unless I had a reservation and/or didn't have to worry about street parking - it is one of the few places in the area that serves a decent, not mind-blowing, but decent beignet.

Eager to visit again since we thoroughly enjoyed our first time, we were highly disappointed with the dishes ordered and the service rendered during our second go-round.  My eating companion ordered the shrimp and grits, minus the bacon, and it was a hot greasy mess.  The main host (I am assuming he's the manager), was not friendly at all, so we were hesitant to discuss the matter with him.  Luckily, one of our waitresses came to the table and asked how we were doing,  My companion dialogued with her in Spanish (a plus), and she advocated on our behalf.  I ordered the jambalaya, which was...ok, but lacking that Southern flavor that I'm used to.  It was more heat than actual spice.  I'm ready to try another spot now...

Dear Brenda, I tried visiting your restaurant on Sunday, Dec. 30th.  My ADD must have not allowed me to realize that you don't open on Sundays and I my trek to the Loin in search of good food was shot down in a heart beat.  I am not gonna lie... I really hated on you at the moment... I mean... hate, hate, hate.  Well, I went to look for a substitute.... I ended up at another place that claimed to have great brunch and even a place by their door claiming to be the best brunch place back in 2005.  Food goes bad real fast from 2005 to 2007 (I'll be it... 2 days short of 2008.)  After this less than great meal I hated on you some more... for about 2 days every time I went to eat I said... Brenda I hate you. Then I decided to go on New Year's day... I wanted to start the year right.... I decided that I would eat these fine biscuits I read about. Because damn it... what Amelia wants... she eventually gets! So, after a lovely NYE with friends, I wake up with hunger pains... I think to myself... Brenda... you did me wrong... I am hungry.  So we drive up and see that it is located right next to the KFC.  I find a spot and I am so happy I don't need any quarters... I figure... Brenda, things are really looking up for you!  So we walk up and see the crowd outside her place.  I walk up to the list and see there are about 20 bodies before my friends and I.  The place is really small. I start loosing hope.  At this rate Brenda will just be hated on forever.  It is exactly 1pm when I put my name on the list and we decide to give Brenda 30 minutes... but by then we have invested too much in her and stay. 57 minutes later we are seated on the small table by the window.  People looked in and I think I may have given them the... "hahaha... I got a seat" look... I know... terrible... but... HAHAHA... I got a seat!   Our server comes up... a very sassy lady (we love you girl!) who my friends thought might be Brenda... of course... they aren't shy... first off they asked "Are you Brenda?" she let us know that she was not Brenda and that Brenda was in the back cooking away.  Ok... They saw an African American lady back there and assumed this was Brenda.  We order our food and some beignets.  First thing I ordered was the watermelon sweet tea. Brenda, this is DA BOMB!  I had 6 refills of your sweet tea. I kid you not! I ordered your corned beef hash which I knew contained onions... I am allergic to onions... but I knew I could handle a bit of wheezing to try this dish.  I popped a pill and took a puff of my inhaler and was all good. Brenda... oh sweet Jesus Brenda!  What do you put in your hash?  It was soooooooooo good!  Is it liquid crack? What? I wish I had more and the portion was huge!  And the Beignet... pardon my San Francisco arse, but I just don't go ordering things that give me visuals of their eyes looking at me.... But that crawfish beignet was so good I thought of licking the plate... but people might look at me funny.   My friends were satisfied... I was glad too because if they weren't happy they had already let me know they would blame me... and girl, I am sorry, I would have still hated on you too!  But I can now say... Brenda... I heart you!  It was worth the 57 minute wait... the "itis" that ensued and every single penny we left at your table (this place is a great deal!!!).  We liked you so much that I hate on myself for hating on you Brenda... I hate myself for hating on you. I LOVE YOU BRENDA! PS - My friend went to the bathroom and came back to tell us that you weren't the black lady in the back... she said you are Filipina (and part Creole)!  You have no idea how happy that made me. Why? Because I think my friends didn't expect that and the fact that the food was so good and you aren't 100% Creole made me say to them... "Yes!  And you liked it! I picked a good place!"  Brenda, if you were a man... I would marry you! PPS - I was review 101!  Woo hoo!

Wow! Our family was visiting SF from Orange County and our concierge recommended Brenda's. We waited for over an hour to eat on a Saturday morning but it was so worth it! I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and the Beignet Flight after reading all of the reviews and was so happy that I did! The Shrimp and Grits was definitely comfort food at its best. I loved the cheesy, bacony goodness of it. The beignets were all wonderful, although I think the chocolate and the crawfish were our favorites. My daughter ordered the Banana's Foster french toast and that also was amazing. Very sweet, almost desert like but fabulous. Watermelon sweet tea was a little bit chunky for me but very refreshing, would be perfect for a nice summer day. Will definitely be coming back to Brenda's!

minimal wait on a weekday lunch with one dining companion, sw watermelon iced tea the balance between watermelon and tea was ok, but wish it had more watermelon flavor especially since the drink will get diluted when the ice melts. besides the balance, there was this aftertaste that lingered in my mouth like an artificial sweetener. for those who like this, they refill it for FREE. peach jam ??? on the table it was puckering-my-mouth sweet. i spread it on the plain beignet to dilute it. beignets i've been craving beignets for awhile, and hoped that this would taste as good as what other reviewers have said. my reaction was - i've had better. when it arrived, first impression was they were very 3d and dusted with powder sugar on top for the sweet ones and some kind of seasoning for the savory. the color was more than just a golden brown. as for the texture, the dough was a bit drier than it should have been. it was somewhat like a donut but denser. i would say that the traditional beignet would be the hardest to make/prepare because there are few ingredients. there are no other ingredients to cover up potential flaws hence you can taste, see, and feel the texture better than the flavored ones. the one i had fell short. the apple cinnamon filling was dry. i didn't know that apples can be that dehydrated. the overly sweet chocolate beignet was basically like eating chocolate because i could no longer taste the actual dough part of it. with all the calories that the dough contains, i want to taste that too; otherwise, i would just buy a chocolate candy bar which probably has less calories. after sampling 3 sweet ones, the savory crawfish was a nice change. if only it didn't have cheese. i could taste the texture of crawfish as well as the scallions, but not so much the flavors because the cheese overpowered them. shrimp po boy a huge sandwich arrived on the plate. the shrimp battered in cornmeal was fried until the shrimp just turned pink. when i picked up the thick bread to eat, the juice from the coleslaw (which was right next to the bread) got all over it (i didn't even order the slaw). soggy bread on the bottom and buttery grilled bread on top was a bad combo for me. even with the thick bread, i could taste the shrimp, but not the tomato. fries some of the fries were rock hard and others were edible. it was like biting into a quaker oats rice cake, but most places have the same texture. service it was good though i felt rushed in the beginning when different wait staff came to take our order when we weren't quite ready yet. a bit later, sw didn't notice the specials and wanted to switch her order after it was placed. the staff gladly helped out and came to the table to confirm the order. i ordered fries with the po boy, but i got plants on a plate, so someone nicely brought over a plate of fries. though it was a mistake, they indirectly admitted it, and corrected it with good customer service skills, and that isn't something that all places can do well. other the table was pretty small for the huge plates of food, so i had to put most of the stuff on the bench i was sitting on, but that is usually the case for most tables set for 2 in san francisco. it was noticeably worse here because of the portion size. the bathroom was decent. food: 2 stars service: 1 star

Brenda, your food has hit my soul. And now my soul craves your pillowy beignets. I could inhale a dozen of your chocolate beignets right now, and afterwards, carve lines with the fallen powdered sugar and snort it up. I wonder if Dr. Drew has a program for beignet addiction.

For any NOLA natives wandering about in San Francisco. Brenda's is definitely a place to check out. The feel of home hits you right when you walk in. The smell of andouille cooking, with the sound of Rebirth playing, while the waitress greets you with a smile from ear to ear. All the while Brenda herself is in her chef's apron working hard to serve you right. This place has as much great food as it does soul.

This restaurant actually makes me happy I work in the Loin, which is a miracle. Usually, its a lunch-time destination but this weekend, my favorite girls and I decided it was necessary to have a beignet flight. We waited in the cold for an hour and a half- and it was worth it. My omelet was wonderful, the grits were perfect, and the sweet tea? I almost tried to steal a carafe and take it home with me.

Brenda's is by far my favorite restaurant I've been to in the city (granted I don't get out much). I'm a pretty impatient person, so normally I will go somewhere else if the host tells me it's a two hour wait. Brenda's is the exception to that. I will wait for Brenda's because it is pretty much an orgasm in my mouth. The crawfish beignets are to die for. The croque monsieur is amazing. I've also had the hangtown fry which wasn't bad either (not that big a fan of oysters, but still delish). I would say, please go here and try the best food SF has to offer, but please stay away... Don't increase my wait in line ;)

I recommend getting the unique dishes (skip the french toast and other Americanized breakfast food cuz u could get that everywhere). I had the crawfish beignets. They're very tasty but a bit too salty. The gumbo had a really strong kinda burnt flavor that i didn't care for too much. Other than that, I think coming once in a while is enough for me.

Brenda's was really good!  My boyfriend and I each had a cornmeal battered shrimp poboy with fries ($9.50) and we split a crawfish beignet ($2.50).  It ended up being the perfect amount of food for us to eat and have some leftovers.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the breading was slightly spicy but really good.  It came with pickled watermelon, which was an interesting flavor.  Lucky for me I have a garbage disposal of a boyfriend, so he finished off the rest of that for me.  The fries were good, but I've never had bad fries.  Next time I'll try to coleslaw for a change of pace.  Definitely recommend Brenda's!

I accomplished my mission of trying brunch both here and at Mama's over my winter vacation. I think the win goes to Mama's for their Monte Cristo sandwich, but Brenda's definitely has some highlights. Both restaurants are similar in that the actual restaurant is extremely limited in seating and is cramped. Come here early and come with groups no larger than four. As for the food, anyone who comes here has to try the beignets. These are basically donut-like hot pockets filled with delicious goodness. If you get a flight of beignets, you get four different flavors to try: plain, apple-filled, chocolate-filled, and finally, crawfish-filled. The first three are topped with powdered sugar on top and the last with cayenne pepper. Be careful to not inhale this as it will cause you to cough profusely. My favorite of the group is the chocolate. It's rich and creamy and reminds me of Nutella in texture. I'm sad to say that my least favorite is the crawfish. I really wanted to like this, but it had a very fishy aftertaste to it. I heard they usually don't taste like that, so it could be a one time thing. We also tried the French toast with butter pecan syrup. I think this plate was the highlight of the meal. It was more so the butter pecan syrup than anything else. They should put this syrup inside a beignet and you will have yourself a new menu item. That syrup would go well with anything. As for my meal, I went for the croque monsieur, which is basically a French ham and cheese sandwich. It was very crunchy with a nice helping of Gruyère cheese both inside and on top of the sandwich - kind of like a cheese melt. I thought the sandwich did lack some flavor - it was more of a snack, than a meal plate. It was served with a generous helping of fries. Dennis L. and Heidi C. chose better flavor-profiles with the pork chop with sweet potato hash and the catfish po boy respectively. The pork chop was great with the sweet potato, but it was less of a hash and more of a mush. Went great with the pork chop, but resembled baby food as a standalone. The catfish was fried perfectly with a delicious dressing/sauce to go with it.   Is it worth the 45 minute wait for a table? Maybe, if it's your first time and you love beignets. All it would take for me to come back is a plain beignet with a side of that butter pecan syrup.

My bf and I waited an hour. He commented on how calm and collected I was because normally  I wouldn't put up with it. I turned to him and said "it will be well worth it".  I had the HANGTOWN FRY with egg whites only and a biscuit....it's what you absolututely positively have have have have have to get. It's thick chunks of bacon, scallion and oysters that have been drenched in that same breading they use for the catfish.  We shared a bowl of gumbo and I jabbed my fork into one of the three crawfish beignets my boyfriend had. All washed down with watermelon sweet tea. Brenda's French Soul Food=Heaven. =)

BOOOOOOOO!!!! I feel TOTALLY Dupped. I am just mortified that I had spoke so highly of this place and brought out of town friends here and made them wait over an hour for this joke of what was supposed to be a delicious special meal. So the hubbs and I get there early, prepared with magazines and some water to sit in the sun and wait for our table. We were being treated to lunch by my god father from New Port and his wife whom we hadn't seen for almost a year. They are foodies, they are very well to do and can eat anywhere they wanted and let us choose the location. We told them about Brenda's and they were excited to try something different and we were all realllly looking forward to some brenda's french soul food. We'd kept eyeing the menu over and over during our wait. I'd decided on the sloppy jane, and we'd all kind of decided what we were going to get, most of them from the lunch menu since it would be close to 2 when we were seated. Well we were sadly informed that they only serve the brunch menu on saturdays. Crap, first blush of the day for me since we were planning on meeting for LUNCH, he'd already had breakfast earlier in the day. -1 star. Shoot, ok, well the brunch menu still looked good. I decided on the shrimp po'boy since it was it was on the top eats list. The hubbs got one of the specials the catfish eggs benedict. My godfather (already of having breakfast, eggs etc.) asked for just a plate of catfish (since it was part of the special) no problem the waitress said. His wife got the croque monsier. The Croque Monsier was a good choice and she was happy with it. My po'boy sandwich was just some fried shrimp, white bread, shredded lettuce, 2 sliced tomato's and their sauce, then I went with the side of fries which were pretty much just frozen skinny fries with no salt or flavor. HOW on earth this got on the top eats of all of the city I have NO idea! -1 more star The hubs eggs benedict was overcooked and the eggs were too hard and biscuits were extra dry and just really not good. Not enough sauce, the whole dish was just dry. -1 more star But the worst was my god fathers dish, the catfish. They literally were two tiny pieces of fried cat fish pieces. The tiny pieces that were intended to go on the eggs benedict, oh about 2" by 1" in size. Yes, only two on a big place with a cup of sauce. Ohhhh my gosh. I was just really really embarrassed I'd made such a big deal about how well known this place is, and how wonderful the food was going to be blah blah blah. We left really quiet, which is the opposite of how you leave places you love. You know the drill, 'Oh my gosh', 'I'm so full', 'why'd I eat all that!?' rubbing the belly, wisihing you hadn't of stuffed all of the goodness into your faces etc. We had none of that because no one cared to eat every possible bite because it just wasn't good. I am very very bitter about this food and it's making me totally re-evaluate my trust and faith in my fellow yelpers. It wouldn't have been as bad had I of just went with the husband and wouldn't have put my foodieness knowledge and reputation on the line brining a loved one here whom seldom comes to the city who can afford to eat a gary danko's every day of his if he so wished. But i brought him to the ghetto to eat a ghetto crap place. Ugh. I'm just so annoyed with the entire meal i cant rant about it enough.

Dear God, Thank you for bringing Brenda into this world to cook for us.  Thank you for bringing her to San Francisco, so I can indulge in her Andoullie and Cheddar omelette while sipping my Watermelon Iced Tea.  Thank you, dear God, for creating begniets and the possibility of filling them.  And most of all, thank God for Yelp because that is how I found this place.   Amen. We waited a while around 1pm on Friday (about 30 minutes) to get a table.  This place is teeny tiny.  There are about 15 small tables.  You actually have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and it's amazing that they only have that space to prep and cook in!!  Props Brenda!! The food here was spectacular, although not low in calories (never my goal I suppose).  My husband had red beans and rice with andoullie, while I stuck with the prementioned omelette.  The omelette came with a cream biscuit that was heavenly.  Each table also has homemade strawberry jam which was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  There is some type of spice in it that I can't put my finger on, but would love to put in my mouth on a more regular basis.   I was full, but I couldn't leave without a begniet flight.  This included a plain powdered sugar one, a semisweet chocolate filled one, a green apple and cinnamon one, and the crawdad begniet.  The crawdad one was savory with lots of cheese...but it was almost a little too much for me.   We finished the sweeter versions and waddled out into the sunshine. I would wait at least 2 hours and feel that it was completely worth it. I also can't wait to try the peach cobbler pancakes with vanilla creme fraiche.  And if I ever see chocolate ship banana bread french toast as Anna G. mentions, I'm sure I will have to move closer to Brenda's in order to survive.

4 stars for the crawfish beignet! we waited 2 hours before being seated (understandable due to high volume of hungry customers). -Crawfish beignet as appetizer (comes in 3pcs)-fresh, filling and hot. It hit the taste buds.. -BFC -way too crunchy and hard to bite. Eating the BFC was like eating shrimp.. gotta break the hard shell to get to the good stuff... -Chicken Etouffée (as suggested by the waiter). It wasn't super good or super bad. The portion size was slightly smaller than expected and it looks more like a soup than an entree. It was filling due to the fat and oil content. The hostess was very attentive in terms of managing the wait-list. The waitress/waiters seem to enjoy working there as I see smiles on their faces. dunno about the kitchen staff though.. If I were to go to Branda's next time around. I'd just get the beignets togo.

We arrived here around 1:15 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon and waited a little over 45 minutes to be seated.  While waiting, I couldn't help but think, "The food better blow me away."  It turned out that it was worth the wait.  I ordered the sweet watermelon iced tea, plain beignets, and shrimp po boy and they were all DELISH!!  I also had a few bites of their biscuit and it was very tasty as well.  Service was pretty good and they were always on top of it with the refills.  The place is TINY though!  And bring lots of quarters if you drive there.  Metered parking is only an hour, so I had to feed the meter a couple of times.

This place can only fit like 8 people, it's so small and it's in the tenderloin, which is shady and kinda scary, BUT THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!!! Food: 1) Tried all FOUR different types of stuffed donuts: chocolate, apple, crayfish, and plain: OMG, they were all SOOO GOOD! I don't even like donuts OR FRIED food but this was something WORTH splurging some calories and taste buds on!! Especially the crayfish donut! The apple one was really good too. The chocolate one got a little too sweet for me. And the plain one was....well, plain. But definitely order this if you come!!! 2) Veggie Omelet: AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!! Just the right amount of veggies and cheese and it absolutely melted in your mouth! 3) Grits: it's ok......nothing special. I don't think I'm a fan of grits. 4) Shrimp and carmelized onion omelet: SUPER TASTY TOO! 5) Fried potatoes: YUMMY! It was seasoned very well!!! 6) biscuit: I don't even like biscuits, but this one rocked my socks! 7) wheat toast: came already buttered....not a big fan of butter so this wasn't too cool 8) homemade strawberry jam: OMG! SO GOOD!!! 9) watermelon iced tea: Perfect amount of watermelon flavor and not too sweet either! Loved it!! Service: SUPER nice! I felt like they were a big pushy on making you eat faster, but that's because there's a LONG line of people trying to get in and get a table and considering they can only seat like 8 people in the restaurant, I can understand their urgency to nudge us to eat a bit faster. Atmosphere: Like I said, very small, but this also makes the place super cozy. I liked the music they played. And it had a very lazy, comfortable, "enjoy your brunch" kinda vibe. I liked it! Price: Everything we got came out to be around ~$20 a person. A bit pricey and WORTH IT!!! TRUST ME!!

This place is one room that fits only like 15 people max, so be prepared to stand in line if you're not here early like within an hour of opening. A breakfast of fresh beignets and coffee is just divine. One beignet for $5 or a flight of four for $8? That's an easy choice, but I do wish they were all four crayfish beignets because those were the best. The chocolate one was just messy and the chocolate was just okay. The apple one was good because the apples were spiced and nicely caramelized. The plain one was great for dipping in coffee. Don't forget to check the specials written on the mirrors and the chalkboard outside!

Hey, a line outside already at 9:15am on a cold and wet day.  However we were seated at the counter in about 15 minutes.  Be aware-when the place is packed, the noise level can be deafening.  Had the delightful flight of beignets and thoroughly enjoyed the crawfish one.  If we come back, I'll be ordering this again!  Brenda's grits and biscuit were the best I've ever tasted but for some reason, my veggie omelet was missing the creole sauce (which was still OK but lacked that punch I was expecting)  Great wait staff as they were attentive to your needs, refilling your coffee several times during the meal.  Hubby's expectations were a little bit lower as he's always been a Cafe du Monde beignet fan. One other thing-bring plenty of quarters.  You'll be running out to feed the meter (only a hour limit) at least once during your meal.

I never thought I would get a taste of the best beignet I had since New Orleans, LA. This is a must go to place for brunch or even lunch! Although I've yet to taste their lunch, I have no doubts that it will not be unsatisfying to my taste or expectations. My beau and I ordered a sampler, if you will, of all the available beignet's you can taste! They had plain, chocolate filled ghiradelli, cinnamon apple, and crawfish, which I might add was quite splendid with so many flavors to make you go 'mmmm'. Then I ordered the Andouille cheese omelette which was quite tasty. And their potatoes covered in yummy sauce. And their biscuit, which was a meal in itself might I add, was grand in that it was a pretty decent size yet light, fluffy, and crisp to leave your mouth in such delight! And to add icing to the "cake" of this place...the service was great!! Very friendly, very hospitable, and did not leave you eyeing or wondering if you would have to wave your hand for a refill of coffee. They were right on it! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the wait. We got there around noon and had to wait about an hour and a half, but well worth the wait!

since we were a group of six, we waited over an hour in the rain but IT WAS SO WORTH IT! ate brenda, where have you been all my life? we had the beignet flight and the crayfish and apple were my favorites. remember the good old days when mcdonalds used to fry their apples pies? well, brenda's apple beignet reminds me of those but with a grown up appeal. the dough was crispy on the outside and chewy inside. i loved the spice on the crayfish beignets. but wait, there's more! chicory coffee and benedicts to die for! my friends had the molasses ham and another had the catfish benedict. all were soooo good! the pancakes were as big as your head and as thick as the sunday chronicle! don't get me started on the biscuits! so flaky, creamy, fluffy and rich! i have yet to try the gumbo and the watermelon iced tea. some people get inspiration from political or religious figures, but for me, it's chef's. brenda is visible from the dining room and i loved watching her work. enthusiastic customers. super friendly staff. brenda workin the stove. stevie wonder playing in the background. sharing a meal with your closest friends. it's like you're in your family's dining room but with better food! ;)

Brenda, the owner, was head chef at Cafe Claude when their onglets were perfection so I knew I had to try out her new place.  I came with a friend who kept me waiting for over half an hour but the wait staff still sat me and gave me water.  How nice is that in such a busy, small place? The  shrimp po boy was a divine goodness of succulent shrimps battered in a crisp, golden crust rolled up in a warm roll and basted with creamy, rich pink sauce.  The lunch was heavy and bad for my figure but you know what?  I really enjoy the food coma.  Thanks Brenda!

Aside from it being stockpiled with hipsters, this place has some legitimate food.  The beignet flights (plain, ghiradelli chocolate, apple & crawfish) were pretty good.  Crawfish was by far my favorite.  I wish the beignets were either a little bit more dense or a little lighter.  It just sailed in that in between range and if it was tilted a bit more in either direction it would have been perfect.  Also, and this is more of a preference than a critique, because of the sweetness of the beignets I would have liked a dark chocolate for some bitterness instead of milk chocolate, but I'm sure others would disagree with that.  Also had the bacon and egg tartine which was pretty spectacular.

i came here for brunch last weekend.  we went around 1:30 and didn't have to wait that long but we got seated at the counter which was a little bizarre staring at ourselves in a mirror while eating.  parking wasn't too bad around here, it just gets a little brisk while you're waiting outside even on a sunny sf day. to start, we had the beignet sampler which consisted of plain, chocolate, apple cinnamon, and crawfish.  we were probably in over our heads but we managed to finish most of them.  if i had to rank them, i would say: plain (simple but really good flavor with just powdered sugar) crawfish (savory with a red cayenne pepper mix on top and cheddar cheese with the crawfish inside) apple cinnamon (a little too much cinnamon for my taste) chocolate (the description sounds better than it actually tasted, i say they should use nutella instead) we were a little ambitious and ordered 2 entrees on top of our huge appetizer.  so i would recommend you share an appetizer if you come with a friend and share an entree. shrimp grits: great hearty flavor with lots of cheese in every bite with a decent amount of shrimp. eggs benedict with molasses ham: eggs benedict is my favorite brunch dish but i was quite disappointed with this one from brenda's.  the ham soaked in molasses changed the color and flavor of the ham which made it way too sweet and changed the flavor of the whole dish.  the biscuit underneath was really good and i could taste the butter in every single bite.  sadly, the eggs benedict tasted better with just the biscuit, egg, and hollandaise sauce. maybe next time i will try the gumbo and stick with the beignets. :)  brenda's is definitely work checking out for brunch but don't listen to all the hype.

As if Brenda's really needs another review. I don't really see a point in rating a place that already has a couple hundred reviews (let alone 2,056) but I cannot rave enough about the crawfish beignets! They're so delicious. Wish I could say the same about the sweet beignets but sad to say, those were were just alright. Then again, I highly prefer savory foods over sweet foods. The shrimp+goat cheese omelette was also amazingly tasty. Watermelon iced tea was super refreshing. Must try the shrimp and grits next time.

Not impressed by this place at all.  We waited too long for average food and bad service.  The two of us got seated before a table of five and then proceeded to wait until after their orders were in and their coffee was served before I had to finally hail down a waitress.  I asked her if she could take our order and she said, "Um, yah, I guess that's my job."  Boo!  The beignets were really good but they are not worth the hour + wait or the nastiness.

Went to lunch today with two others and had a horrible experience. We sat down and ordered at around 12. Forgot to tell our waitress that we had to leave by 12:40 so I asked the hostess if we can still rush it. The hostess rudely rolled her eyes at me and told me if I'm in a rush I shouldn't "course it". But whatever at least she was helpful enough to get our order through, or so we thought. It was 12:20 and our food still did not come out. Asked the Hostess and she said its done and coming out. 12:30 came and another sweet waitress noticed and rushed our order saying there was confusion. We still think the hostess screwed over our order pretty badly and maybe on purpose? Food was good but totally rushed and was not a good experience. Three stars for the good food and other great staff.

Hearty, soulful, delicious. You can tell that Brenda loves what she does and knows how to do it too. I had eggs, potato hash and a biscuit. All good. Yeah, some of you may be thinking eggs is eggs, a monkey could do it. No. Really, if you can't manage a simple egg scramble, you should get out of the restaurant business. Brenda on the other hand, CAN manage an egg scramble and then some. On this visit, accompanying my scrambled eggs were flaky buttery biscuits and equally tasty potatoes. Breakfast potatoes are pet peeve #237. If you can't manage to season breakfast potatoes enough so that they can stand on their own, then really, you should get out of the restaurant business. So far through our breakfast,  Brenda's has done a fine job. And then my hubby and me ordered the apple cinnamon beignets. They were simply fantastic. We cut into them and then watched enamored, as the cinnamon apple filling started to ooze out. And then as I bit into the crunchy exterior, and began chewing the soft, billowy warm dough, seasoned with the apple filling I began to do that thing I know I do when something I eat is extremely delicious. I start bobbing my head up and down in a nod to an unasked question, just completely enjoying the flavors and textures in my mouth. Totally unaware of how much of a food geek I am being. I'm surprised I didn't start pointing at the beignets and start smiling foolishly. Or did I? Anyway, let's just say that the decor (stylish and warm), the service (attentive, efficient) and most certainly the food, has already left me yearning for more. Lunch is next and I can't wait to try the other beignets listed (chocolate, crawfish and of course plain), the poboys, and the specials of the day listed on mirror. Maybe we'll get lucky like we did today and not have to wait in line. Although by looking at the other reviews, we may have been just freakishly fortunate to walk in and sit down wherever we pleased.

there's something about soul food and brunch that go hand in hand together, like fred and ginger, the empire state building and the chrysler.  (see Screen Door in portland, OR) or maybe it's just me.   This is a small place, but cheerful, and with some serious menu items that pack a wallop...fantastic plates of tastiness masquerading as your mild mannered everyday brunch soul food morsels.  eat here-.your stummick will thank you and then some.

Brenda's is fabulous! The staff is friendly in dealing with everyone buzzing around, but service is just as it should be. The music is an awesome mix of soul, jazz, and funk, which totally fits in with the place. I had assumed it's a pandora station, but it's apparently just the owner's ipod. But of course one goes to Brenda's for the food. The goat cheese omelette is heavenly--definitely my fave. I'd been worried that some of the spicy things might be a little too much for my wimpy palette (I'm about a 3 in terms of spice tolerance), but they were in fact perfect. Obviously, the lines can be brutal, but the recent expansion has ameliorated those problems.

3/08 Update- We've now been back to Brenda's several times so I'm upgrading it from 4 stars to 5. Their pancakes are awesome. As a special they sometimes have an upside down pineapple pancake and it was buttery and perfectly caramelized. Definitely no syrup needed. I can't wait to try the sweet potato pancake. __________________________________________________­____ Everything we ordered was excellent.  Worth the wait as long as it's under 20 minutes.  Started off with the sweet watermelon tea, not too sweet but plenty of flavor and very refreshing.  Ordered the oyster and bacon scramble and black eyed peas with andouille sausage. With the scramble I ordered the potatoes instead of the grits which was the only regret because the potatoes were soggy and from listening to some of the other people around us it sounds like the grits are their specialty. The biscuit that came with the scramble was excellent and perfect with the peach and ginger jam. The black eyed pea dish was also savory and filling and tasted even better with the hot sauce that's on the tables. We were going to pass on the beignets after our meal, but after watching everyone around us devouring them we decided we had to give them a try also. We ordered the apple beignet based on the waitresses recommendation and they were excellent. You get three per order and the apples were flavorful and the dough was fried with the right texture- not cakey, but not as light as a doughnut.

The wait is over, after all the talk and reviews I've heard and read I finally made my way to Brenda's.  It lived up to all the expectations!  We started with the Apple Cinnamon Doughnuts, which were unlike anything I've ever had before, so delicate and delicious.  The Granola Pancakes with Vanilla Creme also hit the spot and were new and interesting.  You must also try the Watermelon Ice Tea, OMG, so good!  We had great service too, some of the best service I've had in a long time.  Our server was so friendly, down-to-earth, and cool.  Well Brenda's may be small in size, I think it's the perfect size!

My girlfriend (who is a Louisiana native) and I stumbled upon this gem while visiting San Fran.  Must try: the Beignet flight.  A sampling of French doughnuts - one plain and the rest stuffed with either gooey chocolate, spiced apples or savory crawfish.  I also highly recommend the perfectly seasoned shrimp and grits.  Bonus points for Abita Strawberry - a rare find outside of the South.

we got a beignet flight for the table and cut them in fours. it was a smart idea so everyone could have a taste of all the types. out of the 4 types, i like the plain, apple, and crawfish. the chocolate was my least favorite bc it was a little too much. eating beignets - coffee is a must! i was greedy and ordered a whole plate to myself - not a smart idea. it was too much dough after the 3rd one. on a scale of 1-10 [10 being the best]. i have to give them at 7.5. i love the idea of having fillings inside my beignets but the dough itself was lacking. i'm more critical bc i grew up in New Orleans. Cafe du Monde beignets are the best. beignets are suppose to be thick and puffy. their plain one was pretty flat. since i only ordered the beignets, i can't say a whole lot about the other items on the menu but everyone else was very happy about what they ordered. here are some approvals: shrimp omelette with goat cheese eggs benedict porkchops + eggs french toast the things i did try off of others' plates. the biscuit was a nugget of buttery flaky goodness and the strawberry jam was amazing. the grits creamy and buttery. the sweet potato hash was actually savory and seasoned with goodness. watermelon tea. it was raving on everyone's review on yelp. it wasn't my cup of tea though. i like watermelons. i like watermelon favor Jolly Ranchers. i don't like watermelon juice, i guess. it's fresh for sure. it's a tiny hole in the wall place so don't be like us and come with a party of 7! unless, you want to wait over an hour. the place is more for parties of 2. the staff is super nice. they were accommodating and understanding. good service. it's a bit of a wait but worth it all. yummmmmmmmmm.

3 stars for  a nice andouille omellette with good home potatoes; and yes the biscuit is good, if sublime. It wasn't that crowded at 830am this morning yet, I waited 25 minutes for my breakfast, oh well quality costs.On to the omellette, it contained a good amount of andouille and upon closer inspection, revealed that the andouille was full of fat globules-- no wonder it's so flavorful. The cheese in the omelette, appeared to be orangish and very runny , I think they used Kraft American cheese in the omellette, taste confirmed :it was bland tasting cheese. However , they grind their coffee beans and you can hear the grinder grindin'  HooRay!! the coffee is excellent tasting. Smoky and rich with very good body. It's a small place and if you come alone, you may be asked to sit on a stool , sitting against the wall,where you will eat on a 12 inch shelf. Well, there are 8 stools. Since you came alone, you get to look at yourself and eat in a cramped place, not a great way to enjoy a $13.00 breakfast omelette, hungry eaters will spend $20 for breakfast. Customer service was very good.  The tables looked much more comfortable. Decor: eh. Should you need to use the restroom, you will be directed thru the narrow passage way directly thru the kitchen. I walked carefully as the floor was slippery for some reason. This neighborhood is located in a sketchy area: that's why they close at 3 pm . Duh !

Thank g*d for take out! I went to Brenda's for the very first time for lunch today. It was 12:15pm and the waiting list was six parties and counting. I did the smart thing and ordered to-go. Got to try the crawfish beignets and the fried oyster poboy. I didn't know the beignets came in threes so needless to say my "lunch" was very heavy! The beignets were good, could use more filling though. The poboy was fantastic! Their breakfast options all looking mouth-watering and highly tempting. I'll save them for my next visit and thereafter...

The food is pretty good. The beignets are ok. Not great, not bad. And not the best ever. But they will suffice. The coffee is chicory. If it's too bitter for you, dump large amounts of sugar and cream in it - you won't be able to tell the difference. The service tends to be reflective of your attitude. If you're nice, they're nice. If you're an ass, well...

We had a fun breakfast on Sunday morning - beignets, followed by Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict and Crispy Pork Belly with Cheese Grits and Poached Egg.  Yummy.  Oh yeah, and spicy Bloody Marys.  We were told there was a one hour wait (about 10:00am on a Sunday morning), but when we were willing to sit at the counter, we were seated immediately.  We actually liked the counter a lot - it was a great spot for people-watching in the middle of the restaurant.  We'll be back the next time we're in SF.

It was a toss up between that and the Catfish Po Boy. Someone next to me had the Pork Belly which looked tasty, especially if you like cheese. It looked like it was floating in a bowl of cheese. The beignets looked amazing as well.

so, hilariously, my college buds and i cautiously sipped our watermelon iced teas for the first 15 mins we were at brenda's til we realized there were free refills and then began inhaling them-- i probably went through 4-5 glasses before our meal was done.  i have never had a fried oyster that i enjoyed, but for some reason, keep trying and trying in hopes that some day my oysters won't come out dry and chewy and resembling gerbil scat.  today was that day. (actually i went to brenda's yesterday but it seems weird to say "yesterday was that day,". . .maybe not that weird.  up to you.) i had the hangtown fry-- a fried oyster and bacon scramble.  isn't that just insane?  it's like the bacon of the sea, paired with. . .the bacon of land.  and after gorging myself on beignets (and yes the crawfish one IS the best), i was just disappointed i didn't have any more room to finish my whole flaky crusty biscuit.  i instinctively started to wrap it up to put in my purse, but felt embarrassed because i was the only chinese person at the table and white people get creeped out by that kind of thing in my experience.

Oh boy! Po'Boy! Ah the king of sandwiches is now present in my lunch neighborhood. For those of you who have spent time in NOLA you understand how powerful the Po'Boy is. So when I found out that the new lunch/brunch spot half a block from work was serving up these gems I was locked into it's tractor beam and called in a to go order immediately. Yum. Very tasty Po'Boy. It is by no means the PO'Boy at the Acme Oyster house. That is basically a loaf of bread with a million delicious fried shrimp shredded lettuce and remoulade all over the place. But I am thankful for the scale back in size here, otherwise I would be snoozing at my desk instead of writing this review. (Yeah working is not really an option I want to explore today thanks though) Anyway the shrimp were very tasty coated in the appropriate amount of corn meal dredge and lovingly deep fried so as not to be overcooked and rubbery, lettuce and tomato were applied correctly and the remoulade was thick and tasty, though it could have used a little more kick. Fries were a fine side but I think next time I will go for the slaw. The real winner here though is the watermelon tea. Yummy. It is sweet be forwarned, but man is it good, it comes out a big ole jar that has hunks of watermelonm and mint leaves swimming all around. Really delicious though I can't help but think how a little Maker's Mark would make it perfect....... Great little addition to the hood. Can't wait to have breakfast. Too bad they aren't open on the weekends!

Amazing food and southern hospitality. The crab beignets were incredible. The fried chicken is to die for and you can order it by the piece, specifying thigh or breast, etc. I love that!! This restaurant has all of the best elements of southern cooking without the bad ones- there was no greasy overcooked food anywhere. The green beans were absolutely cooked to crispy perfection. I want to go back and try everything on the menu. Just don't try to stick to a low carb diet when you get here. It's not going to happen.

I've eaten here for brunch twice so far. This place always seems to have an hour wait before you finally get seated (and its true they won't seat you until your whole party is there), but boy, is it worth it! The beignets are a must... the crawfish and chocolate ones in particular are absolutely delicious. They make the best eggs benedict. I had it with the catfish and it was really delicious. My friend tried the pulled pork one, and gave me a bit of it, and while I tend to hate pork, they made it very tender with some really interesting and very delicious spices. The biscuits of the benedict are to die for... as my friend said, "you can taste everything!" layered together there. I also had the granola pancakes which was also really good (but admittedly nothing as extraordinary as their eggs benedict or beignets!). Everything my friends and I had ordered also came in a very large size, so you will definitely be stuffed, and satisfyingly so. My friend also got a watermelon iced tea here, which I'll have to try next time, interesting! Highly recommended! Yum yum yum!!

One bite! That's all folks. We waited outside on a cold SF morning for an hour and 1/2. Once we got inside, I had this feeling of victory like I just hustled the toughest night club bouncer and I was ready to get down! We got the apple cinnamon beignets and they were pretty delicious even though I didn't really know what to look for considering that was my first time having one. The watermelon sweet tea was refreshing and subtle in sweetness. I got the eggs benedict with fried cat fish and THAT was all I needed. My one bite to justify waiting for the longest time. The poached egg on top a crispy piece of cat fish on a hearty biscuit with a spicy hollandaise sauce all with a side of buttery, creamy yellow corn grits. BAM! Just like that and it was gone. All in all my experience was pretty excellent. After we paid, I even waved good bye. Sure I was left hanging cuz when I waved no one saw me but that did not matter. What mattered was how all this made me feel EXCELLENT!

The 45-minute wait on the sidewalk of Polk Street early on a Saturday morning when the debaucherous smell of alcohol, vomit and urine lingered in the air was totally worth it for the beignets, grits and steak, and biscuits. I don't care what I do the night before, next time I'm showing up at 8am so I can stuff my face and feel full for the rest of the day. I want to go to there. Right now.

So i went to Brenda's with my brother for brunch. The wait sucked and the other people we were waiting outside with were a bit bleak and not very friendly.  But i guess i shouldn't base my experience on those fuckers. We were seated and we asked for water. I think its absurd to get a glass of water with no lemon slice or wedge in it. but thats me. the water tasted very tappy.  but its ok i should have asked for mineral water which is  my fault.  So i asked for a diet coke... and the lady brought over a canned soda. They don't have fountain drinks. Soda is pretty much my coffee. We ordered our meals. We got the beignet plater and it was amazing... i liked how they didn't bring our orders all at once. they waited for us to finish our beignets and then cleared our table and then brought our plates over. i ordered the Grillades and Grits with the biscuit and scrambled eggs. The grits was amazing. I LOVE MY GRITS! but the beef cutlets were dry and were hard to cut with the knife they had on the table. I thought it could be way more tender so when i tried to cut into it it wouldn't fly off my plate. But other than that it was was still full of flavor and was VERRRRYYY GOOD!  The biscuit was good too with their home made jam that was so good. I seriously put a bit too much on my biscuit. The eggs was cooked the way i cook my eggs so that was awesome. But the grits were good. Seriously came for the grits and wow. Its hard to find places that serve grits and not having to put your own butter and salt in it yourself. The grits at Brenda's was good as is. DAMN!!! my mouth is watering just thinking about it... I LOVE MY GRITS! 5 stars! so over all 5 stars. The food was great service was friendly and the setting of the restaurant was perfect. Classy but not too much. The people that we were waiting with that day could have used a bit of happy and a whack of the happy stick.

Heaven in your mouth if you can deal with the wait! My brother and I went at almost 2pm on a Monday afternoon, and we still had to wait (not too long, but still...). However, everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and the service was very friendly. Starters: We started off with the beignet fight, the chocolate, apple, plain and crawfish. They were all hot, with a nice fried crisp without being greasy. The chocolate was the standout, just a warm gooey mess! Gumbo: I've had gumbo a few times but never understood why everyone made such a big deal. I now understand. Brenda's gumbo is jam packed full of flavor, and has this wonderful richness and smokiness. Mmmm. definitely my favorite of the meal. Sides: Grits were another item I never understood the appeal....until now. Cheesy, buttery goodness. You melt with each bite. Also, much has been written about the awesomeness of the biscuits....all of it is true. Other deliciousness: the shrimp po'boy. Some specials we've had that were great were the pulled pork sandwich and the chicken etouffe.

Sorry to dump on the great reviews.  However, being from the South, these are NOT beignets.  To me, they are more like hollowed out cornbread.  Beignets are super light, fluffy, hollow donuts.    They should be utterly delectable.  These were strange, dense bread stuffed with things and were not very tasty. Have yet to find a creole/cajun soul food place in the bay area anywhere comparable to those in the south. Strange, but this place doesn't seem French or soul food-like.

I'm so extremely stuffed. Well, I guess it was the amount of food we ate. Here's goes the laundry list... We Shared: - The Beignet Flight - One of each of their beignets: Plain, Filled with Molten Ghirardelli Chocolate, Granny Smith Apple with Cinnamon Honey Butter, and Crawfish with Cayenne, Scallions, and Cheddar. - French Toast I had: - Chicken, Sausage and Okra Gumbo - Hangertown Scramble - Fried Oyster and Bacon Scramble with a Biscuit and Grits - Sweet Watermelon Iced Tea It might not sound like a lot of food, but sharing two plates and each of the three of us having an entree was plenty of food due to their sizable portions. If this is how they do it in the French Quarters, it's about time to take a trip down to the Big Easy. Everything about the food here is abundant: the size, the smell, and especially the flavor. This place is where to get beignets with each table littered with these deep fried and dusted french fritters. I even saw a few people pop in to take out a few of these in oil stained paper baggies. And trust me, they are that good. The savory crawfish beinget was my favorite. And whoever thought of putting fried oyster in a scramble? But man did it do the trick. The oyster seemed to compliment the sweet and savory bacon perfectly. Speaking of compliments I've got to say the creamy grits and fluffy biscuit were a great adjunct. The sweet watermelon tea was another unique specialty of Brenda's and went great with all the food. The only things that didn't stand out were the french toast and gumbo. And I was also hoping for a mimosa, but it doesn't look like they have an alcohol license. But you can be sure that these minor inadequacies aren't going to stop me from stuffing those beignets down my mouth once again....  soon. MUST HAVE: The Beignet Flight

just like Dottie's, maybe even better. very small place, so keep to groups of 5 or less of course, the specials written on the mirror wall are the best tried the beignet flight, but would pass on it b/c very thick dough rather than light the sweet potato pancakes were ridiculously good -- thick, fluffy, sweet, drizzled syrup, just incredible enjoyed the fried oyster and bacon omelette with biscuit and grits (if u like butter in your grits -- they sure load it up) the fried oyster po boy -- guaranteed hit (if u ok with deep fried) watermelon sweet tea and hash also good

The crawfish beignets are amazing.  It's really the main reason why I come, and if you're heading out here during the weekend: definitely worth just calling ahead and getting it to go.  They've renovated their space since the last time I visited last year but it's still super small -- maybe 12 - 14 tables tops!  And, there's always a line.  Getting those tasty beignets to go is the best option.

The BFC (Brendas Fried Chicken) was a highlight for me.  Perfectly cooked, crispy and tasty on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.  My dining companions both had the shrimp and grits, which I tasted and they were also wonderful.  We opened up with the oyster flight, which was good, but not wonderful.  I think the issue for me here is that I love the raw ones.  The deep fried didn't do much for me.  You don't hear me say THAT very often.   Here is some very good advice:  Don't go with a party of more than 4.  We were well behind a group of 10 on the waiting list, and we were about to order dessert when they got seated.  Brendas is wonderful and cozy, but big it isn't.  The folks that work there have to move heaven and earth to get that many seats together, so you will be out on the street watching the dog and pony show in the Tenderloin.  Also, get there before 7 or maybe try after 9.   I can't speak for Breakfast/lunch/brunch, but it is obvious that if they tackle those meals with the gusto that they tackle dinner, it's sure to be a good experience.

When: 6/15/11 dinner Location: where bums leave cigarette butts on your car.  Yup, the Tenderloin Company: the boyfriend Scene: People who are comically serious about considering themselves foodies. They've obviously found this place via yelp because of its numerous reviews, are trying to complete the infamous 7x7 list or are on a mission to create their own list. Either way, this filipino-creole chef keeps her people intrigued.   Decor: simple, bright open space. Cuisine: New Orleans soul food with a french twist Chow: fried chicken- southern fried chicken goodness. the kick ass burger- uniquely seasoned, self- stacked with veggies and served. Its no spruce burger, but interestingly tasty. craw fish beignets- doughnuts plus craw fish sounds disgusting, but is deliciously psychotic. must try brunch though... Sip: bottomless Watermelon iced tea is pretty refreshing- iced tea, fresh watermelon and mint. Damage: $26 Quick tip:  chalk board cupboards and chalk available for you to write your name and party size for the convenience of the wait staff.

I really like it when something lives up to all the hype around it. A friend told me about Brenda's a while back but they were closed when we went by. Since then I have heard quite a bit of chatter about it, so when Saturday rolled around a group of us headed over to check it out. There is a wait for weekend brunch, so if you are not into that you may want to come later in the day or on a weekday. I was with friends so I didn't mind that much, and once we got inside it was totally worth it. Food I will give Brenda's one star for their smooth strong coffee alone. As far as the actual food - it was a real challenge deciding what to order. The regular menu is pretty enticing, and then there were all these insane specials like Peach cobbler pancakes and Savory bread pudding with eggs. I finally went with one of the Specials - A Fried Oyster Po' boy with coleslaw, and yes it was as good as it sounds. The roll was buttered and grilled to perfection. I could taste the butter but the bread wasn't soggy or greasy. It does come with creole sauce. I didn't realize this and at first sight I was a little nervous that there might be too much, but it's pretty big sandwich so it was actually the perfect amount and it didn't end up dripping all over me as I had initially feared it would. My personal preference is a little more vinegar to my coleslaw, but I added some Crystol and it was perfect. My friend made sure we also sampled the Beignets. Crawfish Beignets - Seriously Delicious. Sweet Beignets - These were not my favorite. I thought the dough was a little tough and they were a little too sweet for me, but one of my buddies really liked the apple cinnamon beignet. Service These people are nice and they keep the water glasses and coffee cups full. This place may be small but it's bustling and it opens early. So kudos to this hard working staff. Tip them well. Ambiance - Comfy Cozy. We had a four top so we were good. I will say the folks at the counter did look a little smooshed though. Can't wait to go back.

I was in awe with the grits and it was so good that i plan on making this spot a regular!!! Also I loved the Banana Foster French Toast. It was one of the best french toast i've ever had! it was prefect. The dish my friend had was good as well. it makes me smile that I found this wonderful place!

see, ok, i am all about the morning-after-binge-drinking-breakfast-feast. but on the day i went here i was completely not feeling it. why oh why of all days!? the coffee was amazing, i can tell you that with certainty. we ordered beignets which were good, but a lot heavier than the ones i am used to, and by that i mean the ones from that creole restaurant in downtown disney, so you know, take that for what it is. My omelet was good, and the grits also tasted good, but again, i was about to lose my grits,(TMI?)  so i cant tell you it was beyond delicious. In short, i want to come back to this place not hung over (i know, me? not hung over? crazy!) and try this place again.

long wait (for 4) but food was worth it... especially the french toast with the warm buttery toasted pecan sauce, and the grits that we got with the egg and bacon tartine (also tasty but not necessarily a super standout). already thinking about what to get next time! tip - didn't love the coffee so maybe come with Blue Bottle in hand to drink while you wait

I'm sure this place doesn't need my review, but here it is anyway.  The shrimp po'boy cannot be beat, shrimp cooked perfectly with the most amazing slaw packed into a bun.  My only complaints are how tiny this place is and the hours - trying to hit the sweet spot of 2pm (after the lunch madness and before they close) was difficult, and took months but was definitely worth it.  I only wish I could eat more because I wanted to order everything!

Pretty great eggs with goat cheese and shrimp. Fantastic grits. No wait at 8:30 in th morning compared to the huge line in front of Dottie's. Nice service and a warm and inviting place to munch. A place that we'll return to a lot until the line extends to meet the line at Dottie's.

I saw this restaurant on the show Eye on the Bay and was so excited to see that they served beignets and I havent had one since I left New Orleans. Needless to say I was greatly disapointed and was LITERALLY sick to my stomach for the rest of the day. For native New Orleans residents THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL NEW ORLEANS BEIGNETS! My husband and I were sick for the rest of the day after eating here and will NEVER go back.

If you're going for lunch, go at 11 or after 1 PM. it gets wayyy too crowded, especially if you have more than 4 people. I ordered the friend chicken, it was pretty standard, and not oily at all. Can't go wrong. I wanna go back here for breakfast!

Beignets were very good but overall I find this place to be overrated.  Everything was very heavy, which some people might like, so I don't want to come off as a hater.  For me, I'll take a much lighter breakfast for half the price.

I didn't think it could live up to the hype and it definitely did! I know it was a complete fluke...but I didn't have to wait at all. Okay, so I guess it was 8:30, but we still thought there was going to be a wait. So that was a great start and we hadn't even ordered yet. We had coffee, watermelon iced tea, beignet flight and andouille cheddar omelet. - coffee: good - watermelon iced tea: I didn't think it was that great, it was a little funky and it just made me think about the watermelon beer at 21st Amendment mmmmm - beignet flight: all were good (well I didn't try the chocolate, but that's because I don't like chocolate - I know I'm a freak, but my friend said it was good), I particularly liked the crawfish, ohhh sooo yummmmy - andouille cheddar omelet: ehhh, the omelet itself was nothing spectacular, but I have pretty high standards when it comes to omelets or eggs in general I guess...but the sides! Ohhh the sides were AMAZING. Grits=sinfully delicious. Biscuit= flaky, buttery awesomeness. I wish I could order a biscuit smothered in the crawfish filling...yep that would be perfection!

I learned about Brenda's through a friend of mine who posted pics of her breakfast on Facebook. I went on to Yelp the restaurant and also found out it was about 2 blocks down from my work. The reviews and here say about the food were all good ones, so I thought, why not and I gave it a try!?! As I walked down Polk street I noticed a line that almost wrapped around the corner and thought to myself, I won't be able to get my lunch :( But, to my surprise and about 10-12 people ahead of me, I was seated in less than 20 min. The menu and black chalkboard was overwhelming! I wanted to try everything all at once, seriously! Instead, I settled for the Fried Oyster Po'Boy--and I do not for one minute regret my decision! It was heaven! The sandwich was pretty large and thought I wasn't able to finish it, but to my surprise I left nothing but the green leaf the slaw laid on! Wash it down with the homemade Watermelon Tea and you're good to go! Brenda's is a must go too spot and will continue to tell my friends and family to go try it out--you will not be disappointed! Oh and major major major KUDOS to Brenda for also being Filipina! Pinays REPRESENT!

I stopped by this morning to pick up coffee & chocolate beignets to bring back to work. I love the new space! They've been remodeling for awhile but I just noticed because I don't work near here anymore. At 10 am on a Wed there was no line and only a few diners. Try to go early or later in the afternoon if you don't want to wait. Or write your name on the chalkboard and take a stroll in the neighborhood. My favorites here are the chicken gumbo and oyster poboy. Check out the daily specials, they are always amazingly awesome too.

A little hole-in-the-wall that serves a terrific breakfast. I'm always looking for joints like this...especially when the food is as good as it is at Brenda's. It was cold outside...44 degrees and we had a short wait. There's not a spare inch inside the restaurant for people milling around waiting for a table or counter seat. We put our name on the list hanging in the doorway and waited 15 minutes. Once inside we were greeted warmly with good, hot coffee and friendly waitresses. Menus arrived and the tough choices began. Brenda calls her food French soul food. Yeah. The beignets looked amazing but I wanted something a bit heartier so I went with Adouille and Cheddar Omelette with sausage, cheddar, mushrooms, scallion, sauce piquant.  The omelette was served with warm, flaky biscuits and super-comfort potato hash (grits were the other option). My friend, wanting lighter fare, went with the Butter Pecan French Toast, slathered with a warm and buttery toasted pecan sauce. They were both excellent. Large helpings were too much to finish and half the french toast came home with us. Prices were reasonable, service was friendly and food was great. What's not to like? Good stuff.

this place is a solid 4-star place (for taste and service), and I highly suggest you try it out if you're in the area. but beware, you will HAVE to wait. i came here on a friday and had to wait 25 mins for a table. sure, there are quite a few people that frequent this place, but it's also INCREDIBLY small. and for me, this is where Brenda's lost points. my friend and i had to sit on stools, which isn't really comfortable because you're about two feet from the table behind you. ANYWAY, enough complaining....here's the good stuff: the food is awesome!! i love french soul food/creole dishes/NOLA cuisine...however you say, i love it. i also loved how they had a variety of beignets on the menu -- something i have never seen before, even at cafe du monde in new orleans. they were a little denser than i prefer (the ones at Angeline's in Berkeley are fluffier), but good nonetheless. my friend had their watermelon sweet tea, which he loved. and for my actual meal, i settled for the shrimp and goat cheese omlette....YUM!! but my FAVORITE part of the dish were the biscuits! i have never had biscuits so soft, crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS!! even though i'm not a huge fan of grits, i thought they were pretty good too. as for service, the waiters and waitresses were incredibly kind, and always greeted us with the warmest smiles. i also wanted them to make something veggie-friendly, which they happily did. all in love, a great find (thanks to yelp!). i'll definitely be coming back, and look forward to try the poboys! =)

i did not expect this place to be so small or to have a line on a rainy day. i also did not know that they wont seat your party until everyone has arrived soo unfortunately our wait was longer because we got there later than the other two. there is probably no more than six tables and a long booth. it was a little too squished for me because you had to constantly scoot in/out when the waitresses/people walk by. i was also disappointed that they were not serving lunch because both brunch and lunch menus were outside and i was so set on getting the sloppy josephine chicken, sausage, and okra gumbo - im not a big fan of gumbo, mainly because i dont like okra, but i did sample a little bite of it without the gumbo and it was pretty tasty. it wasn't as hot as my friend liked it to be and asked if they can warm it up a little longer and i thought it was a nice thing that instead of popping it into the microwave, they warmed it up in the oven. cajun crawfish beignets - comes in three a order. each beignet is pretty big and packed with a lot of cheese. i didnt really taste the crawfish because the cheese and sauce was soo heavy but rest assure, there are a few chunks in there. it tasted like a pretzel smothered with cheese sausage, mushroom, andoullie omelette -maybe it's because i had my heart set on the sloppy josephine that i didnt fully enjoy my omelette, but this was nothing special to me. i did like the abundance of mushrooms it came with though and the potato hash was good. i had a choice between toast and biscuit and our waitress said they are known for their biscuit so i gave it a try. i dont really know what a "good biscuit" tastes like (except those cheesy ones from red lobster!) but aside from being huge, it was nothing exceptional fried catfish sandwich - took a bite out of this, and just like my friend said, it tastes a lot like a MCD fish filet! i love catfish though, it was a good sandwich it was overall an okay experience. there isn't much variety on the menu and nothing that i saw on the brunch menu that i would want to try so i probably would not be coming back again

Had my second hungover brunch at Brenda's today. It was noon on a Monday, so we only had to wait 5 minutes. As bad as this sounds, all french fries pale in comparison to McDonald's in my book. I have never had better fries - until Brenda's. Also, when I am inebriated or otherwise exercising bad judgement, I eat bacon. I shouldn't even pretend I'm a vegetarian anymore. Brenda's weakens my self control and I ordered the tartine which was eggs, cheese and bacon on a kaiser roll. They top it with tomato bacon relish. Holy delicious.

So happy my boyfriend and I found this place on yelp! I was a little worried that it would be incredibly busy like everyone complained it was, but we arrived at a decent time on a Friday morning and were seated immediately. I had the pork belly with grits and some delicious coffee. MOUTH WATERING. I would love to eat here again and try their beignet's! I've been to New Orleans and I have to say this is better than some of the 'authentic' cajun I've had in NOLA.

We first heard of Brenda's when looking for a place to score some good breakfast. But as fate would have it the sandwich placed we traveled across the Tenderloin to get to was closed. As it was getting dark and some of the streets were not looking that inviting we headed back the way we came. We finally stumbled across a nice looking restaurant and ducked in for some dinner. Turned out the place was Brenda's. I ordered some sweet potato dish that had the taste of mardi gras and the look of a fine french dish. Just like the French Soul food slogan. Imagine that. Anyways it was delicious, my only complaint, it was a little small. But I like big portions. Luckily my girlfriend ordered the beans and rice, also delicious, and I was able to steal some of that. The dinner was good enough we decided to be "those guys" and went back for breakfast the next morning. Once again very good. A lot of reviews said there was always a long line, but we just beat the crowd and were able to get seated right away. Ordered a veggie omelette and the French toast as well as one of the bigenett we had discovered the night before. Left full and satisfied. Definitely recommend Brenda's!

After waiting 1.5 hrs in the cold (relative to SF weather) we were finally seated.  With a NOLA transplant at the table, expectations were high.  Luckily they were met.  Everything we ordered was great, exceptional points to the biscuits.  Try this place out, but not with more than a group of 4.

I might get some hate for this, but I thought the beignets were overrated. We tried them all, and given the other fatty goodness available, we agreed that they weren't worth wasting calories on. But the 45 minute wait was worth it for the grits...I love me some grits and I think these are the best I've had in the Bay...and the dense buttery biscuits. The best thing we tried was the eggs benedict. So we liked the food, meh on the beignets.

I was shocked to get parking right out front and a table right away at 10:30am on a Saturday morning.  I guess SF isn't quite awake yet - still hung over from last night's bender at Hemlock?  Anyway, husband and I shared an order of plain beignets to start.  Yummy but I wish I ate less because I could barely finish my egg & bacon tartine sandwich with grits which were both really good - just too much food.  Hub had the benedict special which he said was tasty and wished he had the grits too because he ate most of mine.  I would definitely go back to try their gumbo and possibly some other savory dishes.  Cute place - seats like 20 people max so no wonder there's a loooooong wait on the weekends for brunch.  Go early - if you're awake.

the sometimes exasperating culinary landscape of civic center/tenderloin just got exciting with the addition of this small, charming restaurant. my friend had given me the menu, and just one look at it filled me with positive vibes. my restaurant gut instinct told me that this was going to be GOOD, so i skedaddled over today and loved it.  so grateful to have brenda's within walking distance of work. given such a tiny space, they compensate with a terrific ambiance and simple, stylish decor. specials are written on the mirror, which the counter seating faces. we ordered the beignets flight sampler and gobbled down the chocolate, cinnamon apple, and crawfish beignets. they were fun and tasty. my favorite though was the chocolate one - take one bite and you hit a pool of molten chocolate. next we devoured our fried shrimp po' boy and shrimp/goat cheese/tomato-bacon relish/caramelized onion omelette with biscuit and tater hash. EVERYTHING was satisfying and well done. it's not just that the food was pleasant, delicious, and purdy to look at, but the overall atmosphere was inviting and down-to-earth too. lots of warmth, despite the grim environs right outside the door. bonus: the chef/owner is not only female, she's also filipina-creole. AWESOME. can't wait to go back to try the jambalaya, gumbo, house salad , and other creative goodies. btw - their biscuits are the most picturesque in the world.

Nice grits, tasty biscuits, perfectly cooked over easy eggs, and I do mean perfect. I had just arrived in town from texas and thought i'd get off at civic center to try this place out, it was about 8am. I walk to Brendas and its busy, but I'm alone so I sit along the counter on the mirror wall, service was good, food was just as it said it would be. I wish I had tried some of the specials, but my brain wasn't in the mood to think to much after my long journey. For breakfast in the city it was nice. Dotties is better, but I didn't want to wait 35 minutes for eggs.

Walked in at 11:00 am on a week day and there were 2 empty tables and 6 empty stools. What luck!  The biscuit is very fine and the peach jam has just the right balance of spices.

Yes!  We need more places like this here.  Delicious beignets (order the flight), cozy atmosphere, clearly a labor of love.  And unlike most popular brunch places in the city, it's worth the wait.  I must disclose that I was particularly susceptible to Brenda's charms because I'd read the posthumously published essay "What is Southern?" by culinary grande dame Edna Lewis in Gourmet that week.  A powerful combination.  Would wait for you anytime, Brenda.

My friend Ian turned me onto this place. I really love it. The nice thing about being a "freelancer" is going to Brenda's for lunch on the weekdays. The food is amazing. The servers are really sweet and they really navigate well in a cozy space. My Frenchman lives in the neighborhood and this is one of our favorite places to go. Funny that one of the last times we ate at Brenda's there was a couple next to us that was on a first date. As the check came, the guy said " why don't we split the check". He followed with " I still have to pay $10 for parking you know, so it evens out" ! The Frenchman's had a shocked look on his face. He asked me if that was normal dating behavior!

Great place my co-worker took us to for lunch! The wait was long for lunch, but people were waiting so we figured it was worth it. The black-eyed peas with sausage was delicious and worthy of my grandma. The beignets were a little heavier and tougher than I'm used to, but they were still good. My companions all enjoyed their food too.  Solid soul food that will not disappoint.

*update* I haven't been in a couple of months because i stopped living around the area. I went back and here is what Ive taken a way from it *The new wait staff is rude. (Well, dont know how new they are but i used to go once or twice a week and never saw them back then) Heres the deal: We wait for a few and the waitress comes over and says "Are you ready?" I say "I'd love a cup of coffee" and she quips "Food only. The other guy will be over for drinks later." Ummm... later. It is Brunch. It is Sunday morning. I skipped going to Peet's so I could wait in line at your establishment. The best you could do  is get me a cup of coffee. The place is so small its not like youre going miles out of your way to get it. And, even if that's not in your system, well you could have said sure and then when passing the other guy say "Hey, 3 coffees for table 8." Instead she gruffly refused. Then about 5 minutes later he comes over and says "I hear you may or may not want coffee." Um, yes, I may want coffee since thats the first thing I asked for. Sheesh. Secondly, when you're squeezing 3 people into a table built for 2 (And, I have no problem with that its a small place. Do what you got to do!) at least take all the crap off of the table so it doesnt become a noticeable hassle and roll of the eyes when you try to load 3 large dishes of food, 3 coffees and creamer on to the table. Youve got salt. pepper. sugar. ketchup. hot sauce. mustard. Bring that on command. Youre a table tent short of  being Applebees. ------------------------------------ original: Listen, there's what? 7 tables. The food is, what? Excellent and different from the usual, especially in the neighborhood. And brunch? Well, lots of SF'ers love going to brunch. Put this formula together and guess what? There wil most likely be a wait. So, suck it up people and stop being annoying. You know what youre getting yorself into. So, when the lovely host who is doing his job comes out to seat the next name on the list, dont yell "pick us" or rush up to him and say "Um, sharon party of 2 is still here". Thats not how it works. You know that. So, shutup and wait. However, we waited 45 minutes and the time flew by..... be cause we were making fun of all of you! Besides that. Yummy yummy yummy. Cute, cozy, good service, many selections and everything I had was great. NIce to see the chef opened her own place and got away from that awful "gourmet carry out" place she worked out before.

brenda, oh brenda!  i dreamed about your crawfish beignets two nights ago, and you know what i did when i woke up from that delicious dream yesterday?  i came to you and ordered not one, but TW0 orders of your crawfish beignets!  we ate an order there, then took one to go!  and do you know what?  they were a dream come true!  LoLx i've been to brenda's twice, and every experience i`ve had has been an awesomee one!  both times we came on weekdays around lunch hour and our normal wait time has been about 15 minutes, which isn`t bad considering people wait 1 - 2 hours.  parking is mostly street, so be prepared with a pocketful of quarters because it`s $3 for an hour on those stupid parking meters o.O;;  i remember when a quarter got you 3O minutes on a meter! for our first time, we both had the hangtown fry and the beignet flight, with watermelon ice teas. the hangtown fry was chocked full of juicy oysters, bacon and sausage...sOoOoOoOo good!  it also came with potatoes and biscuit.  the potatoes weren't too impressive, but the biscuit was awesomee!  buttery, crumbly goodness! the beignets were unbelievable!  the chocolate, original, and apple were delicious, but the crawfish took the cake!  deep fried and filled with gooey cheese and chunks of crawfish, then dusted with spices, i had a foodgasm when i bit into it and almost fell right out of my chair!  oh god, even thinking about it right now is making me weak in the knees!  LoLx when we came back yesterday, booboo had the fried oyster po`boy and i had the croque monsieur, in addition to the 2 orders of crawfish beignets.  the po`boy was filled with crunchy oysters, lettuce, and tomatoes, then smothered in a chipotle remoulade...so delicious! my croque monsieur was mind-blowing!  baked ham and melted gruyere on sourdough with creamy bechamel sauce...heavenly!  it was crispy, creamy, cheesy goodness!!  nomnomnom xD the watermelon ice tea was exquisite...the sweetness of the watermelon balances out nicely with the tea.  oh, and the homemade watermelon pickles were amazing.  they were a bit on the spicy side, but still really good ;D i absolutely L0VE brenda`s!  you can`t go wrong ordering here, because EVERYTHiNG is good!

unfortunately, i felt that the food looked better in pictures than they actually tasted. this place is a 3.5. after seeing pictures of beignets, i've been wanting to come here. food: - beignet flight: you get to try all 4 beignets. they have the filled ones with crawfish, chocolate, and apple as well as a plain one. the chocolate was overly sweet. apple was decent. crawfish was interesting but it was savory and sweet at the same time, which i didn't like. overall, food was good but not spectacular or special. beignets were not my favorite just because it tasted like fried donuts. the watermelon iced tea was really refreshing and best part, they are refillable.

I live near this goldmine of a restaurant.  I like to start with the  Sweet Watermelon Tea and the Crawfish, with cayenne, scallions and cheddar  Beignets. Thinking about these fun filled pockets of mouth watering joy get my taste buds  dancing.  Recently, I ate the fried shrimp po-boy and it was oh so good. yum yum!!

This little place is amazing. At 10am on a saturday morning there was an hour wait for a 3-top, but it is def worth the wait for the patient!  I had the fried oyster po boy sandwich - delicious. I tasted my friend's eggs benedict with a great twist on the hollandaise sauce w/ richy creamy grits.  The crawfish beignets were delicious and of good size.  Next time I'm going to order the flight of beignets which gives you a little taste of each type and the catfish eggs benedict.  Highly highly recommend this place!!!!  Sooooo good!  Oh one note...if you like your benedict egg yolk a little runny, tell the waiter cuz my friend's yolk was half cooked.

yup, pretty tasty. don't bother with the benedict - stick with the southern stuff. long damn wait if you don't get there early. take-out brunch? seems counter to the whole idea of brunch, but might be the only way to eat brenda's again without sleeping away my entire saturday night (don't ask) and managing to wake up at 900a on sunday.

Worth the wait.  I didn't have the beinet...so regretting it, but I was too full.  The Creole omelet was good and filling.  I wished the biscuit had more flavor.  It tasted more like butter crumbles.  Other than that, the omelet and coffee was worth the wait.  I would come back and give the biscuit a second chance to redeem itself.

I had a simple egg breakfast here and really enjoyed it. My poached eggs were perfectly runny, the biscuit was heavenly, and the service was friendly and efficient. My friends ordered the beignets, but I was too stuffed to try them, although they seemed to enjoy them a lot. I really prefer this place to other places in the neighborhood like Dottie's. If you like biscuits as much as I do, go here.

This is finger-licking-in-public worthy!  I had the po-boy and my friend had the grillades; it was worth sitting in the crowded space.  The one setback is that the place is tiny and you have to time your visit perfectly, so you can get a spot.  If you have to wait, it's worth the wait.  Their meatloaf looks off the chain too!  Happy eating!

I so love this place! I went there fore the second time today for brunch. I had a special - the catfish benedict and a half order of their sweet potato pancakes. Both very rich. The hollandaise sauce was amazing, the catfish was crispy, but not too fishy for a morning meal.. the biscuit was warm on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Perfect all around. The pancakes too, but I would definitely share those or get a half order (otherwise, you risk death, diabetes, or worse ;) Oh, and don't try to go there for dinner... they only do breakfast and lunch.

It is true what the reviews have said!  Brenda's is fantastic food!  Everything I ordered was fresh and hot.   The coffee is even better than Starbucks and just as strong!   The chocolate beignets are to die for-crunchy with excellent chocolate filling and they were not greasy.   The only downside to this place is the small size inside that can get very noisy.   The service is good, but not pushy.   The wait is worth it.

I knew there had to be an upside to living in this neighborhood, and it turns out Brenda's is it.  Although the second time I ate here the service began very rudely, the overwhelming memory from eating here will be of the biscuit - OH, the biscuit!  I would have to recommend eating here based solely on that, but it turns out that my omelette was pretty delicious.  Grits were a bit salty, and the other time I ate here I had the Beignet Flight and was not as floored, but again, these downsides are well outweighed by the deliciousness of my meal. The coffee was good, and I hear other beverages are good, too.  The service picked up later, cause we had less to do with the hostess and more interaction with a friendlier waitress. And show up early if you don't like to wait!  They do a pretty good job of getting people in and out without rushing them too badly, though.

The best part of a Sunday brunch is, in fact, the wait. While you wait for your table, hiding behind your sunglasses, or your newspaper, you get a great cross-section of San Francisco culture. The couple on your right has been up since 6:30 this morning. They have already grocery shopped, walked the dog, worked out, done some housework, and are just now rewarding themselves with brunch. The trio on your left was still up at 6:30 this morning, and the ever so faint aroma of an indulgent night wafts from them. People, this is what makes brunch so great. And then you get seated. Brenda's is amazing. No two ways about it. A flight of beignets, a watermelon ice tea, a coffee with chicory, and a catfish creole eggs benedict? WOW. The service is amazing, the prices are beyond fair, and above all the food is very special.  It's rich, and I did walk sideways for three hours after my brunch, but i lay that blame on me. After all, I ate enough for three people. If you haven't yet gone, go.

Welcome to San Francisco- Land of good food! I headed to Brenda's, with all my suitcases, straight from the airport for breakfast. The walk from the Civic Center BART station was what I would call "interesting"... made many metal notes to not walk the area again...even at 9am... The wait was about 15 minutes (3-4 groups in front of me right when tables were about to turn). The menu was posted outside, and specials were outside as well, so I narrowed my order for maximus speed on getting my food. I was seated at a stool facing a mirrored wall and ordered the beignet sampler (crawfish, apple, regular, and chocolate) $8, after not being able to choose sweet or savory, and the daily special of oyster and farmed bacon scramble $11. The dish came with grits or potatoes and toast or biscuit. I went for the potatoes and biscuit. My food came pretty quickly- with the pastries arriving first. When I saw their size I knew I was in trouble. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. The craw fish was a great hot savory meal starter. The original beignet was perfect in flavor, tenderness, and consistency. I saved the other two for later in the hotel room. When my main entree arrived I picked the oysters(thinly breaded) out first, knowing what the star of the dish was, and then ate some egg and potato. The bacon was a little too fatty for my personal taste. The biscuit was so tender I had a hard time not eating all of it as I was tempted to pick at my plate upon realizing I was super full. My service and server were kind and basic The afternoon after eating at Brenda's I walked, and walked, and walked to work it all off... the food was heavy and flavorful- it sticks with you for a while. FYI's~ * Write your name and how many on the list by the door for seating * Sandwiches. Po Boys, Burgers, etc are served starting at 11am * They sell sweet homemade watermelon tea * The beignets are on the large side- and do not keep!!! eat them immediately- They lose their texture and taste as they cool off * The space a Brenda's is VERY small- does have more than a few seating options by it was cramped- nothing bigger than a 4 top

this place is STUPID FANTASTIC. homespun flavors and excellent service. no frontin', this place redefines comfort food. just simple, clean flavors that have purpose to the whole. the ingredients are fresh and the  preparation is thoughtful, the flavors are bold,  and the balance is delicate yet calculated. i love the biscuits. texture is key. these biscuits aren't masked by butter. you can taste the difference, even if you're a fan of the buttery stuff. the sauce work is masterful, and the attention is all about the food. this is really a brunch fave for me. it's small, so be prepared for a wait.

Only been twice, but was fantastic both times. The best are the grits, golden and soupy and rich; and the cream biscuits. Combined with the perfect cafe au lait (not exactly Creole, but good coffee), you've got a cheap breakfast. Everything else I've tried, which includes every beignet and two of the omelets, was perfectly delicious as well -- fluffy eggs, savory fillings, perfect temperature and just the right amount of food. Avoid the hash browns. This place is definitely a rare outpost of Southern-style cooking, although sadly it does not offer biscuits and gravy.

I came here with my whole family, including my Mississippi mother and we all enjoyed the food very much. Having grown up with homemade soul food my whole life, I knew Brenda's would either be a big hit or a big miss. To start we got the oyster flight and crawfish beignets. The oysters were by far my favorite of the night. I could have eaten just those and walked out happy. The crawfish beignets were good, but my only complaint is the crawfish was a little overcooked. Still yummy flavors though!  Also, their biscuits and watermelon iced tea are fantastic. The tea is refreshing and not overly sweet. For main course I got the catfish with crawfish etouffee, and the flavors were great. The catfish was cooked well, but the crawfish was overcooked. My dad had the sweet potato dumplings and we all tried it and loved it. The sauce on those was Amazing. The shrimp and grits were also really tasty from what I tried. The big disappointment was the jambalaya. I've had great homemade jambalaya my whole life, and this was just not good; no redeeming qualities about it.   My only complaint is that the service was okay at best. I usually do not complain about stuff like that, but they are really busy and we felt pretty ignored the entire time. Also, out of the four different servers that we had throughout the meal, only one was really friendly. How can you have a soul food restaurant and not serve that warm southern hospitality along with the food?  There was a disconnect there for me. Lastly, it's not the best place for a big group, as it's kind of a tight squeeze in there.

It's both very encouraging & discouraging to arrive at a breakfast spot for a weekend meal and see a lineup down the street. But, once the long wait was over, my two friends and I were able to sit down at Brenda's off Civic Center for one of the yummiest and perhaps most fattening soul food breakfasts I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in. Brenda's menu has so many things worth trying, and we enjoyed sampling the beignet sampler plate, which had a great combination of sweet and savory delights. The place is very small and not a great option for groups larger than four people. But, what I found very nice was the sense that even though people are waiting on line outside, the servers don't make you feel rushed. This is not a table turnover experience, but a chance to meet, greet and eat some very tasty and different types of breakfast foods you won't often find at your standard SF brunch spot. On a side note, I've also noticed that Brenda's has been catering some arts and culture events around town, and she clearly has a way with non-breakfast fare as well. YUM!

I have to admit this is the first Yelp place that I've visited that i fully agreed with everyone's raves. Yes, the wait is awful, but oh so worth it. We loved everything we tried: A flight of bignets --plain, crayfish filled, chocolate filled, apple/cinn filled (one of each). Fantastic!!!! the crayfish one powdered with creole spies and filled with hot spicy seafood mixture was my favorite The omelet with anduille sausage was great Even the grits, which I normally don't care for, were very good due to the ton of butter and cheese in them We also had the french toast with walnut maple sauce. It was indecently good! Something better enjoyed in private, if you know what i mean. The watermelon sweet tea was nice and refreshing. Overall, the food completely compensated for a tiny place with no ambiance and an hour and a half wait

I think my review is similar to everyone else's on here. I've heard of Brenda's... I've never been. One Saturday morning the bf and I decided to get up extra early and go get us some soul food. Extra early in our case meant 9am, so we didn't get to Brenda's till 10am and by that point the line was out the door. We waited....and we waited...and we waited....and I wondered, is this place really gonna be worth it?  Uhmm... hell yes it was!  Once inside, I realized it only sits 40 people and thus the long wait. Be patient grasshoppers, your time will come and you'll be happy you waited it out. So we sit down, look at the menu and see Chicory coffee. The bf is from the South so he practically peed his pants when he saw this. From that point on, things just got better. The coffee arrived and tasted like hearty hot Chocolate. I'm down with the Chicory from now on. Then came my dish. Oh, what a dish it was! I ordered the omelet with shrimp and goat cheese aaaand - holy mother of everything that is decent in this world - this was the most aaahmazing omelet I have ever had. The flavor practically knocked me out of my chair. The shrimp were cooked to perfection - not undercooked, not overcooked. The grilled, caramelized onions added just the right touch of sweetness to the dish. The tomatos were sauteed in some sort of buttery goodness and really brought all of the flavors together. The goat cheese topped the whole thing off on an ahmazingly high note. I will remember this omelet forever. Next time, I'll get up at 8.

Great place!!  The food was fabulous, creative, & fresh. I wanted to try everything on the menu -- the granny smith apple beignets, crawfish beignets, jambalaya, andouille sausage omelettes....everything sounded (and smelled) so good. Being there for breakfast, I had the granola fruit pancakes. The granola was cooked IN the pancakes on the griddle -- very interesting and not bad at all. We also had the banana French toast special which was just fabulous. Oh and the watermelon iced tea is a must try. It is out of the world!!!  You won't regret it. Loved the industrial-chic decor with wrought iron on the widows, and the blackboard by the door for you to scribble your party name if there's a wait (which there wasn't for us, but it was a Wed lunch). The idea was wonderfully whimsical!!!  Loved it.

Butter Grits and girls with hairy armpits! Ok, wrestling fans you need to check this place out!! The food is high quality, fresh and worth the wait. Let me give you the rundown on the items Lord Alfred Hayes and I reviewed. Beignets Sampler.... they had a fancy name for this item, but I don't recall very well nowadays; perhaps, one to many pile drivers. For those that aren't aware, beignets are a French breakfast pastry similar to a doughnut. A pile driver is when i pick up a person, flip them upside down with their head between my legs and jump slamming their head into the ground; hence pile drive. Back to the review, the sampler comes with 4 beignets (Chocolate filled, Apple Cinnamon, Traditional and my favorite Crawfish) covered with powdered sugar. Each beignet was cooked perfectly, bread was fresh, soft and flaky. If you are a chocolate lover, then you need to try the Ghirardelli chocolate filled beignet! It is very rich and thick. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate in the morning, so this wasn't my favorite. The apple Cinnamon filled beignet has a distinct and strong flavor, almost over powering. The apple-cinnamon filled insides reminded me of a apple turnover style pastry; it went very well with coffee. The plain beignet is advertised as "for the die-hard traditionalist". I'm not traditional, nor a beignet snob. I thought is was very plain and probably my least favorite (Chubby people prefer fillings). Onwards to the all star on the plate..... The Crawfish beignet was stellar, simply marvelous! A standout in color with a hot cayenne coloring. This beignet was the only warm filled pastry, containing a medley of melted cheddar cheese, crawfish, scallions and cayenne spice. I'm not a big fan of crawfish, but this is so well prepared that you have to make sure and try it! Don't let this beignet pass you by. French toast- Who doesn't love french toast in the morning. Lot's of powdered sugar topped these fluffy pieces of deliciousness. This style of french toast was not the big fat thick pieces that you might find elsewhere, but the dish did not disappoint. The plate did come with a homemade pecan syrup. It was good, but nothing to go back for on it's own.  To me, french toast is french toast, so there isn't too much to say. It's good, not great. On to the great stuff... Eggs Benedict Brenda style was awesome!! This is not your traditional Eggs Benedict; I'm an Eggs Benedict snob and this place does it right! There were 3 available styles, but i will just share my experience with the Fried Crawfish. I chose the potato hash as my side to go with the amazing eggs benedict (a side note on the potatoes: good homestyle potato hash with a few spices. Big chunks of potatoes and very filling). The hollandaise sauce was a definite in house preparation made from scratch. It was full of flavor and had a reddish-yellow look as opposed to the traditional yellow. It had all the taste of regularly prepared hollandaise sauce plus 'something' extra. Wish I could tell you, but i just don't know. What i do know is that the flavor was more impressive then my massive biceps! I piledrived the heck out of these bendedicts. Just as amazing were the biscuits prepared with the eggs benedict. WOW!! You will want to put a Cobra Clutch Grip on them biscuits because they are that good! Seriously delicious. Homemade, fluffy, soft, thick and a real treat. The reality is just about anything could have been placed between the biscuits and hollandaise sauce and it would have tasted great. The dish called for fried crawfish in this case and it did not let down. It could of been cauliflower (yuck) and I would of still loved the meal!   I know..... we ordered a crap load of food! Sausage and cheddar omelet... MMmmmmm, im a big omelet person. These aren't the biggest, but it was good stuff. Plenty of melted cheese complimented the southern style Andouille sausage and mushrooms. The side dish was the house made buttered grits. I'm not at all a grits guy (texture is too much like oatmeal for my liking), but my partner in crime and waitress (biased i know...) swear by it. I tried it and it was better then i remember grits tasting in the past, so that might say something. Just don't put to much stock into opinion on the grits. Back to the omelet.... mmmmmm, yummy. However, i will say this.... the salsa on top of the omelet seemed store bought or just generic. Not a big fan and would of preferred it on the side or just not included. If your gonna have salsa, make it spicy! Drinks-- Watermelon tea was a pleasant surprise. Sweet and full of watermelon flavor. I would imagine this can be turned into a great summertime adult drink! Add one part vodka, one part sugar and you're set :) Other drinks were coffee and OJ. Nothing special there so im moving on. Wait Staff: Pleasant, attentive and knowledgeable. CONS: Small, tiny hole in the wall. Long wait. Get a bigger place!!

I suggest going early in the morning because it gets crowded. However, they are renovating so there should be more space available soon. Customer service was great. Our waitress kept checking on us and refilling our drinks. I high suggest trying the crawfish beignets. There is a beignet sampler which consist of plain, chocolate, crawfish, and caramel apple but honestly they didn't taste that great so I would just go along with the crawfish. The sweet potato pancakes are good too but super sweet especially since the syrup is brown sugar so ordering an omelette or beignet to balance out the sweet n salty taste would be good. The shrimp grits was also good but it did have a lot of cheese.The water melon iced tea is also good with free refills! As for parking its in the tenderloins so it's all metered and its not that scary. Enjoy!

The oyster po boy sandwich was one of the best I've had.  The chicken jambalaya was not great though.  I thought it tasted a little too "ketchupy."  The beignets were good, but I've had better.  It's getting 4 stars for the po boy.  I'd like to go back and try the pancakes and biscuits.   I went on a Friday around 1:45pm.  The wait was about 15 minutes, so not terrible.  Good service, but my chair kept getting bumped by waiters and other passing by because it's a small aisle.

This place was pretty good and I guess worth the wait. Came on a Sunday morning, and waited about 45 mins (which I guess is not bad compared to what the other reviews have been saying).  The food came out pretty quickly which was great. I had the buttermilk pancakes (comes with 2), and they are HUGE that I couldn't even get to my second one. Pretty good though; they are super fluffy. The grits were really good, and they have the best homemade strawberry jam! yum!  The watermelon tea was alright.

I think we must have hit them up on an off day.  All my foodie friends love this place, though they swear by the fact that you should come by at least 30 mins before you actually want to eat, sign up and return 30 mins later.  This is true.  We were the 3rd table on the list and it took 45 minutes for them to seat us, and understandably, service was s-l-o-w------   We did the beignets sampler which was just okay.  A bit too tough, kinda needed to gnaw on it...  And while I appreciate creole/cajun food and love spice, the paprika and other spices on my omelette were overwhelming.  It wasn't quite spicy, but the overdone paprika left it tasting a bit too wood-y, or cardboard-y for me.   And between the two of us, we had two different coffee drinks, one drip coffee, and one an espresso-based coffee drink, both were terrible, AWFUL.  It's been a long time since I could say that I'd rather have 7-Eleven coffee or McDonalds coffee over what they served, really sour coffee.  Hands down the worst coffee in San Francisco. Service was not very friendly and seemed quite disorganized.  We didn't seem to have one designated server as our we were asked for our drink order by two different people, then oddly, no one checked back when we received our food.  And though we ordered the beignets and our entrees at the same time, it was 45 minutes between getting the beignets and then getting our entrees.  This was excruciating!   The kitchen staff looked burnt out and just plain unhappy.  Even getting our check took forever!  Absolutely not a good place for groups either!

Brenda's is the shit!  I started going there last year after reading about it in Todo.  I had been looking for Cajun food in the city and had came up empty.  Since last year I have been at least 8-10 times and I have never been let down.  The wait is forfucking ever, and the place is tiny, those are the only downsides.  The grillades and grits are dirty good, and the beignets are excellent too.  My favorite is definitely the crawfish one, its like god's vagina.  Anything you order should be excellent, definitely worth the wait, but I say come early or late.  I didn't mean for that to rhyme.

Delicious.  Pleased a meat-eater and vegetarian alike.  We tried the vegan sloppy josephine-- nicely spicy but not hot--and the gumbo, which was complex and satisfying.  We also split a house salad with buttermilk dressing-- very nice.  We took some apple beignets to go, because we were so full. There was a short wait for lunch on a Thursday-- well worth it.

We arrived at 10:30 on a Sunday (4 ppl) and were seated in an hour. Things you MUST order: crawfish beignets, grits, watermelon tea. Do NOT leave here without a glass of the watermelon tea. The one mediocre item I tried was the scrambled eggs. Nothing interesting at all. Skip the eggs. The specials board always has inventive dishes - today they were offering an oyster and bacon scramble. Also, the biscuits are pretty fantastic. Everything is pretty much drenched in butter, so vegans and nondairies beware. Service was very fast, friendly and with zero mistakes.

on a decent friday morning, i decided that i'm craving for some beignets...though, neither growing up eating them nor accessible for me to get one. crazy no? but let me tell you, i know what beignet is due to watching cooking shows or wasting my time skimming through cookbooks at the library. anyways, this place have the bomb-tastic beignets...in size, flavour, and colour. :D seriously, you gotta be here for breakfast for some beignets. i got the BEIGNET FLIGHT, which had a sample of each of their beignets: plain, apple, crawfish, chocolate. a perfect choice for people who want to try it all. PLUS, i got a side of their infamous grits...creamy, buttery, DIVINE! let me tell you, i loved them all, BUT i die over crawfish the most. i even paired it with the grits....which totally made sense! i'm a fan of their beignets, but i got to sit there and enjoy what makes Chef Brenda Buenviaje's joint that extra special and fabulicious. (oh yea! she's half- Filipino, which i'm very excited about!)

Unlike some other people, we didn't have to wait very long - maybe ten minutes for our table. Just make sure you go in and write your name on the board. The space is small and cramped, but it seems like they are  expanding next door (the sound of drilling and pounding is somewhat muted by the overall loudness of the restaurant itself.) The food is quite tasty and affordable...I'm from Tennessee...does that make me an expert? Probably not. The portions are huge! Come with an empty stomach, come early, and of course get the grits. Yummy.

Brenda's is an excellent experience that is consistent. I've been here several times after returning from Europe last year and each time the food is wonderful. Just about everything on the menu is appetizing so watch out if you have a hard time making up your mind. Also make sure to go during off hours our have a reservation because the wait can be immense.

So my amiga in culinary school asked if I wanted some French-styled breakfast and I thought, sure why not? I mean I eat just about everything...no need to even ask. As we approached our destination spot...lo and behold...it was Brenda's! One of my yelp bookmarks that I've been eager to try. My grin spread from ear to ear and I was giddy like a school kid:) It was around 1:30 when we arrived, and the wait was about 30 min. We opted for the counter which sped up the wait time just a bit, and were ready to chow down. It was so hard to choose what I wanted, but I decided to go with one of the specials since the regular menu would always be there. I ordered the cajun shrimp pot pie and my friend had the grillades and grits. My pot pie came with biscuit melted with cheddar cheese...Mmm...those biscuits were good and not oozing oil which was a definite plus. I sampled my friend's dish and it was fantastic. The creole gravy and oooh those grits were delish. I didn't realize how much I liked well-made grits until that moment. Of course we didn't dare leave without trying the beignets, and so the Ghiradelli chocolate it was! Ya....I'm gonna have to extend my workout regime just a tad...but it was sooo worth it.

My girlfriend has been wanting to go this place for a while, hearing whispers from the grapevines again and again.  Getting there around 10, the line was out the door, which was to be expected.  Luckily, there were only 3 parties before us.  However, going on a Saturday, you have to pay for street parking and it was 3.00 an hour.  We spent about $5 in quarters.  Seated, this place was very small yet very cozy.  You can swing your elbows and knock out the molars of the person next to you.  Because the tables are so close, you have to censor what you say because the parties next to you can hear.  So if you are going to say something explicit, shut it, and instead, grope under the table.   I had no idea how big the portions were going to be.  I ordered the special fried catfish eggs benedict along with a side of fries while my girlfriend got the watermelon tea, crayfish beignet and veggie omelet.  The beignet is like a french donut, stuffed in the inside and fried on the outside.  We were very surprised at its size.  We thought it was going to be a very small appetizer, however, it could literally serve as a meal.  To be honest, it was alrite.  It was very salty.  The french fries were delicious.  I could tell they were hand cut due to the remnants of potato skin; many places just fry frozen fries.  My catfish eggs Benedict was good but not amazing.  First off, the portions were huge.  The different thing is that instead of a muffin top, they use biscuits.  The downside is that it breaks easily and is very filling.  As a result, I labored to finish both eggs.  The catfish was very good.  The watermelon tea was good and the watermelon was authentic, not just a flavoring.  Her omelet was okay she said.  She regretted not asking them to scramble it as she has a peculiar quirk about not eating a layer of egg with stuffing inside.  We were both disappointed in the potatoes.  We thought it would be more fried and less filling, but we were served a heap of potato cubes.  There was no way we could finish it all.   The servers are very friendly and attentive.  They are always smiling so there is respect and love peppered with tepid disappointment.  I really wanted to like this place.  I believe you should come here at least once to experience it, but in my humble estimation, places with lines are not usually that great.  There is too much hype for the restaurant to live up too.  The meal was rather inexpensive considering the amount of food they give you.

Had the beignet flight! The southern flavored crawfish was deep in Cajun spices and had the hint of smokiness that I love in Lousiana flavors. The Ghirardelli chocolate beignet would turn me into an obese woman if they ever open up down here in Orange County. We also shared the grits which I've made myself at home and never liked, but Brenda, Oh Brenda, you've changed my mind. Thank you for makin' a bland ole grain into a soothing comfort dish that I now yearn for! MMmM MMmm good and most definitely worth the wait.

Great aunty Clara would be so pleased by the grits... they reminded me of the ones she makes when I visit her down in Alabama.  Delicious and cheesy.  My shrimp po boy was also really yummy.  The wait can be insanity, especially at brunch.... if you can go midweek for lunch to try Brenda's it might be a less painful option (at least wait-wise) and the menus for lunch and brunch are pretty similar.

To my dearest Brenda, Your soul food has brought me back to life with your amazing love in your food.  Thank you for your warm and inviting welcome as this was our first meet and greet over breakfast.  We were overwhelming impressed by all of the offerings you had us eat.  I instantly fell in love with your crawfish beignets, it had so much flavor in such a simple dish.  My tummy found comfort in your delicious gumbo and rice bowl.  Your grits and biscuits made my tongue dance with how good it tasted, that I forced myself to not feel guilty with the consumption of butter overload in the dish.  Your eggs benedict were uniquely deliciously created with fried catfish.  It certainly was not your typical eggs benedict, not just because of the fried catfish, it was replacing the english muffin for a biscuit.  You filled our tummies with your love in your food and left us eager for wanting more.  Thank you for your hospitality and will surely come by and visit the next time we are in the area. Warmest Regards, Crystal

I came here with two of my girlfriends one Sunday afternoon & waited for about an hour. But it was definitely worth the wait. All three of us never been here but always wanted to try it. We started with the beignet sampler--plain, chocolate, apple, & crawfish. I gotta say crawfish was really the best. Bottomless watermelon ice tea! I ordered the shrimp & grits, while my girls both got the any two eggs. The shrimp & grits were off the hook! Kinda wished that there were a bit more shrimp, but still good! They're now opened for dinner on Wednesdays through Saturdays. I can't wait to try what they have to offer for dinner.

.....let's just say I wanna grab 'em in the biscuits!! Upon the suggestion of my friend and certified foodie (but NOT.( I meant NOT...lol) in a pretentious foodie way) Mel V. , we checked out Brenda's. It was a Monday, so this 2 hour pre seating wait everyone kept talking about never happened to us, however, once we were seated and ordered our food, it took about 45 minutes. I'm not sayin' it wasn't worth it, but both myself and my two companions probably would have started eating our own arms if we didn't have our beverages and good converstaion to keep us distracted. I had their house watermelon sweet tea, which was perfection and just kept on flowing!! damn you watermelon sweet tea! I loved you, but you filled my belly. By the time my food came, I couldn't resist the deliciousness placed before me, and I practically needed to be wheeled out of the joint.  If you are looking for totally hearty eats at a decent price, this place is it!. My plate came with a HUGE omlett, a large bowl of gritts, and a monsterously mouthwatering biscuit (which was TO DIE FOR!) Aside from the yummy menu, the decor is classic and clean with lots of natural light, and the staff was friendly, attentive, and non-pretentious, which can be hit or miss with SF hotspots. A very satisifying first visit to Brenda's indeed!

Passed by here while walking through the neighborhood and after glancing at the menu, I was convinced I needed to check out the food.  Due to the fact that they're not open on Sundays, it was tricky to work into my schedule, but it was worth it. The place is VERY small (about 8 tables and a counter).  I got there around 11 and had to wait approximately 20 minutes for a table for 2.  As for the brunch, it was amazing.  Everything was under $10.00 and tasty.   Started with the chocolate beignets - there were three huge portions in the order.  I was pretty much done eating after one, but kept going.  My friend had the gumbo (nicely spiced and perfect on a rainy day) and I had the grillades -lovely stick to your ribs goodness.  Again, both servings were absolutely huge.   My friend couldn't resist the pumpkin pancakes with pecans, so we ended with those.  Again, huge and wonderful - I cannot imagine eating the whole thing alone though, you'd wind up in a diabetic coma.   As I was eating, I heard a number of people commenting that their food was "amazing" or the best thing they'd ever eaten.   I'll be back - lots of stuff on the menu that I still wanted to try and this is one of the few restaurants I've been too where I have not felt that everything on the menu was overpriced. The metered parking is pretty expensive (6 minutes per a quarter) and the meters only go one hour.  I saw the metermaid go by a few times, so be careful.

I've attempted to eat at Brenda's many times but gave up on that idea bc the wait is always long and slow--no matter the time, early at 8:30am or late at 1pm (even on a rainy day--you will see tons of umbrellas outside Brenda's). When I am hungry, I want to eat now, not in two hours. So we ordered for pick-up. Even ordering 30 minutes before pick-up, there is a wait! This is just insane! I guess they're busy for a reason. We ordered the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette, Gumbo, and the Beignet flight. Be aware, the drive home with the take-out is a difficult one. The beignet flight came with 4 different beignets: plain, Ghirardelli chocolate filled, Granny Smith Apple filled, and Crawfish filled. It was delicious but I felt that beignet dough was not as soft and chewy as I would have liked. The fillings were really good tho. The andouille and cheddar omelette was okay, nothing too special but the seasoned grits that came with was the best I've ever had. The gumbo was very flavorful and seasoned well but then again--it tasted like the Safeway deli gumbo. Then another time, we had lunch ordered at the office- I ordered the oyster poboy sandwich.  I'm not the biggest fan of cooked oysters but have had fried oysters a few times and loved it so I gave it a shot.  Bad idea! The combination of the chipotle remoulade sauce and fried oyster made me sick all day. I felt the sauce was too greasy and overpowering.  It was hard enough that the juice from the fried oyster was dripping as I ate at my desk--but to also have this greasy chipotle remoulade sauce running everywhere--it was really hard to enjoy. Not something I would recommend eating at your desk unless you want to use a whole roll of disinfecting wipes to clean your desk after. And the smell of the sauce and fried oyster was all bad for my hands even after washing it so many times. My face felt dirty after. I'm all about getting down and dirty for great food--but this sandwich was not worth it at all. I had to stop after a few bites and settled with the skinny fries. just a little overrated.

brenda's bengie's were magnificent. they're essentially french donuts. the grillade was an excellent blend of taste - juicey and tender beef, yum! (all the calories...that's a different story) the teas were only decent, but pretty authentic with the cuisine. i think breakfast/brunch is the best time to pay them a visit, however anytime after 11 means it gets crowded both inside the restaurant and in the crowds of hungry patrons outside, awaiting their seats.   service was average; nothing out of the norm or anything lacking in particular. i would suggest small groups of 4 or less as this place is seriously tiny.

I love breakfast and brunch. So I was determined to try Brenda's, especially since everyone Yelp had given it such great reviews. So finally I went there, unfortunately, like everyone else, I had to wait in line, for about 15 minutes, to get a table. Brenda's is a very small place, so I would not recommend this for groups more than 5, especially if they don't have the patience to wait outside in the Tenderloin. The food was yummy. It kept true to it's southern home style cooking, I tried their special- pecan french toast. It was good but not great. The bacon was mediocre. But do not fret, the beignets filled with ghirardelli chocolate is amazing. I think this a good place for breakfast/brunch connoisseurs alike and I believe Brenda's has the potential to be a great place (hint: expanding the place).

MMMMMMmmmm Breakfast Gulf Coast style with a touch of California.  The grillades were the bomb and the savory beignets were delicious.... I miss the Gulf Coast!!!! Oh well, at least I live in a a city multicultural enough and food savvy enough to have it all... muahahaha.  WORD!  only downside is the wait, so don't go expecting to make your doctor's appointment an hour after arriving.  Relax, enjoy the wait with some friends and know that the goodness will find its way to your tummy eventually.

i love me some soul food. batter it, deep fry it, slap it on a plate and i will consume it. i have a crush on New Orleans. as a city, i love the attitude, the pace, the scene, and of course, the food. Brenda's embodies everything i hold dearly about NOLA. we came mid-week for lunch. we started with the beignets, which were simply divine. my favorite was the classic unfilled, but the chocolate was also tasty. the only awkward moment was the crawfish beignet. it just didn't fit in with the sweetness of the others (classic, choc, and apple cinnamon). it should have been a separate order... but still nommy once you get past the combo weirdness. the star of the afternoon was the shrimp and grits. there are really no words to describe just how amazing they were. the shrimp were perfectly cooked, the grits were cheesy and cooked to tender yumminess. also delish was the andouille sausage omelet. salty, cheesy (i see a theme), fluffy, and all things good about eggs. service was efficient, as it was crazy busy for the lunch rush, but friendly. they also do take-out if you can't handle the wait. but it's never as good to go as it is on the spot. go here. now.

i completely disagree w/ all the rave reviews about this place (even the breakfast) and i am so disappointed that it was not as good as i thought it would be.  in fact i would not recommend it nor would i even give it a second chance. the beignets (plain) were terrible - they were tasteless and dense and even eating w/ all the icing sugar did not add anything to it. breakfast was okay - nothing to write home about. the cafe au lait was actually disgusting. i thought this place would be as yummy as cafe du monde (coffee and beignets) in new orleans - but it was not comparable.

unpretentious and easygoing, brenda's makes a great addition to the otherwise gloomy/smelly neighborhood.  it is also a prime spot where one can eat alone without feeling self-conscious, which is perfect for those days when you just don't feel like conversing with someone while trying to stuff your face with fried goods (read: PMSing). i had the oyster poboy, which came with a generous helping of perfectly breaded and crispy oysters that were still tender and flavorful on the inside.  and man, that smoky chipotle sauce was amazing.  the sweet watermelon iced tea was refreshing but had a tad too much basil(?) in there for my taste.  fries were a little boring as fries tend to be, so perhaps i will give the coleslaw a go next time.   i will be back to try the beignets on a day where i haven't already eaten my weight in fried foods (hey, it could happen).

At first I wasn't excited about Brenda's, kinda a sketchy neighborhood, but duh, I should know better.  The food was all great.  Brenda in fact was cooking it up in the kitchen!  It had a cozy feel, only 40 ppl can be seated at a time, while those waiting outside stare at you trying not to let the drool get on the window pane.  A fishbowl feeling but I would go back again! I had the yummy gumbo and turkey sloppy joe (Josephina-i think).  We were a big group, 6, so we covered the menu and everyone loved their share.

Yummy in the tummy!  Cute staff, good service, fantastic grits.  I loved my oyster and bacon fry and think the crawfish beignets are HEAVEN on earth.  It's tiny, and you have to wait, but that's part of the charm.  Even the coffee was super tasty.  My only bummer was the apple beignet.  It had too much nutmeg for my tastes.  I look forward to introducing many more friends to this wonderful location.

I've been wanting to write this review for over a year, and now all I can remember to say is that I remember just loving this place. Totally small, ridiculously long lines.  And I love the flight of beignets, especially the crawfish ones.  The fact that Brenda is a mix of creole and Filipino is pretty cool; feel like she's putting us Filipino's on the map which is always something to be proud of!  I'd definitely come back, though on a non-rainy day next time!

Brenda, listen. The whole 'engagement' thing between my fianceé and me? It's nothing... honestly. If I could be with you and your french toast & butter pecan sauce, you'd make me the luckiest man alive. Say you will.

We went to Breanda's for dinner on 7/7/2012.  First of all the waitress we had was rude.  The other waitress was very nice. The food was interesting the yams and bread pudding were excellent. We had the red beans entree not to much taste, the shrimp sandiwch was pretty good and the ribs were a little burned.

Oyster po boy was good but drowned in a sauce that degraded the quality of the fried oysters. Crawfish beignets also seemed good but were smacked over the top with a heavy "all around" spice. Kind of made my mouth go ?? I've had tons of po boys and beignets in the past and service and people seemed nice but I wouldn't rush back for the food. I should have gone with a simple red beans and rice, guy next to me was munching that down.

After walking around San Francisco, I ended up at Little Saigon around 3 o' clock. Yelp brought me to Brenda's. It is a pretty small place but in a good way. Since I came in after 3 o' clock, I ended up ordering from the snack menu. I had a small bowl of gumbo and watermelon iced tea. Surprisingly, these two were a perfect combination. The gumbo had the right amount of heat that was complemented by the refreshing taste of the watermelon iced tea. Both for around $6.50.

I really love beignets so when I heard Brenda's French Soul Food had them I made a bee-line.  We went mid week around 10am and mosied right on in, no wait...sounds like we were lucky.  Of course, in ordinary time people would be WORKING!  ahem.  Anyways, I'm thrilled to report I loved it.  I had the beignets (plain), also had the shrimp pot pie, and dh had some kind of oyster scramble.  It was all really really good.  I would definately come back here again and make sure it's off hours.

Never ever ever wanna leave this place. From the 5 minute wait, to the super friendly staff, to the big bowl of coffee with chicory (yum!) and the fantastic food, I am smitten with this joint. Maybe it was the best, coziest corner table that we got, or maybe it was just a particularly lovely lazy sunday, but I would gladly make the trek out from the sunset to visit Brenda again. B said it was the best french toast in town and I would tend to agree since I don't even like french toast that much but I had to steal a few more bites even though I had just eaten an entire bacon and egg tartine (tomato bacon relish? genuis!).

Brenda, a HUGE THANK YOU!!   Having grown up with a Cajun mom and having spent my summers as a kid with my grandma Mere' in southern Louisiana, south of Lafayette, and my cousins in New Orleans; I've had a lot of great Cajun food.  I have been trying to find an authentic Cajun/Creole place in the bay area and you made my New Years!  I had a shrimp po-boy, (thanks for using the corn meal batter!), slaw and black-eyed peas and it was the real deal.  (You have to have the black eyed peas and cabbage for New Years)  I can't wait to go back and try the rest! Cheers, Katherine

The food here was delicious. I had the shrimp and goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions, a biscuit and grits on the side, and of course, beignets (which come three to an order) to start. After swallowing each bite, I kept turning to my friend asking him if this was or was not the best thing he had ever tasted. He wasn't quite as overjoyed as I was by his selection, but we both agreed that the food was fantastic. It's a rich food experience, so I'll probably only go back on special occasions. Go early! Or just bring a paper and relax, it's worth the wait.

I LOVE this place! It's one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  I have converted many of my friends.  You must try the flight of beignets, watermelon tea, biscuits and gumbo.  My favorite dish is the special molasses pork chop that comes around only once in a while.  The only con about Brenda's is the wait, which is usually 45 minutes to an hour.  Hopefully it will be better once they expand.  It's delicious food at a very decent price.

I am giving this place 3 stars because the service was excellent!  The waiter noticed that I was not comfortable sitting at the table right next to the door, it was a cold and rainy night.  He offered a us a different table as soon as one opened up in a better location which made the restaurant experience a little better.  The food was a bit disappointing because the chicken gumbo had one piece of chicken in each of our bowls and the rice was hard and not cooked all the way.  The ribs tasted old and dry, but was drenched in bbq sauce.  The mac n cheese was good though.  The fried chicken was nothing spectacular and was kinda dry too. I am willing to give Brenda's a second chance because it may have been an off night in the kitchen.  Hoping that their brunch will be a much better food experience!

Again, Yelp has led me to a great place I would've never found on my own. Walked in and smiled to myself when I saw that this place had a New Orleans style to it. I had one of the specials which was pork belly on cheddar grits with a scallion (and something else) relish with poached eggs ($12.75). I asked for the eggs to be scrambled instead of poached and this wasn't a problem. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The grits were really deliciously cheesy, though a little hard to eat with all the melted strings. The eggs were AMAZING!! I love French style eggs; nice and soft, almost undercooked and these were perfect. The pork belly was good, also, but the rub was a little too strong for me and I didn't think it went all that well with everything else. Whatever the heck that scallion relish I have no idea what red stuff is was SO good. It was a little too hot for me when I mixed it with the grits, but it was great when I dipped the eggs in them. I also had the watermelon sweet tea just to try it and I didn't really like it that much, it was just one of those weird things I thought I should do. I'm only in town for 4 days, but I'm DEFINITELY going back here for breakfast 2 more times. Also, I was eating alone and got there around 9am and there was no wait.

I don't know if its exactly french or exactly soul food.  But I do know that its delicious.  Of course the wait was a bit horrendous, but its worth it.  Seems that its easier if you come in three's or single's.  The place is freakin' tiny, but the food filled my belly with goodness.  I had the shrimp po' boy sandwhich, which they made by request and wasn't even on the menu that day.  It was more fresh tasting than anything.  REAL ones are a bit more soggy, but this was good and tasty.  The watermelon iced tea had a really unique taste, I DID have seconds.  I'm coming back to eat grits,

everything is good. the end. seriously though, overall great food and i felt like it was a good value too. here's a play by play of the things i've tried: beignet sampler - loved the crawfish and granny smith apple, liked the chocolate, thought the plain was okay (caveat: i really prefer my foods either sweet or salty) gumbo - so good. honestly i haven't had a lot of gumbo, but this was great. liked the sausage pieces in particular. gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelette - pretty good, high quality shrimp. as far as omelettes go, it wasn't spectacular but it was good. sides: biscuits - so good i boxed it to eat for later that day. and even better with their homemade jam. potato hash - i could've eaten just this for brunch and have been happy. they take off the potato skin here, so it's just the inside, and it's perfectly cooked to be the right texture of soft/mushy. then they spice it with onions, bell peppers, semi-spicy sauce... probably the best brunch potato hash i've ever had, and i've had a lot of potato hash for brunch.

Brenda's probably doesn't really need my endorsement seeing as everyone knows about the place but I feel I must reiterate how delicious the crawfish beignets are. So delicious in fact that I would not hesitate giving my firstborn child away for a plate of them. Yes people. That good.

So we went here due to the rave reviews, and because I missed Nawlins food. There was a 15 minute wait around noon. Tried the beignet variety plate; I was upset that only the crawfish one was tasty (beignets should be light and soft, not heavy and crunchy), this plate is a bit much even to share between 2 people; if you're a small party, I suggest you only order your beignets individually. Tried the gumbo, it tastes good, but is really salty. Have to say the special, crawfish po'boy was our fave. The watermelon iced tea was OK.

There is not much worth my precious time that I will wait for.  Especially for breakfast. But this place was worth the wait. Came here on a rainy Saturday around 1130 and had to wait a little over an hour to be seated. We were seated at the window table which we thought would be a stellar table.....wrong. It was the coldest spot in the restaurant thanks to the door that was constantly opening that no one (except for my dining partner) would close. The server was nice enough to apologize for that though. The chocolate beingets were pretty good just a little too chocolaty and sweet for me, which is surprising. I am a chocolate-aholic. The granola pancakes were a little much for me after the beingets but they were tasty. I especially loved the fruit on top with the vanilla sauce. The jam they serve is to die for especially the strawberry. Some would recommend spreading it on their de-lish flaky biscuits but I ate if straight, YUM! Be prepared to be in a carb coma after breakfast here.

Absolutely one of the top three best breakfast spots in San Francisco.  Maybe not the best location and the staff do see a bit jaded, but you'll forget that the split second the food hits your mouth.  I had the Creole Veggie Omelette, which was perfectly prepared.  Amazing biscuits and creamy grits to round out a near perfect breakfast.

I guess we were lucky because midday on a Sunday we were able to get in with only about 20 minutes wait (compared to the usual 1 hour). I was told it's because word hasn't fully gotten out that they're open on Sundays now. The bf appreciated being able to get coffee while we waited. I didn't like standing so much, I wish they had little benches or chairs for people to sit on while waiting. I wouldn't have minded standing so much if it hadn't been so windy outside. However once inside and safe from the cold wind, our server was excellent as was the busser, who was all over clearing our table, refilling our water glasses and the bf's coffee mug and seeing if we needed anything else like more napkins and utensils.  The bf appreciated the slightly bitter chicory taste the coffee had.  To start with we ordered the dark chocolate filled beignets. Not my favorite. The bf loved them because they were crispy on the outside. I prefer them a a little less crispy/browned and I found that they had just a little too much chocolate. But, I appreciate that they offer plain ones in addition to assorted filled, sweet and savory options! I would love to try the Crawfish & cheddar ones soon. I ordered  the Corned Beef potato hash (Chalkboard Special) that came with two scrambled eggs and a big warm biscuit. It was excellent, all of it. The eggs, the buttery yet perfectly crumbly biscuit, the hash with melted cheese and veggies and copious amounts of Corned Beef. The bf ordered the Grillades and Grits. We ended up trading because the Grillades were exactly like my mom's chile con carne that I just had to eat them all. The  beef cutlets were tender, the   sauce was smoky, slightly spicy, and creamy all at once. The grits were rich, and gooey with that indescribable texture that only grits and maybe polenta have that I LOVE.  The peach cobbler pancakes are what I have in mind for next time I go!

I can't begin to tell you how much I love Cajun/Creole food; especially shrimp & oyster po'boys. i am getting hungry, just writing this review. Brenda's has got it all, including the best gumbo I've tasted in my life. I also waited a while to write this review, since the word is already out on Brenda's. Hence, you will find a line and long wait when visiting on a weekend for brunch ... but, it is worth it. I'd recommend the beignet flight, po'boy (of course), gumbo,a nd getting there early. But, even if you have to wait 1 - 2 hours, you will not be dissapointed.

plain beignet - awesome in its simplicity.  not super sweet.  crispy on the outside and perfectly doughy on the inside. sweet potato pancakes - butter pecan syrup!   but the best dish may have been the shrimp grits!  cheese, bacon, tomato, garlic...yum. worth the hour wait for 3...but will go again with just 2 to avoid ever having to wait that long again.

Another fabulous meal at Brenda's! Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  We arrived around 12:45pm and waited about 30 mins before we got seated at the counter.  Half an hour wait wasn't too bad compared to the weekend wait, and by 1:30 there didn't seem to be much of a wait at all.  Like others have mentioned, I'd recommend going later in the day. Something new - we ordered the corned beef hash special.  It was good, but my bacon and egg tartine still blows me away.  It's all about the sauce!  :) I brought a biscuit home and warmed it up in the toaster over the next morning.  OMG...happy all over again.

If I was basing this review on the food, I would give it 4 stars. However, what happened to us today was incredibly lame. After my husband and my usual Sunday morning debate about where to go for brunch, I suggested that we go to Brenda's. We had been once before, and the food was fairly good. Also, it was 2pm, and Brenda's is open until 3pm, which worked out perfectly. We hopped in the car, found parking fairly easily and walked up to the restaurant at 2:40pm. When we arrived, there was a sign-in sheet near the door with the word CLOSED written in bold letters at the bottom. We checked with the other people waiting in line, and sure enough, they had closed the sign-in. Now, I would understand if it was 3:00, but it was 20 minutes to, which is just lame. Frustrated and annoyed, my husband and I got in the car and tried to figure out where to go now that our brunch plans were kaput. He decided he wanted to call them to express his frustration, and, after getting an answering machine message on which you couldn't even leave a message, my husband finally got through to someone. After explaining our frustration, rather than apologizing or explaining nicely, the woman he spoke to was extremely rude and said that they normally close it at 2:30 (insinuating that we were lucky it was closed so late this time). Having worked in restaurants before, I understand wanting to create a situation where the employees can go home at a decent hour, but if that is the case, then say the restaurant closes at 2:30 and leave it at that. Needless to say, we will not be returning to Brenda's.

Seriously, Brenda, you've got something awesome going on here. The shrimp & grits was comparable to dying and going to heaven, and that shrimp poboy was second to none. To top it all off, as if the watermelon iced tea wasn't fantastic enough, it comes with FREE REFILLS. Brenda, you rock - don't ever change.

Well the ideas on their menu sound creative but the actual dish, not so delicious.  Tried the BBQ pulled pork sweet potato hash.  I found barely a few strands of pulled pork and the sweet potatoes were not crispy like a hash should be, but more like mush.  Eggs were overcooked as well, yolks were cooked solid.  Son and friend had their eggs benedict and the hollandaise was different.

I orded the Sweet Potato pancakes which were to "dye" with the beignets and the Egg and Bacon Tartine.  I had to take my food togo and eat in the car because the wait was an hour plus long but it was something that Ive never had before and I will definitely go back again. I would recommend going to the restaurant, writing your name down on the board, leave and go do something and come back an hour later because the wait is serious but worth it.!

This tiny Tenderloin jem will have you salivating for pumpkin pancakes covered in butter pecan sauce or chorizo cheddar omletes with a biscuit, grits or potato hash. When friends visit me in SF this is the first place I take them.  It's so good that even writing this review makes me  crave Brenda's nourishment! Share the beignet flight with your companion, get your own dish and try the sweet watermelon tea. Prices are reasonable for the quality and portion of what you get (around $10 a plate).    Beware: they don't take reservations, you have to put your name on a wait list outside and it may take a while. Opt to take a spot at the counter tops if you don't need a table.

the specials are kind of hard to see inside the place because they're written on the mirror with white marker but don't forget to check them out. get the eggs benedict with fried catfish and the grits. trust me on this one. also, the flight of beignets looked absolutely amazing. we didn't get them in fear of over ordering but i regret it. they looked like they would've been worth the disgustingly full feeling and stomach ache at 8am. definitely a must try for my next visit.

The hype is true my friends - I was looking to try a new brunch spot.  I did some research and my bf and I headed over to Brendas.  We got there around 11, and put our names on the list, and waited... and waited... for about 45 minutes we almost got discouraged - but we held out, and I am so glad we did!  We got the Beignets sample platter.  Delish.  I think the plain are actually my favorite.  The savory Crawfish one was awesome, and the chocolate and apple are also very tasty.  I opted for the watermelon tea and the catfish benedicts.  My bf got the coffee and chicory, and the bacon and egg tartine.  We both opted for the potato hash instead of grits.  I really shouldn't have plowed through the benedicts, but there was no way I could leave any left over.  My boyfriend did the same.  The potatoes had to suffer from not getting proper attention, but those carbs would not fit in our bellies following all the other deliciousness.   Definitely check it out - expect to wait. The place is VERY tiny and to get to the bathrooms you have to basically walk through the kitchen, but oh well. They have crammed as many tables into the place as humanly possible... so expect to hear all of your neighbors conversations.  Come here with a party of 4 maximum.

My rating is torn, the food is awesome!  Love the sandwiches, fried chicken, beignets, there isn't anything I've tried that I didn't love.  I usually have to bring a bunch of friends so we can share a bunch of dishes kinda family style.  However with my recent visit I didn't even stay for a meal due to the cute yet horribly controlled chalk board sign in system!  There are 3 large chalk boards that you write your name on as they seat guest, names are erased, however new people are inserting they're names in these spots and if you're lower on the list you're SCREWED!  We brought this to the attention of the host after patiently waiting our turn for 40 minutes, he didn't care or give any compassion, he simply said that there wasn't anything he could do and just following the list.  That is just ridiculous!  No compassion?  I wasn't wanting to be seated next as there were others getting SCREWED!  But seriously?!?  Unfortunately due to this I won't be coming back unless they fix the signing in system but even at that I would be skeptical.  You need to work on your customer service skills!!  Good luck to you if you try this place!

The beignets were just alright, but I'm still giving this place 4 stars because the overall food quality there is very good.  The Grillade and Grits I had was very good, a spicy savory sauce over the beef cutlet and the grits were a perfect compliment as were the perfectly cooked eggs.  The watermelon tea is something special.  The bananas foster french toast was outstanding.  Overall a very good place for breakfast/brunch.  I suggest going there early or you'll have to wait at least 45 minutes.

OK, I am from the south so I am often disappointed by restaurants that claim to be southern cooking.  BUT NOT HERE.  Everything was perfect.  I had the special Bananas Foster French toast (and I savored every bite -- even though I couldnt finish the huge plate).  I sampled the Hang Town Fry that my friend had and I loved it too.  Next time I will get that.  Grits were perfect, too (just the way I like them, how did they know?!?) Beignets came out fast and were perfect with the coffee. Make sure you split an order if you are going to eat a full breakfast too. we went at 8:35 on a Sunday to beat the rush and still had to wait a little on the sidewalk.  Just read the paper and talked with the other folks on the sidewalk.  If they weren't so busy htey could probably take a hint from Mama's Royal in Oakland and let folks get their coffee and drink it ooutside while they wai (ohh, even the coffee was good!) all-in-all I didn't eat again until 5PM - even though I did a 3 hour walk with my dog around noon! I'll be back!

I waited 40 minutes on a Friday afternoon and it was well worth the wait. Braised Rib - Melted in your mouth. Cheddar Grits - Tastes exactly how they make it in the South. So buttery & yummy. Chocolate Beignets - The melted dark chocolate inside the beignet is super hot so be careful. So good & gooey that I want more. Next time I'll have to try the sampler. Very affordable and I love the homey feel to it.

I walk by this place every single day on the way to work and I always fantasize about ditching work and eating myself into a coma and falling back asleep.   Sadly I have never been able to talk myself into that indulgent fantasy.  However, with Brenda's open for dinner, I was able to finally try the Sexy Southern Sweetness.  It was a rainy 420 and I was really hungry, if you catch my drift... Anyways, no wait, kind server, cute but tiny inside.  The menu was a beautiful work of art and my brother and I stared at it forever, trying to decide which treat would be the best for that moment.  I settled on the Oyster Po'boy. ahhhhh. So good.  First Oyster Po'boy I have ever had, but just amazing, rich, flavorful, the bread it was on was perfectly butterey and toasted.  Everything about the Po'boy was excellence.  Cole slaw was dope too.   I was shocked when I saw the bill, shocked in the good way.  This place is so affordable! Great value.  I can not wait to go back and try the catfish and shrimp po'boys!!!

Ok, I plan to give this place another try on some other day except for Saturday brunch. This place was on fire, and the chefs were working real hard to keep up with the flames...unfortunately it was reflected in my order.   Let's start with...the food was tasty yes, but the venue was crowded, crowded, crowded...AND not in a good way...You literally have no room to breathe...way too small for such a popular spot...waaay TOO small!   I'll give it this.  The place is warm and toasty with all that body heat in such a confined space.  Warm and toasty is right up our alley in this frigid weather, but what happens come late-spring/early-summer?  Trust me on this...order your food to go.   I tried the croque monsieur. You usually can't go wrong with the staples.  The menu choices are filled with popular favorites.  The ham was smokey...very good.  Someone got happy with the bechamel sauce.  I could have done without the extra.  The gumbo was OK the day of...AND extremely flavorful the next day...real big difference which is not unusual.   The beignets with the exception of the plain were a big hit with me.  The molten Ghirardelli chocolate beignets were excellent...rich, rich...Rich...very nice combination. I ordered the apple beignets, but they gave me the crawfish instead.  They thought they gave me apple and dusted them generously with powder sugar.  I can see how this mistake was made since all of the beignets with the exception of the plain look the same. I had that sweet and savory thing going on...and I have to say it wasn't toooo bad.  I would have liked to have had it dusted with paprika as it should have been or the apple beignets that I ordered.   When I inquired whether the crawfish should be dusted with powder sugar, I was told that I did not have the crawfish version...I was told that I had the apple that I ordered.  I was really nice when I made this inquiry...I mean reeaalllly nice, and I was a little shocked when she did not offer to correct the matter...I have to say I was a little turned off.  She's definitely not the ideal "front of the house" representation...not too friendly under pressure although I can tell that she is a real take charge hardworking individual which I admire in most people. If I had not personally witnessed them all including Brenda trying to drink water from a fire hose...keeping up with the demands of their popularity, I would have asked for a different outcome.   I decided to be lenient, and I feel good about it.  As I mention, I plan to give the experience another try.  I'm hoping for a better outcome.  Oh, leaving on a positive note, I like the website...Well done!  Who wouldn't want to check this place out after visiting the site?

I adore Brenda's in spite of its tiny size which makes me wonder how it crosses peoples' minds to bring large groups to this place. Every time we go there are at least two groups of 6. Of course, this is not the restaurant's fault. And I wouldn't expect them to turn anyone away. But when I'm with a big group I tend to think of the right place to accommodate everyone comfortably and Brenda's does not strike me as that place. Anyway, enough ranting. The food here is divine. They do eggs just right, especially egg whites which always turn out fluffy and perfect, never too dry. Really, the best thing about Brenda's is the Community coffee with chicory. It's like manna. And don't forget the grits, the delicious grits. Their tomato relish is to die for. I've had it on several different dishes, like the shrimp & goat cheese omelette and their shrimp and grits special. Oh, and definitely get the biscuit on the side. There is always a wait but it's never as long as you think it will be. Honestly, it wouldn't be nearly as bad if those massive friend packs found a more suitable venue :)

Worth the wait, which ended up being an hour on a Saturday morning.   Try the crawfish beignets if you know what's good for you.  Get the buttery Gritz and the big biscuit (so you can use their homemade peach jam on it!) for the side dishes.  Also, when your waiting in line, go to Philz coffee on Van Ness.  Best coffee in San Francisco.

long story short: i love brenda's french soul food. true, the wait can be long. but hey, my friend and i just kinda rolled out of bed on a sunday. any place worth going for brunch takes awhile. brenda's is great because: 1) beignets! so tasty. certainly not the best, but damn - they have crawfish ones! those were quite delicious. 2) watermelon sweet tea. so cool and refreshing with chunks of watermelon in it. AND they kept refilling our glasses. AND they let me take a cup to go. 3) fried catfish eggs benedict. my go-to for brunch has always been eggs benedict and this didnt disappoint - the catfish was done perfectly. the biscuit, however, was a bit too thick for me, but that's all i could really complain about. 4) bonus bonus bonus - they let me get a half order of their cream cheese stuffed french toast! they were so accomodating it was great. if i still lived in the bay, i would definitely go back to this spot. or at least order some crawfish beignets to go.

I came here on a rainy Saturday morning for brunch with my friend. Waited for over an hour... definitely worth the wait! We ordered Croque-monsieur, shrimp and grits, and peach cobbler pancakes (which was one of the weekend specials). Wow, everything was sooooo good. The shrimp and grits were especially wonderful... great texture and flavor. Mmm, I can't wait to go back and try something else. I want to eat everything on the menu!

out of all the many southern soul food spots popping up in SF, this is by far the best (and yes, i've been to boxing room) first time i came i had the grillades and grits. everything had a good flavor and was well seasoned.  my friend and i also split the beignet flight- it was really good. they had the right consistency of a beignet from cafe du monde- light and fluffy and not over fried (some places overfry and the dough ends up just soaking up the oil and it gets really gross). second time i had the hushpuppies: nice and crispy on the outside with a fluffy perfectly balanced savory/sweetness of corn on the inside. the sauce it comes with is delightfully spicy and compliments it well.   then i had the red beans and rice with sausage. i felt like i was back at Mother's Restaurant fight back in New Orleans. Smokey, spicey, heart well cooked beans (not over done and mushy) the andouille had a great kick to it (a well selected sausage) and the rice was tender and fluffy. i can't wait to go back and try something else!

Not a fan of the 2 hr wait, but had to say that I can see why people love this place. A group of 5 shared the grillades, veggie omelette, tartine, eggs benedict and the beignet sampler. The two outstanding items were definiately the crawfish beignets and the fried green tomato and bacon eggs benedict. I would literally bathe in that delicious hollendaise sauce and if they poured it over a shoe I might be tempted to eat it. Being from the south I thought the grits were rich and creamy, but not the best I have ever had. Its my only mild gripe. The quality of the food was top notch, but its questionable as to wheter or not I will brave the wait again...I might be easily convinced to do so. Service should be highly lauded. Once seated they are super attentive and were impeccable.   Highly recommended for those who enjoy good soul food and possess a fair amount of patience. I'd say kill time over at Philz coffee and grab an Instanbul Treat. I had a sip of my friend's tea and thought it was way more delicious than my really tasty decaf coffee!

i don't get it. waited 45 mins for a table of 2 at 10 in the morning on a saturday. we ordered the crawfish beignet and fried oyster and bacon omelette. not really worth the wait and definitely was not blown away. the crawfish beignet sounded like a good idea, but it didn't taste all that great...kinda sweet dough with savory insides. there was barely enough cheese or crawfish to really match up to the thick, heavy fried dough surrounding it. the paprika outside was also overwhelming. the oyster omelette, though better than the beignet, was also a dissapointment. greasy, chucks of bacon fat and insufficient amount of oysters. service was slow. had to ask for water 3 times and the coffee sucked! how can a brunch place have bad coffee?! they also don't offer reduce fat/ non-fat milk (the host actually looked at me like i was asking for a four leaf clover or something)! don't even bother asking for artificial sweetner...all in all, failed brunch experience...

Yumm - so good!  Had the crawfish beignets and the shrimp and goat cheese omelet.  Everything was wonderful. My friends had a pulled pork sandwich and the fried oyster omelet and they enjoyed their dishes as well.  We waited a bit on  a Tuesday for lunch and considering how small the place is, I assume you'd wait a bit on a weekend.  I think it's well worth it.

I am from Mississippi and my family and i would drive down to New Orleans every other weekend to pick up some beignets. And let me tell you the ones at brenda's are pretty similar. I really love the crawfish beignets and i always, always order a cup of gumbo before my meal. Her daily specials change frequently which includes an awesome red beans and rice. I really like this place and dont mind waiting 30 mins for a table.

This place is worth every minute spent waiting for a table.  Being the only breakfast restaurant offered up by a friend for my visit to SF that I hadn't tried -- I was curious to see if the Cajun-French Soul Food lived up to the reviews here on Yelp.   We started with the traditional begniets, which were a pretty-good facimile of what you'd find in New Orleans.  (I've never found an equal out of N.O., but these were close.)  I had the shrimp-cream-cheese omellete with onions, which -- despite there being far more onions than a person should resonably consume at one sitting -- was quite delicious.  The shrimp looked as if they had been prepped with a bay-type seasoning before going into the omellete, which added to the flavor.  The sweet tomatoe topping was an interesting flavor, however I think it clashed a bit with the shrimp.  The homemade bisquit made me literally homesick.  It was so fluffly and lovely -- made even better by the peach preserves. The cheese grits, though.  To-die-for.  Don't leave here without them.  Skip the chicory coffee.

I have been to Brenda's twice now and will definitely be going back again (this week actually to take relatives who are in from out of town).  The food is very good and the wait staff friendly (albeit a little busy as they run around trying to turn the tables).  We have had the flight of beignets, all of which were great, the Croque Monsieur and the gumbo.  My one negative comments comes from the gumbo.  The first time we came, the gumbo had a very strong smokey taste -- almost burned.  I have had better at other places in town and was pretty sure I would not order it again.  However, last weekend, I decided to try it again on our second visit.  It was worth the second chance.  The flavor was much better.  My guess is that they slightly burned the roux the first time and got it right the second. A word has to be said about the wait -- There will be one.  We waited 45 minutes the first time and an hour the second.  That is fine if  you know about it in advance and can plan.  Brenda's is different, however, from other restaurants with regard to its procedures for handling its line.  You put your name on the board and must be there when your name is called.  Both times we have gone, people came back after their names had been called and were disappointed that they were not just the next person seated.  If they wanted to get a table, their name went to the bottom of the list.

They have the most amazing biscuits EVER!  The home-made jam they serve in little pots on every table is wonderful on top.  I am telling you that these biscuits are something that you will crave every couple of weeks once you try them.  The beignets are good as well and by the time I eat those I am too full for much else.  For sure worth trying Brenda's if you don't want to wait in an outrageous line for Dottie's.

I lived in New Orleans for 10 years and I'm a self-proclaimed foodie! It's really difficult to find authentic flavors anywhere in the Bay Area, but Brenda's masterfully and meticulously honors the flavors, textures and "feel" of New Orleans food. It's a small cramped space, bit the food outweighs any negatives in atmosphere. The gumbo is fantastic! The watermelon house tea is worth a visit in itself. The fried shrimp po' boy transports you to the sweltering, sultry, lazy, any-excuse-for-a-party attitude and celebration of life and food that New Orleans is famous for.

I've been going to school a couple blocks from here for about 2 years now and I just got around to trying this place. I've always wanted to but never had the time, and trying to get in on the weekends is a joke. I hate waiting. So I finally went this morning and I was not disappointed. I ordered the Grillades & Grits. It is, "beef cutlets braised in spicy creole gravy, served with grits & two eggs any style, plus cream biscuit or toast." Definitely went with the biscuit and it was probably the best biscuit I have ever had. Warning, this place likes to cook their eggs a little more than other places, so ordering over-medium gets you cooked yoke. I had to have my eggs redone. Other than that, the food was great. I will definitely be back, but I'll have to wait until I burn off this 3000 calorie breakfast.

3.75 Stars I have to say, Yelp let me down a bit on this one. With all the hype surrounding the beignets, especially the crawfish beignet, I was really expecting more. The beignets were okay, but nothing to rave about. And the crawfish one needed way more cheese to combat the dryness. My mother had the Beignet Flight which has one each of plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish. I stole a bite of each. She and I agreed that the beignets themselves weren't bad, but they weren't great either. Pretty much a let down. My sister and her friend split the Creole Veggie Omelette & the French Toast with Butter Pecan Sauce. The both agreed their food was tasty and enjoyable but nothing spectacular. However, the cream biscuit that came with the Creole Veggie Omelette was perfect! Fluffy, flakey, buttery, and melt in your mouth delicious! I would have stolen the whole thing from them had I not been distracted by what was definitely the highlight of what we ordered - my meal, the Shrimp & Grits. The Shrimp & Grits was absolutely amazing and did not disappoint. This is what earns Brenda's the fourth star. The grits are deliciously cheesy and creamy, while the spicy tomato-bacon gravy adds a nice balance. I think it needed more kick, so I added a ton of tabasco. But the flavor itself was nice so long as I didn't think of it as spicy. Oh and the shrimp were plump and juicy! The whole combination was absolutely delicious. BUT I do not recommend trying to eat this on your own. I'm an avid eater and I just barely finished. And not without a MAJOR FOOD COMA after. I slept for about 2 hours when I got home. I would definitely return for the Shrimp & Grits because it was such an incredible combo of flavors, and I would definitely like to return to try the po'boy. But the beignets I would say skip as they are over-hyped for sure. Also, I recommend coming early on a weekday as there's little to no wait. Tip: If street parking, get dollar coins or quarters ahead of time, as it's $3 for an hour. And it's an hour max.

Had quite possibly the best omelette I've ever eaten, at Brenda's.  The Hangtown Fry has oysters and bacon in it, and while the combo sounds odd to me, the flavors matched perfectly.  We also had some beignets, well, actually a LOT of beignets.  I ordered a plate each of crawfish and apple beignet, and we mistakenly got some plain beignet too (we thought they were a free appetizer much like how other restaurants have free bread, but instead apparently the waiter was just confused)- 9 beignets in total!  Each one was superb.  Crispy on the outside, very soft and warm on the inside.  We waited outside on a Saturday afternoon for 25-30 minutes before our name was called on the list, and it was well worth it!

Blog for the pics and full wordiness. Walking up to the line I saw a "sign in" sheet on the door and placed my name...party of 1...below 9 other names/groups. The friendly server told me "it would be about an hour, but we take role call every now and again, so it could be less." Getting in line I, ironically, got into a long conversation with two elderly ladies who were both from Ohio and assured me that the wait was worth it. True to her word, the waitress emerged after 20 minutes (and allowing a few groups in) and called roll - three parties had either walked off or given up and were struck from the list. Another 20 minutes passed and the waitress came out and wrote CLOSED below the two names below mine on the list - no more spots for the day. 5 minutes later, I was finally let in - "is the bar okay?" "Sure." A native of New Orleans and Filipino-Creole raised, I assumed Brenda would be good with the southern style - my question was how this could/would translate into "French technique" especially at a small restaurant with (obviously) limited facilities. Browsing the menu it was hard to find something that didn't sound excellent and although I'd originally planned on a croque madame plus some beignets the daily specials drastically changed my mind...and then I saw the beignets...great scott, they were huge!  This still didn't make my choice any easier given the Croque, the Cornmeal oyster and bacon scramble, the gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelet, the pineapple upside down pancakes, the two decadent sounding French toasts...lets just say Brenda and I would be on good terms if I was in town. The first item to arrive was my flight of beignets - quite frankly I couldn't resist. Starting with "Plain - for the die-hard traditionalist" I must admit I was impressed right off the bat. Delicate and light, warm with a notably buttery undertone yet hints of cinnamon and perhaps clove, these already beat out Kinch's version at Manresa. Finishing only half (to save room) I moved on to the savory. Beignet #2, Crawfish with Cayenne, scallions, and cheddar raised the bar at least two notches (much like what this trip did to my belt size) with its milky yet sharp cheddar complimenting the perfectly prepared and shredded (and mildly briny) crawfish meat - the addition of scallions provided an aromatically pleasing component to the dish while the dusting of cayenne added just a wee-bit of heat - like a great crawfish etouffee sans roux in a puffy shell - where are ya on this one, Hot Pockets? Moving on to the sweets, the third beignet was noted to consist of Granny Smith Apple and Cinnamon Honey Butter. Admittedly an admirer of all things made with cinnamon this was most certainly the beignet I'd been looking forward to most, but unfortunately it was the least "wowing" of the group. Filled with an ample amount of apples, I do fear that the selection was a bit poor and (even for Granny Smiths) the apples were very sour. Tempered somewhat by the sweet honey, the pervasive flavor overall was actually the butter and I fear the cinnamon got somewhat "lost in the mix." The final beignet, billed as being filled with molten Ghirardelli chocolate, was -honestly- stunning. In general not a fan of the overly sweet Ghirardelli chocolates and their lack of subtlety, this concoction was clearly Ghirardelli plus something else - or else a higher end dark chocolate option from their collection that I've not tasted. Strong and potent the heavy ganache blended quite elegantly with the airy beignets - I cannot even imagine eating a full order of these, but one hit the spot quite adequately - I'd strongly recommend these to share for anyone going to Brenda's. Already comfortably sated I could have left here and been happy - but remember when I said I wanted a croque?  Well, I didn't get a croque.  What I did get, instead, was something so much more sublime - one of the daily specials entitled "Banana Bread Pudding French Toast with bourbon pecan sauce and chocolate chips."  Essentially a piece of banana bread that had been saturated/soaked in bourbon custard and then griddle fried, topped with Ghirardelli chocolate chips, and slathered with whipped cream and an absolutely flawless pecan sauce with strong degrees of cinnamon plus subtle nuances of bourbon whiskey - stunning.  Better than the French Toast at Dottie's in texture and consistency and potentially more sweet than that at Griddle café - thankfully I only ordered a half-order (which was, amazingly, charged exactly half for instead of the $2 up-charge at Dottie's and others for half-orders!) Friendly service, water that was refilled long before I reached the bottom of the glass, and a hustling/bustling environment.....oh, and really great food.  I understand why the lines are so long, but if I end up in town permanently I'm going to have to ask Brenda to get a bigger space so I can come back more often!

I have to say, I wasn't a huge fan of Brenda's. I thought the food was good but not outstanding, and definitely not worth an hour and a half wait. I've been to the top 3 (so it seems) brunch places in the city - Mama's, Dottie's and now Brenda's - and I think Brenda's comes in third. Biscuits and grits were awesome, eggs were just ok and the beignets/griddle plates looked good. I was, however, a huge fan of the chicory coffee...I'm a coffee addict, and that stuff was wonderful.

I came here on the sole fact that my name is Brenda, I am part French and I love French soul food.  I had the sampler beignet and I felt that the dough had a heavy oil flavor (like the oil was old).  I also had a po'boy that was ok.  None of their food was STUPENDOUS to me.

oh my food coma. fiance and i went to brendas on sun for brunch. we waited about two hours (fml). but the food was amazing. shrimp and grits was stellar. i don't even want to think about the calorie/fat content of what i ate. it was way too rich so i didn't finish all the grits. beignets are fantastic - the chocolate and apple ones were really yum. the crawfish one was so different yet so good. i'll be back... as long as i don't have to wait 2 hours. in the tenderloin.

I had my 31st bday brunch here and ordered a half order of pecan pancakes, a side of bacon and a flight of benigts (bad spelling) and watermelon iced tea.  The best breakfast ever!!!  I can't help but wish this was next door to me.  I like the new renovation because there is a lot of light and more room.  the quaint small old place had its memories but this looks more organized and had better lighting.

Oh Brenda!!!! How have I not reviewed you yet? ....oh yes, I know why, I've been standing in your line dreaming of the flight of beignets and the shrimp and grits. Where to begin? Brenda's is small, popular and delicious, so the wait is sometimes long....unless you arrive at 8am like the bf and I do (a mutual love of food has led to an earlier lifestyle). Personally, I immediately order the watermelon sweet tea....to die for, especially with the free refills. Then onto the flight of beignets, the crawfish is my favorite, but the apple and chocolate hold a special place in my heart as well. As for the plain, well, I leave that for the bf...gotta be generous sometimes :p  The shrimp and grits is spicy cheesy goodness, my mouth is watering as I type....note to self, go to Brenda's tomorrow morning, 8am! The oyster scramble is my second go-to, but only when the shrimp and grits aren't available. I don't really understand why someone would just order plain old eggs,  but if  you aren't adventurous, make sure to get the AMAZING bacon. It's sweet, savory, fatty perfection....and yes, I order a side of this as well. Despite being in the Tenderloin amid the druggies and prostitutes, Brenda's is the place to go for breakfast....hands down

first off, the wait!. dont go unless you're ready to wait 60+ minutes (at least on a weekend brunch, not sure about weekdays), we waited for 90 minutes on sunday at noon. was it worth the wait? in hindsight, i'd have to say no. entree/brunch items were on par with mamas or foreign cinema (at foreign cinema, you can make a reservation would not have to wait) the food: watermelon iced tea, creative, refreshing, delicious, could be more watermelon-y though for my taste, but im not complaining, free refills beignets, everyone raves about the flight of beignets. i truly believe that this is the main sell pont of brendas. my personal preference, opt out of the flight and opt in for the crawfish and chocolate eggs benedict with fried catfish. typical eggs benedict, nothing to rave about but nothing to complain, the catfish was unique. the potatos that came on the side with the eggs, so-so, nothing spectacular and definitely have had better grits, these were really delicious actually, i dont think i've eaten grits enough to judge them, but they were tasty, especially with the steak/beef thing thats served on the side

BF and I had breakfast here and tried their famous Beignets..They were alright. Tasted like a standard doughnut. I think it would have been better if we would have gotten a chocolate filled on or an apple one. The omelette's we ordered were standard. Not great not bad. The long wait really wasn't worth it in my opinion. I guess I expected something amazing though from all the hype.

i finally got the honors of eating at this grand establishment.  the first time was right before the lovefest, where my bff and i strolled in for brunch.  i enjoyed my eggs benedict, which was delicately laid upon their scrumptious  biscuits -- a nice change from the english muffin.  it had a nice cajun hollandaise sauce.  my bff had the banana french toast, which was tasty, but we both agreed that we would have liked it better if they didn't slather all the syrup on top and put it on the side. next time i came during lunch on a weekday where they serve the po'boys.  i had the vegan josephine, which is their tofu version of a sloppy joe.  very tasty and spiced well.  i added gruyere and avocado that gave it a nice depth and creaminess.  the bf had the oyster po'boy, and he absolutely loved it.  i liked their coleslaw as it was not overpowered by mayonnaise, and had a nice cajun spice to it. can't wait to go back!

After reading all the Yelp reviews on this place, I decided the boyfriend and I had to try this place. He loves southern cooking so we decided that it was worth braving the TL to try this place. And on a Saturday morning, it really wasn't that seedy. We waited a half hour outside the restaurant before we were seated. First, we started with the flight of beignets so I could try all of them. The crawfish beignet was my favorite. The chocolate ones were a little too sweet for my taste. I think next time I would order only the crawfish beignets. I'd read so many rave reviews about the Hangtown Fry that I decided to try it (although oysters aren't usually on my list of breakfast foods). It's a bacon and oyster scramble, which I had with grits and a biscuit. So tasty! The oysters didn't have any fishy taste at all because I think they were seasoned before being scrambled with the eggs. When eating the biscuits, make sure you try the jam that comes in a little pot at the table. It tastes homemade! Like somebody stewed a bunch of strawberries until they became jam. I also tried the watermelon tea, quite refreshing and plenty of free refills! The BF got a cheddar and andouille omelette. That was good too. I liked my scramble better. Great food, hearty portions (well for me), and reasonably priced at $8 per dish. I would definitely go back. Even if I have to wait half an hour in line and walk three long blocks to the restaurant from our un-metered parking space. Oh, and I saw Brenda in the kitchen cooking! I have this thing where I love when I see the restaurant's namesake actually cooking my food!

What you need to know about Brenda's: 1)  It's tiny, and unless you live conveniently around the corner (like I do) and get there within 15 minutes of their opening, you will wait. 2)  That being said, the wait is worth it.  The food is high quality, gourmet, french soul food.  Some of the awesomeness includes fresh beignets, chickory in the coffee, and uber tasty grits. 3)  I have never, ever finished a meal here.  It is so rich, and so filling that it's simply near-impossible.  You will want to finish, but most likely will not. All in all, Brenda's is a nice little diamond in the rough of the tenderloin.  It's awesome that they're realizing such success, because they certainly deserve it.

the best biscuit i ever had...besides being in Texas. came here on a weekday morning and there was already a wait forming at 9am!! i ordered the Andouille and Cheddar Omelette with Sausage, cheddar, mushrooms, scallion, sauce piquant for $9.50. it came with a side of biscuit and potatoes. biscuit was hot and perfectly fluffy in the inside. my butter and jam nicely melted inside and one bite of it made me want to inject the entire thing up my veins! also had to get an order of plain beignets. it was good however, i should have asked for honey. Coffee was dark and strong just like how i would imagine it to be at cafe du monde. as usual..parking sucks...be prepare to feed the meters.

The food here is top notch. It is great quality and flavorful. My friend had the shrimp and grits and I had the creole veggie omelet. We also split some of the plain beignets. The omelet had fresh vegetables in it with just the right amount of cajun dust on top. It was tasty. I also had grits and a biscuit on the side. Brenda's makes their own peach preserves, which were excellent on the biscuit. My friend's shrimp and grits were amazing. It was such a complex blend of different flavors with just the right amount of kick: a little spicy, but not too much. It was just right. The beignets were hot and fresh. Very tasty. If it was not for the wait, I would definitely give this place 5 stars. We came on a Sunday around 12:30 and were not seated until almost 2:00. I will definitely come back, but it will likely be earlier in the day when I could avoid the rush. If you come here, expect to wait. The good news is that there are plenty of decent coffee joints nearby to grab a cup of joe while you wait. If you ask politely, Brenda's will also start a tab for you and give you drinks while you wait. Its definitely worth a try if you have not been here and get that craving for southern soul food.

All were fantastic but the shrimp really shone. I've also been for breakfast and the food is also very good- this is a good place to feed a hangover! Don't miss the watermelon tea, it is very distinct and delicious.

Perfect in every way. Atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, no pretentiousness here. I immediately ordered the watermelon iced tea (came w/ plenty of refills!). I settled on the grilland? w/ grits. The grillands tasted a bit like Filipino adobo w/ the meat being tender, and the gravy being very flavorful w/ green onions and a bit of spice. Service was friendly and attentive. If you time it right, you can get a table after little over 5 min. wait...

I was referred here by a friend as I am not local to San Francisco.  I was staying at a hotel in SOMA and thought it would be okay to walk through Tenderloin to Brenda's.  Let's just say if I wasn't with a group of 5 guys then I would probably have pee'd my pants or turned around and called a cab.  The walk there was intimidating but I guess you can say it was worth it.  The restaurant was very small - probably would be able to only seat 30 people at a time. I ordered the grillades and grits, watermelon iced tea and split a sampler beignet.  I thought the meat was flavorful and the texture was just right.  I don't think you could screw up eggs, pretty standard I guess for over-easy eggs.  I could care less for grits since I am not much of a fan.  I enjoyed the watermelon iced tea a lot - it was a unique taste and best of all, free refills.  The beignet (doughnuts essentially) were tasty but a little bit too sweet for me.  They were not quite what I had imagined them to be but they were still good nonetheless. I think this place is nice to try once or twice but I wouldn't go out of my way again (especially walk through Tenderloin) to come here.

After seeing Brenda's Shrimp Po' Boy as #42 on 7x7's "100 Things to Try Before You Die" list, I knew I'd have to make my  way over there on our trip to SF for my honey's b-day. We went on a Saturday at about 12:30p.m. Our wait for a table ended up being about 45 minutes. This restaurant is super tiny so I'm guessing there's probably almost always a wait. We got seated and knew exactly what we wanted- 2 Shrimp Po' Boys please! On Sat and Sun they only serve brunch and the Shrimp Po' Boy is on the lunch menu but our waitress said they'd still be able to make it for us. The Shrimp Po'Boy was definitely something special- toasted French baguette, lightly spiced fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato and topped with chipotle rémoulade. We went overboard and asked for an extra side of the rémoulade because it was so good. I got my sandwich with fries and the boyfriend got his with cole slaw. The fries were pretty standard, but still good. Neither of us liked the cole slaw, but it didn't really matter because the sandwich was absolutely perfect. We also got a biscuit which was good, but not great. Everyone around us had brunch items which all looked completely amazing. Lunch for the two of us was $31 after tax and tip. Can't wait to go back!!

shrimp and grits are boss. beignets are hard as fuck. i know everyone loves them for some reason, but i'm pretty sure i could break a window with them. the crawfish beignets taste kind of like an upscale hot pocket. hangtown fry is so good. wtf do they put in the biscuits? crack rocks and butter? they fall apart to the touch but they are still probably the best damn biscuits you'll have.

I was excited to try this place and I love the small cozy place with great music but the food was just ok. We started with Crawfish Beignets   and the inside was very good but the outside was gooey with too much dough. The Fried Green Tomatoes  were overpowered by the batter and my option cut too thin. Shrimp & Grits were pretty yummy but maybe just tad too cheesy. BFC was fine, the chicken could have better season kick. The best item on the menu.,..drum roll please...

This place is a true competitor to Dotties.  We went there this morning and had the catfish benedict (on homemade biscuits) and grits with shrimps/bacon.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Many people had the beignets and if wasn't for the fact that I had stuffed my face on the mains, I would have gone for it.  They looked great.  I am crossing my fingers that this place will *not* make it to Lonely Planet ... if not, tourist will crank up the wait from 30min to 1h30min.

God Bless Brenda's Heart!!! When I was in SF last wk end for spring break, my cousin took me here for breakfast before we headed out for wine tasting in the Napa Valley.She has been raving about the cheddar grits and shrimp over the phone for a while now-ohhh the torture, right? I was surprised that there was a long line before the restaurant had even opened its doors. When we were seated, we ordered the cheddar grits with shrimp and crawfish beignets. The crawfish beignets were sinfully delicious- when you opened them they were just oozing out cheddar and steaming fresh! The cheddar grits were creamy and full of CHEDDAR and were accompanied by smokey sauteed shrimp, bacon, and tomatoes on top.  I finished like a good 75% of my bowl because I wanted to keep the other 25% in a doggy bag to have the next morning before heading onto the airplane home to MI.  The watermelon iced tea was good refreshment to sip on since the food was very decadent. For dessert we ordered the granny apple bread pudding, but our waitress brought out the apple beignets which were a little disappointing it seemed like it had too much clover spice in it, but the beignet dough was still a treat. I highly recommend yelpers to dine here- I can understand why it is called Soul Food. Thank you Brenda.End of story.

I haven't even tried the beignets yet, and I still love this place. Not too many vegetarian selections, but enough to keep me interested. I'm Southern, and I always complain about how I can't find a good biscuit in SF, but Brenda's proved me wrong. And they serve peach jam. I love peach jam. The Vegan Sloppy Joe is good, cole slaw is good, but their housemade pickles are to die for. I always ask for a side order of the pickles even if I don't get a Sloppy Joe, and they're always very friendly about giving it to me. I'm also very happy with their House Salad with cajun mustard vinaigrette. It's all good stuff. The place is so tiny that the wait can be tough, but it's worth it.

With over 1500 reviews, I don't know what more can be said about Brenda's. A little overrated in my opinion.  I've been here twice. My first time here was definitely better than my second. It's probably because the first time I waited for a good hour and a half on a weekend and the second time only ten minutes on a weekday. It's all in the psyche. On my first visit I had the Beignet Fight to share, the Catfish Benedict, and a Watermelon Ice Tea. Second time around I had the Beignet Fight to share and the Catfish Po'boy. If it wasn't for my friend, who was craving beignets after her trip to Disneyland, I probably wouldn't have ordered the Beignet Fight again. It's not as light as I like them to be and actually quite doughy. My favorite of the four (plain, apple, chocolate, and crawfish) had to be the crawfish. Then again, I'll choose savory over sweet any day. Catfish Benedict was delicious, especially with the homemade biscuit covered in eggy goodness and hollandaise. The potatoes it comes with is not your average hash browns. I like mine crispy, these are not. Make sure to look for it in the specials, it's not a menu staple. Catfish Po'boy, another special, is your average sandwich, jazzed up with some nice bread and good sauce. Meh. And the Watermelon Ice Tea is just alright. There's construction going on on the opposite side of the wall for an expansion, I think. But drills and pounding on an early afternoon is no fun. They're only worth it if they came from an awesome night before.

My girlfriend introduced me to this place and I LOVE this place! One of the best breakfast places in the city! Their portions are pretty good and the food is very filling, so there's a good chance you'll be taking some food home. The crawfish beignet is a must when you come here! The Hangtown fry is also a good choice if you're hungry. The fried catfish po boy is soooooooo good! As for beverages, the watermelon iced tea...free refills =)

The food here BLEW MY MIND. I have never had more delicious shrimp and grits or jambalaya or beignets before. I liked it so much I contemplated waking up at 7am just so I could be the first person in the door at 8 so I didn't miss my flight a few hours later. The only thing is the neighborhood is totally sketch and I can't see myself going into "harms reach" for dinner. The local crackheads can be a lil scary at times, though they are typically harmless. One told me she liked my jacket and the another liked my sunglasses. They obviously have great fashion sense so they can't be all that bad. Go anytime before sundown and I think you'll be fine.

Went on a weekday for lunch. We got there a bit later, almost 1 o'clock... so only had to wait 10 minutes. Small space but well utilized. I had the Shrimp with grits - this was decadent and rich and all around yummy. It tastes like creamy polenta with butter. I'd only had good grits once... at Denny's... so this blew me away. dining partner had the sloppy Josephine. Again I've never had Sloppy Joes so I didn't have a point of comparison but it was good and he cleaned his plate. Their coffee is enough to make me go for a visit... just for the coffee. It's like the Vietnamese coffee with chicory, strong smoky and sweet. We had the plain Beignets to finish off our meal... each serving of the beignets had 3... I thought it was one... too much food and I couldn't finish my piece. I thought it was fine... I can't say I Loved it but I could see myself having it again. I saw someone ordering some sort of potato side dish and it looked like homefried potatoes... that's on my list for next time.

Sunday morning at Brenda's French Soul Food is a must. All the food is super! Omelets, pancakes, grits, etc are over the top terrific. See you on Sunday. Get ready for a long wait!

Man, this place is de-ee-licious. :) I'll be honest, the beignets are good, but they are no nawla (new orleans) type of beignet - a little bit more cakey/dense than the puffiness of a real beignet. HOWEVER, this doesn't mean it can't be evaluated on its own right. We got the beignet flight - our favorite being the apple one (has a hint of nutmeg) and also the chocolate (well i must say I always like chocolate - but it brought back great memories of having churros con chocolate in Spain - dark rich & thick chocolate). The crawfish is def a good to have one - but i could never have a whole plateful. The outside was slightly too over seasoned - perhaps a bit too much paprika/salt. The inside was great, but also very salty. However, the taste in itself was good and helped to balance the sweetness of the other 3 sweet beignets on my plate. The other dish we got was the grillades and grits - basically a beef dish with grits, eggs, and some good flaky biscuits. It's a lil mushy on the inside (not undercooked) but still pretty good. Definitely no bisquick biscuit. The homemade jam they have on the tables is also very very good, like strawberry butter good [disclaimer: it's not butter]. My suggestion if you want to come here is though to come with just one other person - 2 people get seated a lot quicker than other size tables. This place is def worth the buck - not too expensive, and just the right amount of breakfast ambiance.  Also, another tip: don't get the coffee. Community Coffee might as well be at the gas station. That's one of the biggest downfalls - the two things i judge a breakfast place is on coffee+potatoes (no potatoes this time - had to get the beignets). Bon Appetit!

poboy{  bread = "crap" ;  shrimp = "few and terrible" ;  dressing =  "unorthodox crap" ; } grits = gross crap ambience = too good for this crap beignets = passable as such, but still crap better to not experience 'french soul food' this way. go to yat's and get a poboy and a beer for breakfast. You thank me.

I really wanted to like this place.  Got there early so we wouldn't have to wait.  The room, while small is pleasant and the servers are very nice and competent. The problem was the food.  The grits tasted only of black pepper.  The fried potatoes were extremely greasy without any potato flavor.  The eggs benedict with molasses ham on a biscuit were inedible.  The biscuit was dry and absorbed anything and everything, the ham had no ham flavor, it was just sugary and sauce was not a classic hollandaise, but something salty, with stone-ground mustard and no lemon. We love brunch, love eating in New Orleans where French-Soul means something about the food, but what was happening at Brenda's was something altogether different and not worth repeating.

The line is insane, but its not their fault that the beignet platter is the perfect thing to share with your friends. Although my egg breakfast was good, and the granola pancakes and french toast looked to die for, and I don't really like sweets for breakfast! But the thing I remember most about my time there was that I wanted to shove the little jam jar into my purse and run out screaming 'I have it, I have it!'. I have heard it resembles strawberry freezer jam, and although I don't know what it is, I do know that its slightly fizzy and oh-so delicious.

The first time I came here, I came around 11 and waited for an hour.  Had the Vegan Josephine and didn't think it was fantastic.  With the long wait and not so awesome food, I decided not to come here again.  Now a year later, and hearing again how good Brenda is, I decided to try again. Came here today after 1:30, and I waited less than 10 minutes!  Watermelon iced tea, not that great.  Pretty bland, but there were watermelon chunks.  Beignet flight, loved the crawfish, but I didn't like the other three cause it was a bit hard around the edges.  Shrimp po'boy was just delicious.  It's basically what's going to make me come back again.

Ok the first time I went about a year ago, it was pretty damn good.  It's gotten even better.  The place was packed.  In all we had the Beignet Flight [all 4 types of beignets...wow] and my friend ordered another order of the crawfish beignets and cancelled the pancake he ordered.  i had the Grillon and Grits and it was flipping amazing [tender steak, brown onion gravy, butter grits, 2 sunny side eggs, and a huge ass biscuit that I couldnt finish but was sooo good.  The gumbo is solid but needed a splash of hot sauce to liven it up.  Overall, it was in a word, orgasmic.  Go there, put your name on the list, don't be in a rush... you're dining with Brenda, baby!

Probably like a 4.75, but I rounded up. Um so basically...this place wins for best brunch/breakfast place I've had thus far in SF/Bay Area. Only been here two times, but it's pure quality and pure goodness wrapped in amazingness. So the first time I came here I was a huge Yelp whore and looked at what everyone order (and it was helpful) but I didn't really go with what I wanted...mistake. Well I started with watermelon sweet tea and the Flight of Beignets (or is it Beignet Flight...maybe I'm thinking of Flight of the Conchords). The watermelon sweet tea is so good. I want to try to brew my own, but I know it won't compare. The Beignets were alright - apple one, Ghiradelli chocolate one, crawfish one, and the plain one. They were just...normal fried things which are usually...but it's something to try! So get it just in case! I liked the crayfish one! So then I ordered the granola pancakes (why...I don't know), and then my brother order the Hangtown Fry (bacon/fried oyster omelette). The granola pancakes were...granola pancakes. They were normal. But good. But I should've gotten something better than that. The Hangtown Fry though...that scramble really hit the spot. Please do try! Oh I came at like 8 am on a Tuesday or something really obscure like that so there was no wait! Yay! Okay now the 2nd time I came here, me and my best friend decided to come on Sunday at like...12:00...didn't get seated until 2 PM but honestly who cares. We walked around the Tenderloin, embraced the characteristic smell of urine, went to Civic Center and had a day. So we decided to be extremely fat and spend cash on this meal considering the wait time (so we went hard) - ordered the garlic shrimp over the cheddar grits, blueberry cream cheese French toast, and the oyster po'boy! Well...the food came INSTANTLY! It was AWESOME! Because it's so small, they have awesome service. So the grits were...insanely, intensely flavorful! So good! The garlic shrimp are covered in like this...bacon-grease, fat, whatever sauce of goodness. The cheddar cheese was so melty and delicious. It was perfect to resolve anyone's savory-esque craving! This stuff was intensely good. The oyster po'boy...well the oysters were fried to perfection and crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside! The sauce they put on was like...I want to buy it. It was yummy, along with the coleslaw, but I wouldn't order this as the absolute first thing I ever ate here if that makes any sense. The blueberry cream cheese French toast...holey moley it was like French toast on meth. They were FOUR GINORMOUS pieces of French toast except EIGHT pieces of bread because they would use TWO pieces of bread and put cream cheese in the middle to make one piece of French toast. And then there's this yummy, sweet blueberry compote on top with blueberries (obviously) and PECANS (this lady honestly knows wasssuuuup, this chick should be friends will Paula Dean on the Food Network). Then they put it with a wittle cup of whipped cream. Honestly...it was great. Best French toast I've had. Although after I ate I did run out of breath when I was walking up a hill and felt kinda like two of my arteries were probably clogged and that I was possibly going to collapse, it was worth it. Go here.

I absolutely love Cajun food but I've never eaten any quite like I have at Brenda's French Soul Food. I keep going back to this restaurant for the delicious and authentic Creole flavors--I just can't get enough! Among the delicious fare I've tasted at Brenda's are the crawfish beignets (a delicious New Orleans-style doughnut), Creole veggie omelet (fresh and tasty), and the oyster Po-Boy (with a tasty chipotle sauce). Oh, and to wash it down with a watermelon iced tea, what could be better? Every time I go, I make a point of trying something new and really, I've never been disappointed with my order. I've heard that Brenda's also caters. I'm seriously thinking about hiring her to make some entrees for a party I'm hosting because it's quality, unique food. Brenda's gets really busy, especially on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. But trust me, it's well worth the wait.

Brenda's French Soul Food is fabulous!  Everything you read about on all of the reviews are totally true.  Watermelon Ice Tea was refreshing.  Best of all, it is unlimited refills.  By the time I left the restaurant, I had 3 cups!  Beignets were good as well.  My favorite is the Crawfish.  For those who likes their beignet on the sweeter side, the plain is fabulous!  The apple was ok.  Chocalate was a bit too sweet and the chocolate was not melted enough inside.  On to the main course, grits, eggs and all basic brunch food was good.  I ordered the CatFish Po Boy and that was yummy as well.   All in all, great place.  Would go back any time.  I would recommend going with just 2 people - since they only have like 3 tables that seat up to 4.  Parking is a pain too - meters are $0.25 for 5 minutes or something crazy like that.  Just park up on Franklin (2 blocks) where parking is free. Can't wait to go back to try the Oyster Po Boy and the yummy crawfish again!

iPhone Yelp directed me to this small breakfast venue one morning in SF.  Looked cute from the outside, and packed on inside = must be good.  Although I had to wait a few minutes (even being a table for one) to be seated after signing my name on the wait list outside, it was well worth it. I had coffee and the french toast with buttery toasted pecan sauce.  WOW was it delicious and well-presented AND inexpensive.  It was almost too much to finish, but I forced it since it was so good.  As long as your party's not too big, this place is a must for breakfast.  Definitely try the french toast WITH the pecan sauce. Seating was a bit sparse.  I was seated at the end of a bar next to some decorative plants.  The food definitely made it worth it though.

So I have been hearing rave reviews about the food at Brenda's and I am always looking for a good creole restaurant so I happen to be off during a weekday so I decided to go have breakfast.  So I get there and was seated right away so I ordered some coffee and juice.  After looking over the menu I decided to go basic and just ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, grits and biscuits.  I was pretty excited because I really love grits but I know that they have to be cooked correctly or they can be just awful.  I took one bit of the grits and the consistency was correct but they were the worst tasting grits I have ever had!!!!  I don't know how they were cooked or what they were cooked with but they tasted stale and just WRONG!!!  The eggs I asked to be cooked hard but not browned and definitely not runny.  The eggs were not cooked properly and they tasted like fish!!!???!!!  That was an assault on my taste buds...the only part of my meal I wound up eating was the sausage and the biscuits which I should add were just fluffy goodness!!  I was going to order a beignet but decided against it because all I wanted to do was get the taste of the fishy eggs and those awful grits out of my mouth.   Maybe I will have to go back and try something else but first impressions make a lasting impression and I will have to think about giving them any more of my money.  I am so not impressed.  I have to wonder about the taste buds of people in this city!!!  There is truly no good "Soul Food" in the city any longer....very sad!!!

Ooohh bebe! Being from the deep South, I am always on the hunt for great Southern food. So I brought a friend that I grew up with in New Orleans to try it out here at Brenda's. It's a small place, be expected to wait. But, they have CC's!!! Maybe next time I'll have to ask if I can have a cup of chicory brewed CC's while I wait. Wouldn't have mattered, I was so excited in anticipation of eating food. So my friend and I ordered with our eyes and not our stomachs. But it was so worth it. *CC's - nice taste of home. *Gumbo - FTW. no joke with this one. Beautiful roux. *Shrimp and Grits - a bit on the super buttery and heavy side. Not quite like home. (Believe you me, I like my butter and I like my grits, but it was a bit overkill for me) *Red Beans and Rice - not bad... beans and sausage cooked well... could have used a bit more flavor. *Po-Boy - mini-fail. I won't say complete. You can only do so much with out the right bread. I missed the bread that cuts through everything... There's more on the menu, but we did the best we could. The savory beignets looked interesting...

The wait was ridiculous.  We arrived at 11 and didn't get in until almost 2pm.  But the food was amazing.  I had the eggs Benedict with the spicy hollandaise sauce sooooo yummy.  I also had a chance to try the shrimp and goat cheese omelet, it was amazing.  We had a group of 6 and thought we were never going to get a chance to eat.  Go in a group of 2 of less if you want to eat sometime that day.

I always heard that food tastes better when you are starving...This was certainly not the case for this establishment.  Food was okay, not great or amazing...If it wasn't for the miserably cramped quarters and 2 hour wait time, I would have written this one up with a high 3. We knew there would be a wait when we tried this place but we had no idea it would be 2 hours for flippin' brunch for my and my husband.  An offer of coffee or a small piece of pastry would have been a welcome sign for the 30+ people waiting outside and it certainly would have held back the impending headache I was getting from not eating.... Finally we were seated...at bar stools...with little leg room and oh, yes a full wall mirror so we could see how sad and hungry we looked.  Not my cup of tea...overrated place and will not be back. Yelp, you have let me down.

Brenda's is awesome.  The Crawfish Beignets are pure bliss.  Their coffee is much better than most restaurants.  My omelet was delicious and the potatoes rocked!  Great biscuits. I tried my friend's grits and they were a little too buttery for my taste.   We were there on a Friday morning around 9:30 and we had to wait approx. 15 minutes.  Not too bad.  It's a small place so a bit crowded.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be going back.

Favorites: butter biscuits, homemade jam, melon tea (free refills!). So glad I tried it.  Rich!  The sides were more interesting the mains.  It was like having grits with my butter- made it hard to eat because it was overly rich.  Might have been an inconsistency because the grits on the second person's plate were fine. Really want to go back again to try more.  Heard about the line and wait list.  You have to pick the right time if you don't want to wait.   Small.  Getting to the bathroom you had to really manipulate yourself around people battering fish, frying,  and cramped poles and corners.  The kitchen didn't seem to appreciate me going through.   Difficult to have parties of more than 2.  I can see how parties of 4 can be an issue.

So you know how they say that restaurants are all about value?  I recently went to Brenda's with a "larger" group of 6.  We arrived to the restaurant and parked at 8:30am on Saturday morning.  We put our name on the waiting list and were third behind two groups of two. After waiting for twenty minutes, the people in line ahead of us seated, we were next up.  But were we?  Nay, we were not.  Apparently despite five other groups of two and three leaving the restaurant, more than making room for us, the host fellow decided that the five groups behind us should go in first.  Even the group of FOUR! An hour into the wait we were finally allowed in by said host and sat down to enjoy the meal. I was less than impressed with my omelette selection, but the gumbo, beignets and grits were tasty.  I had the anduille omelette and a friend had the moque choux (less than perfect, more of a corn salsa) and neither of us were outstanded.  We wanted to be, we weren't.   I will try it again and hopefully it will be better than last time.

Loved the food - started with granny smith apple beignets and ended with oyster and bacon hang town grill with cheddar cheese grits... so food was awesome... BUT... What I was not happy with was the cleanliness of this place - not the inside but the outside. Just because they are located in the Tenderloin does not give them license to not sweep and power wash the sidewalk out front - especially because this is the waiting area in which groups of people stand waiting for their name to be called. The sidewalk was disgusting, with all the trappings of the Tenderloin, fecal material, drug scraps and all. C'mon Brenda, buy a power hose and have someone clean the sidewalk every mornin'. It's your responsibility as a SF business owner!

The crawfish beignet was AMAZING. I also had the fried shrimp po'boy (on 7x7's top 100 things to eat in San Francisco before you die) which was delicious. The fried chicken also did not disappoint.

My friend Stephanie and I decided to eat lunch here today, so we could be one step closer to finishing the 7x7 list. She's been bugging me to come here for DAYS, so I finally gave in even though I'm not a big fan of soul food. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated, considering how popular this place is and how small the dining area was. Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately felt claustrophobic. The tables are spaced so closely together that you would think the couple next to us was eating WITH us. The place also didn't have air conditioning which would have been perfect on this hot, blistering day in SF that felt like the REAL first day of summer. To add to that, the bathroom is located past the kitchen in the back, so in order to get to it, you have to go past the steaming hot grills, apologize to the cooks for being in their way, and be at the risk of getting burned or knocking something over. I'm warning you: PROCEED WITH CAUTION. We ordered right away since we knew what we wanted even before arriving. We decided on the Crawfish Beignet, Gulf Shrimp Po Boy (7x7), and Sloppy Josephine. The Crawfish Biegnet was this hefty donut looking thing with chili powder sprinkled on the outside. The dough had a pretty hard and chewy texture which was a little turn off for me. The filling was much better; you could really taste the ocean in the crawfish and the melted cheddar cheese really gave it a kick. I had really high expectations for the Gulf Shrimp Po Boy since it made the cut for the 7x7 list. To my dismay, it proved to be nothing spectacular. The sandwich is served to you open-faced with battered shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and thousand island dressing on top of toasted bread. My first reaction was, "how am I supposed to eat this thing??" I think they couldn't close it either and that's why they left it open for us. I ended up just giving one of the bread halves to my friend instead of closing it and cutting it in half, which would have been disastrous. The dish was also served with french fries which were nothing too special except for the fact that they were skinny fries, which I love. The Sloppy Josephine was by far my favorite out of all three dishes. They gave us a nice helping of the meat and placed it in between two toasted, buttery buns. The meat in the sauce was very flavorful and perfect in every way. On the other hand, the dish was also served with coleslaw that lacked flavor and mayo. Before we left, my friend decided to order the Watermelon Iced Tea that almost everyone in the restaurant was drinking. After taking a sip of it, I can see why. You get both the distinct taste of watermelon and tea and together they work perfectly. Very refreshing, indeed. Overall, the food was good, but nothing too mind-blowing. Don't believe the hype people...

Right or wrong, I've had mouth watering dreams about Brenda's Vegan Josephine.  The Baked Brie en Croute that I've ordered once before was pretty tasty as well. I've lucked out and never had to wait to get a table here either which makes the trip more than worth it.

This is one of my favorite brunch spots in San Fran.  I've been both times I was in town.  The beignet's are a must.  They have a plain, cinnamon apple, chocolate, and a crawfish.  They are all solid and I got the flight both times, but next visit I am just sticking with 3 crawfish ones.  This has to be my favorite thing here.  Last time I was there i mad a stupid choice with my entree thinking i should take it light after getting the beignet's.  This time I corrected it and got the hangtown fry.  This is a fried oyster and bacon omelet with a side of potatoes and buttery moist biscuit.  Get here early and don't worry about the wait, its worth it!

Since Brenda's is open for dinner, I thought I'd check them out. Let me first say that their redesign was successful. On the one hand, the layout is not as charming as it used to be, but on the other hand having nothing but deuces lined up on either wall does wonders for flexibility. Even though they're constantly busy, the wait isn't as interminable as before. I've also got to say that Brenda's heart is in the right place. I am sick to death of so-called soul food places with hedge fund pricing. This food is supposed to be working class and Brenda's understands that. I also appreciative that my watermelon sweet iced tea was constantly refilled without me asking. I haven't seen that done outside of the deep South. And there is no attempt to make the food healthy. They ladle on the butter here. And you've got to give Brenda's points for consistency. They have a few things that are very, very good and the rest is mediocre at best. And it's been that way since they opened. I had a couple of fried chicken thighs, mac'n'cheese, greens, and a biscuit, the aforementioned watermelon iced tea, and a deep fried sweet potato pie with spiced pecans (yes, I know I'm a pig). First, the good. The greens were tender with a nice smokey flavor from the meat (ham hocks? tasso ham?). The iced tea was great as always and the biscuit is the best in the Bay Area, hands down. Too bad the chicken was inedible, dry and tough (these were thighs!). Even the skin was tough -- that's a first!  I didn't know that was possible. The mac'n'cheese was mac in white sauce with a thick skin of cheddar on top. Not in least bit sensual the way good mac'n'cheese is. At least it wasn't the glorified Kraft out of a box most places have. The sweet potato pie was basically a beignet with sweet potato filling. Not inspiring the way a good sweet potato pie with a crusty pecan top can be. The waitresses are an unhappy bunch, which is probably not surprising considering the working class prices. No one's getting rich here, except maybe Brenda. I'll eventually come back and try some of the other offerings, but I won't be in too much of a hurry.

Make some time for Brenda's because you're looking at an hour plus wait. Speaking for myself, it was totally worth it. With my wifey and visiting friend from New Zealand, we decided to try as many dishes as humanly possible. On our table: Fried Catfish Po' Boy Sandwich, Fried Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich, Black-Eyed Peas with Rice and Andouille, Collard Greens, Gumbo, Biscuits, and a Beignet Flight. Oh yeah, each of us had Sweet Watermelon Tea. Yes, we did finish all, despite getting some awkward stares. This is some of the best southern cuisine to date. The food is easy on the palette- no overwhelming spices. Standouts are the Po' Boys and Black-Eyed Peas with Rice and Andouille. The Beignet Flight is the way to go because you get a sample of each kind (4 total). Thank you Chef Buenviaje! The small space and soul music makes the dining experience very homey. Maraming Salamat Chef Buenviaje!

Oooooooh weeeeeee. Now I ain't no soul food expert of any kind but I do like to eat and I know what's good. For me at least. So last night, my cousin and I went to try Brenda's in the TL. Great choice! The place is very cozy like and roomy enough but not too big. Good ambience. As soon as we got there, the waitress was quite attentive and very hospitable. It was hella cool coz I knew off top that she was gonna be on top of her game, and she was. For starters I tried a cup of chicken andouille sausage gumbo. They sure don't skimp coz it was a hefty cup with alot of sausage and rice and veggies. My main course was a shrimp po boy sammich with some cole slaw on the side. I counted at least 10 chubby shrimps in my sandwich at which point I told myself that this was the real deal. No weakass, skimpin' on some tiny shrimps in this po boy. They ain't f*ckin' around! I ain't tryna blow up the cole slaw but we all know how it could be really bland and just there, as a mediocre side. Not Brenda's cole slaw. It was flavorful and complimented the sammich quite well. I wanted to try their hushpuppies since they are a French soul food joint and I was not disappointed. Both the hushpups and the po boy sammich was layered in a creamy chipotle sauce. WINNER! I can't forget the little serving of spicy pickled watermelon rinds. What?! Yes, spicy pickled watermelon rinds. It came in a tiny dish of 3-4 along with the main dish. I've never had it before but my tastebuds was feelin' it! After devouring all that goodness, I thought, well, at least it felt like I thought I could take on dessert. So I ordered some beignets. I thought, okay, I can eat A beignet but little did I know the dessert version came with 3 baseball sized beignets. Plain, chocolate filled, and apple filled all on one plate. Whew. I just stared it for a good 2  minutes and decided that I was gonna take it home coz my stomach was telling me kill that noise right now. I really dug Brenda's alot. The background music was a solid mix of oldies from Motown to, "Please, Please", to "Cool Jerk". It kept me in the eating mood! Shoutout to the awesome waitress who answered all our naive questions and constantly kept my glass of water filled! See you soon!

I made a mental note to swing by Brenda's one of these days after hearing wonderful things about the place on--you guessed it-- YELP. After our original plans fell through, I suggested that we try this iconic San Francisco Treat. We were quite surprised at how small the place was, though I was forewarned that space was very, very limited. In fact, this place is so simple and unfussy we drove by it 3 times without seeing it. We placed our names on a clipboard and patiently waited for our table. And when I say patiently, I mean patiently. We even sent out two of our clan members to go search for nearby eateries that were Yelp-friendly and line-free, after feeding the meter for a second time. After failed attempts and a scary encounter with a pantiless prostitute, we scurried like frightened little lab mice back into the safety of Brenda's warm restaurant-front. After an hour of waiting, we were finally seated. We basically knew what we wanted (um, we had an hour to decide--HELLO!). We ordered two Fried Oyster Po' Boys and three Fried Catfish Po' Boys. We devoured it and even licked our plates (not really, but just settin' the stage here). The Po' Boy sandwich is basically deep fried seafood (your choice of oysters, catfish or shrimp) with tomatoes, lettuce, and a chipotle remoulade sauce tucked inside a grilled french roll. it comes with pickles on the side and your choice of fries or slaw.  The meal came out to about $62.00, with tax and tip. One of us ordered the sweet watermelon tea which was refreshing, but I personally could not stand because I hate all melons, even the water variety. The Po' Boys were $9.50 each, which most of us thought was a fair price for the dish. We unfortunately could not try Brenda's infamous beignets as we were stuffed, but we saw many people ordering this house favorite. The staff was friendly, particularly the brunette and the guy--very helpful and quick on their feet. The wait was a bit annoying, but there is a sacrifice for good food, I guess. The girls felt that the Po' Boys were filling, but the guy in the group found the sandwich to be on the small side. He felt for that price, they should give bigger portions. I do have to agree since an order of soul food in my area can feed a pack of hungry teenage boys. Final Verdict: Get in the door before they close at three, feed the meter 'cause parking's not free. Come tired, poor, or hungry, just expect the wait, the Po' Boy might not fill you up, but it's still great!

getting here was a slight adventure, but it was SO worth it.  perhaps the most decadent breakfast (or meal) i have ever had.  watermelon tea?  yum. and really, everything seemed so..  fluffy!  the eggs, the pancakes, the biscuit.   okay, the grits were a little "meh" but then again, i have never had grits before.  i don't even really know what they are.  maybe i just don't like grits? the tables are really close together, and the people next to us got some sandwhiches.  i couldn't stop drooling as i discreetly stared at them while they ate.  it smelled AMAZING.

Best biscuits ever.  I searched the menu several times to find a breakfast option that merely consisted of half a dozen buttery delicious biscuits, but I settled for an order of egg whites and some potatoes with my biscuit.  Next time I am skipping my front of eggs and just getting biscuits and bacon!  I feel like Paula Deen.

Brenda's is a dream come true for anybody who loves delicious food.  I have not had a single thing here that I have not thoroughly enjoyed and worshipped.  Seriously, everything here is amazing.  My favorites (if I had to pick) are the crawfish beignets and the eggs benedict (only available on weekends).  Their hollandaise sauce is a special cajun recipe and is out of this world.  I could never get tired of the grits and biscuit sides either - they remind me a bit of Kenneth Parcell from 30 Rock - they do their job to make sure you are happy but don't steal the show or cause any problems.  They recently expanded their menu and have delightful additions like BFC (Brenda's Fried Chicken).  It's crispy and seasoned just right.  Their watermelon iced tea is AMAZING.  Everything here is great.  I feel I may be getting a bit repetitive so here is a list of things I have tried and would recommend: shrimp and grits, french toast with butter pecan sauce, hangtown fry,  andouille and cheddar omelette, gumbo, brie en croute salad. The only downside is that there is usually a huge wait to eat here but luckily I live nearby and can order it to go.  Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about Brendas.  Brendas - please, never ever ever change (unless it's to add more space, seats, menu items, hours, etc.).

Yesterday, on Leap Day was my nephew's 40th (10th Leap Year) birthday and he and his wife chose to eat here for lunch along with his mom (my sister).  It was a great choice since I haven't been.  OMG.  The chicken, sausage & okra gumbo was sooooo good.  I shared a cup with my sister and it was a teaser.  We both had ordered the jambalaya special with their house salad.  That was delicious, too.  I got to sample the fried chicken that my nephew ordered and also the rice & beans with the andouille sausage.  The plain beignets are delicious, too!  BTW, their watermelon tea is awesome.  Great food!  It was so good that I had to go back today (the next day) for lunch to get my own big bowl of gumbo again and I brought one of my friends to try it out, too.  She's pretty picky about her food, but asked to sample the gumbo, and she ended up ordering her own big bowl.  The ambience is nice.  The service was excellent yesterday with an attentative waitress who was also friendly; however, today, a different waitress and not as joyful like the one yesterday, but I secretly wished & blessed her lots of love so I wouldn't trip on her attitude (I'm usually a big tipper, but this one got the bare minumum)...overall, great restaurant in the tenderloin!

I take back my intial review of this place, thank goodness Brenda's is back open on Sunday! I went in for Sunday brunch with my mom. it was absolutely amazing! We both got orders of gumbo which had a great taste! and ordered the watermelon iced tea. The tea had actual watermelon in it which, sounds weird, but was actually superb...and we got continuous refills. For the meal I got the special, banana bread french toast which turned out to be real pieces of banana bread with chocolate chips inside, made like french toast then drizzled with whipped cream and carmel sauce. I did the best thing by getting the carmel sauce and whiipped cream on the side since, as you can tell, the meal was extremely RICH! very dessert like rather than breakfast but a nice occasional treat never the less. Ive heard that there is usually a wait...luckily when we went we got the last table. When we left, there were about 3 parties waiting outside and the counter was full. The place is small and a little cramped but that's what goes with any none chain restaurant. The food is good enough though that i trust Brenda's will eventuall grow to open for dinner and possibly get a larger space...i hope so at least! I will be going back. probably for take out however since i dont want to fight for a table in that neighborhood.

Dee-licious. It was a Thursday afternoon after 1pm and there was still a 30-40 minute wait. That's a good sign. We started off with the beignet flight. It comes with their 4 signature flavors-plain (good), apples & cinnamon (meh), chocolate (heavenly) and crawfish (the winner!). For our main dishes, I had their special BBQ pulled pork po'boy with fries and he had the special crawfish and andouille sausage pot pie with a side salad. Both were really tasty. We had their watermelon  iced tea which didn't do much for me. It was lukewarm, so maybe if it had more ice in it I would have enjoyed it more. Total cost of our meal was $41 including tax and tip. Overall it was a great experience. Staff was friendly and service was pretty quick. I'll definitely be back. Now, it's time for a nap...

When I posted there were 915 posts with a 4 out of 5 stars. I am wondering is this even necessary? Okay, I'll do my Yelp duty and report my findings. Just a bit of background on this Yelper. I grew up in the south. My family is from Louisiana and Georgia. Dishes like gumbo and jambalaya were holiday treats. So when I give Brenda's a five, I hope that it means something. Funny fact-These folks must have stole some secrets because I haven't seen a person who looks remotely creole in this establishment. Great brunch that's worth the wait, cause you will wait. It's small, cramped, and in the TL. I tried to mention the drawbacks because everything else is so great. If you decide not go, that's fine because the wait will just be shorter for me.

Wow - this might have been the highlight of my meals during a recent trip to San Fran - it certainly wins the most unexpectedly delish meal of the journey.  Went there on a weekday morning around 9am and the restaurant there was plenty of seating (although by the time I left an hour later it was JUMPING!).  Ate like a little piggy, starting off with the beignet sampler.  The chocolate and crawfish were personal faves, although all of the fresh out the fryer treats were sooo tasty.  For my breakfast main I had the shrimp with goat cheese omelet with bacon tomato relish.  It was really good - the tastes and flavors really complimented eachother.  The fluffy biscuit was good, but for me the real highlight was the grits.  I've never tried grits like that before - they were more of a yellow hue (as opposed to the white color I am used to) and they tasted so much like corn it was really so good!  I'm sure the butter and whatever other high caloric ingredients helped make this tasty side a highlight for my tastebuds. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!

This one is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Wait at 9:30 on a Saturday was about half an hour. Restaurant is tiny, so this makes sense. We got a beignet flight to start, and they were great - piping hot, nice crunchy-to-soft ratio, and the fillings yummy. My personal favorite was the chocolate filled one, but really, no surprises there. Main orders were pretty much just ok. I enjoyed my creole veggie omelet, especially the hash and cream biscuit on the side. Biscuit was perfectly flaky, and with the butter, it really hit the spot. I sampled some of my husband's florentine benedict, and while it was fine, the hollandaise was so overwhelmingly rich and creamy, you could feel your arteries clog as it entered your system. Our friend tried the shrimp and goat cheese omelette and wasn't sold. Our server was a bit crabby, but seemed to lighten up later. We emerged into the sunlight to find that the waiting crowd had swelled to maybe 25 people. A popular weekend spot, for sure. But I'm not sure I could eat this kinda food often.

To be honest, I feel like this place is over-hyped. I'm torn between giving this place a 3 or 4. My friends and I ordered their beignets, fried oysters, fried shrimp, fried chicken, and fried catfish. The beignets are definitely worth trying, but I feel like they were too-heavy. I wasn't satisfied with their fried meats and seafood either. For the price we paid for each dish (roughly 10 dollars) we didn't get much, and the flavor of the breading overshadowed the actual taste of the meat or seafood. I really liked their free-refills on their watermelon iced tea.

A friend and I wandered over here on Saturday because we had heard about their brunch. On arriving, we found a line larger than my ego, all waiting out in the cold to get in! This place is tiny so you need to arrive early for brunch people. Like get there at 10.00 in the AM on a saturday if you want to eat before 2.00pm cause otherwise you are doing what we did ..signing up on the list outside and wandering around the tenderloin till you get a table. But once you get in side..its all worth it. The food is amazing! I had the Egg and Bacon Tartine (8$). It has this tomato sauce on top that is just about the best I had tasted anywhere in the world. The Beignet Flight ($6) which had (4) yummy beignets. The crawfish one was the absolute best. Fantastico. The coffee never stopped pouring and you will be amazed watching Brenda run about the room along with the rest of her all woman staff. This place rocks. Definitely going back but this time hoping I dont have the one hour wait time. One star less for the wait time.

Wow! Already 320 reviews! Simply the best restaurant for breakfast in the City. I always try to get to Brenda's early. Before the line starts to form outside the door and all the nearby parking spaces are gone. I've lived in New Orleans, and this place really has it down. You can't get better beignets anywhere. All the egg dish's are great, and they serve the best pork sausage I've had in this City,(or anywhere else for that matter}. The server's can be over worked when it's full, which is nearly always, so it's better to not be in a hurry when you eat here.

I arrived, long line and the wait was looking like 40-50 minutes but so many people left and we were called soon enough. I think my experience wasn't common but they forgot out order so we waited about 50 minutes seated and If you have been there, you'll know it's as big a bedroom, it's obvious who is eating and who is seated. Finally after seeing 3 couples who had been seated after us and left before us, we Got our food. It was good, but worth the wait??? No, typical breakfast place, greasy, fatty, and overpriced omelets. Only thing  worth waiting and eating are the "authentic" Soul food is the beignets. But  as for breakfast, same as usual, nothing to write home about. Oh yeah, id be nice if the waitresses smiled and apologized to us after the wait, but they didn't and that doesn't help this review. I wouldn't recommend this place to any friends or collegues. But it doenst matter, they have a loyal following. Go at your own risk;)

Yes, this place is really good. We started with the beignets. My fav is plain. I tried the chocolate but it's not my thing. The shrimp & grits bathed in tomato bacon sauce was scrumptious and huge. Love love love the sauce. I went with some good friends and we had lots to talk about. Our ridiculously large party of 5 waited 1.5 hours in rainy weather. It was another 1 hour until our food was on the table. The plus side of the long wait is many people won't wait it out. By the time their name is called, they've departed. Philz is closeby so I was able to get my coffee on when we realized how long we were gonna be out there. And at least I'd already had my coffee BEFORE we got screamed at by a man insisting we buy his 2 containers of Bud's ice cream. It's a bit of an SF scene. Many groups of people standing around, hoping to get in. Sometimes applause and cheers break out when a party was finally called. Once in, this tiny place makes for very close seating. One of our group had someone's butt right up against him as we were sitting near the counter. He didn't seem to mind, but her husband wasn't too happy about it. I would definitely go back to this place, but with no more than 3 people. Or, I would order to go. They seem to be expanding as construction is happening right next door. This might make for a quicker turnaround.

Another long overdue review. First had their crawfish beignets (sp?) right before Lent and of course I give-up fried food for Lent. I was hooked and enjoyed every bite. Regret giving one to my co-worker, but devoured the other two. You get three big ones for a small price. Now that Lent's over, I just might have to go back and try the rest of the good eatz on their menu =).

I took my family there on June 11, 2012 at 2:45. I didn't realize the restaurant close at 3 however the waitress made it "CLEAR" we close at 3:00.  She was rude during our conversation per closing.  No kids menu and the food isn't' good for a 1 year old, 4 year old, and 6 year old. To add insult, I ordered a "Sloopy Joe" and told the waitress it wasn't good. The waitress took it off my tab however with an attitude and told me other customers had no issue with it.  I kindly stated my opinion and left her with no tip. I had gumbo which was fabulous, grits to much butter, hush puppies was below average, sloopy joe not good at all. I grew up in Mississippi which my aunt cooked soul food and my father is from New Orleans. I'm certified when it comes to good food.  I assume most Californians don't know what Real Creole & Soul Food is. The waitress was horrible with a major attitude!

We got there really early like everyone suggested (on a Monday) and there was no one there.  So I don't know if it's only certain days there is a line or not.  We split the beignet flight as an appetizer of sorts and they were all amazing.  I wasn't sure what I'd think of the crawfish one but it was really good, all of them were.  Then we got a standard breakfast and it was really good.  I wish the molasses ham had been a little more flavorful and I'd gotten the bacon the hubby got.  But it's not enough for me to knock any points off of the rating.  Would definitely go back if we ever made a trip back.

I visited Brenda's this past winter.  I loved the Beignets...  INCLUDING the crawfish beignets which I thought sounded strange.  The Shrimp and Grits were also perfect.

Amazing the watermelon ice tea is delicious. The servers all share tables so i think we were asked to take our order 4 times before we ordered. My friend and I were trying to catch up but they kept interrupting us. Definitely, a eat and jam kinda place. The food was a great taste of Louisiana in SF. The crawfish beignet was my favorite. The cheese grits were a great compliment to the crawfish. A great breakfast spot.

Overrated! Place is super small, the wooden seat benches are way to high for the table and very uncomfortable to my behind. Ordered: crawfish bignets, hangtown fry, shrimp and grits and gumbo. -crawfish bignets-  doughy, dense and not enough crawfish mix. Felt like eating an old fashion doughnut. Thumbs down -hangtown fry- bread tastes like its been sitting in a cupboard for a while, homefries are good and the fried oyster mixed with the eggs is interesting. -shrimp and grits- Ewwww! Awful. Too rich and there was a crap load of cheese in it. Getting this dish was a total turnoff. Who wants to eat this while there's a thick orangey-red oil floating on top? One scoop and I couldn't eat no more of this dish. Thumbs down -gumbo- ummm... Had better. Didn't hit the spot. Thumbs down Felt rushed while eating but really slow service when collecting your payment. I don't think I'll be coming to this spot again since there's nothing that really caught my tastebuds. Overrated and had better soulfood... Not sold on Brenda's... next

I can't believe you people wait in line for this nonsense. Brenda's takes soul food and transforms the idea into turds on a plate. I ate here for the first time two years ago, and was entirely unimpressed. I thought two years was a pretty good waiting period, so I tried it again. If I don't keep it constrained to bullet points I'll write a book about this crap. So here we go. 1. Atmosphere: Gets a pass. They're doing some construction. 2. Service: 3/5. They were, for the most part, as attentive as they could be given the crowd. Although it took three tries to get a biscuit added to our order. And at one point the waitress TOOK my empty coffee cup instead of refilling it. She was gone before I could say "What the hell!" and it was about 15 minutes before I could get my coffee back. Otherwise, they were OK. 3. Coffee: 2/5. Let's not get all excited just because there's chicory in it. 4. Food: 2/5. Soul food my Southern ass. Sausage gravy A) does not stay liquid at room temperature and B) does not have green freakin' onions in it. Sausage, flour, milk, salt and pepper, STOP. How do you screw that up? If a dish is centered around scrambled eggs, please season the damn eggs. And who the hell puts cheddar in cheese grits? I didn't have the begniets this time, because they were bland and boring last time. I did, however, have a "Cajun Bloody Mary" which is more like bullshit in a plastic cup. I have never in my life had a sweet bloody mary, and the dry rub seasoning around the rim of the glass--excuse me, PLASTIC CUP--didn't help. And lukewarm water? Really? If you're not gonna give us ice, could you at least use the cold side of the tap? The biscuits and potatoes were great, but sorry, I don't score based on side carbs. All in all, my girl and I paid almost $60 for a completely unimpressive meal. No more of that.

love the biscuits here! i initially thought i had finally found a secret brunch place sans ridiculous line out the door because the first couple times i came here, i only had to wait 5 min to grab a seat.  sadly though, the last 2 times i tried to pop in, there was a huge line down the block :( in the past i've had their scrambles and omelets and tried a few bites of their pancakes.  all good. in any case, the biscuits are my favorite (steaming warm and buttery on the inside, nice golden top - not too crisp, not too soft - ella's has good biscuits too, perfect with hot chocolate).  worth waiting in line for if you've never been.  i've never tried the beignets but it seems to be the thing to do (split them with a friend though).

I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and countinue singing the praises.  ABSOLUTELY worth the wait.  Incredible gritts, they were awesome!  I got the creole veggie omlette with goat cheese and asked for a side of the sauce piquant to go with it, was sooooo good.  Loved mixing the sauce with the biscuit and gritts, it was like an explosion of mouthwatering flavors in my mouth, ridiculous.  The side of potatoes also rocked.  Service was good, but not stellar, otherwise I'd give this place 5 stars, but just on food, it gets more than an A+, everything everyone has written is true.

yay, i finally got to come here for brunch today.  we didn't get here until around 1:45, so we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  the place is TINY and very cute, so a wait is inevitable. my bf got the veggie omelette w/ a biscuit and potato hash.  the biscuit is so buttery and flaky and delish.  the potatoes were delicious as well, as was the omelette, which had a creamy corn concotion filling.  he also got a sweet watermelon tea, which was interesting w/ fresh watermelon and basil.  there are free refills on the tea, which is a plus. i got the oyster po boy w/ cole slaw.  it was very good as well, but i would have liked a shrimp one better (the specials of the day were oyster and fried catfish).  the french roll was really soft, and i loved the remoulade.  i think i'll try a breakfast dish next time tho. to finish off, we had to get the chocolate beignets, and we just split one after the hefty lunch and took the other 2 home.  the coffee here is good too...very thick, and the cup is huge.  it was a good thing the sunday farmers market was going on at the civic center, so we were able to walk off our meal to and from the farmers market!

Fantastic brunch place. My friend and I waited for an hour but the catfish po'boy was worth it - very scrumptious. I was neutral about the crawfish beignets (they are giant though), but the plain sugar ones were great. They're literally the biggest beignets I've ever seen. The coffee was yummy as well. I'm a bit sad there was no shrimp & grits on the menu though. Maybe that's not entirely creole/cajun.

Yummy! The flight of beignets were delicious, but overly filling! I was soo excited to try the chocolate beignet, but little did I know that the crawfish beignet would totally win me over! It's delicious, not too oily... and very flavorful! I could eat two or three of them !! My Po' Boy sandwich and the omelette was a decent sized portion and were good! Only issue is this place is tiny, and usually a very long wait! Service was alright; we had to flag her down a couple times! We'll def be coming back, when the wait isn't too crazy... LOL

Rainy Thursday Afternoon= Good time t go to Brenda's and not experience a wait. Walked in and had our choice of seating, there was three other parties in the restaurant. We both had the Apple cinnamon Beignets...super delicious and not excessivley sweet. Apples were fresh and coated in cinnamon. The beignet was light and dusted with powdered sugar. I had the Scrambled egg with Gruyere Cheese, Bacon Tomato Relish, Crispy Thick delicious Bacon on top of a grilled french roll. Accompanied by some very creamy grits topped with melted cheese. I thoroughly enjoyed my food. My brother had the Pulled pork with sweet potato hash. with eggs over medium. His was tasty...however it was like a mashed sweet potato sort of thing and not quite what we had envisioned. Was hard to really taste the pork. while it was good it wasnt great...and he will definitely try the frnech toast next time...which sounded so good. My only complaint...my coffee could have been hotter. Will definitely be going back, hopefully we will have the same luck with the lack of wait time.

Oh Brenda's! Is Yelp making you too popular? She wasn't even there this weekend cause she's back home for Mardi Gras. I can't believe a man and his pregnant wife waited 1 hr and 41 minutes to get seated, they must have came around noon. That's insane. Nevertheless we settled for some take away and those biscuits are the perfect teaser to make you want to go back. Flaky and warm with homemade jam. Yum.

I got the sampler of beignets, and they were amazingly good. The watermelon iced tea IS as hyped up as it's supposed to be.

The food at Brenda's is unbelievable... unbelievably healthy, but comfort food is supposed to be, right?  Unfortunately, the wait is unbelievable too, but once you get seated you'll forget how agonizing the wait is.  It's a good thing I don't live anywhere close to this place, because if I did I'd come here every other day and probably be 50 pounds heavier by now.  My husband and I ordered the beignet flight, fried catfish eggs benedict and croque monsieur.  It was our first time trying beignets, and they did not disappoint us.  The plain and crawfish were our favorite.  I'm really glad we shared the catfish eggs benedict because it was good, but really really rich.  We opted to pair it with the savory, buttery grits (also our first time trying that).  The croque was your standard croque, can't go wrong.  And don't forget to try their refreshing, refillable watermelon sweet tea!

i'm not the kind of girl who waits in lines outside places. vegas clubs, san francisco clubs, buffets--not sure what else, but no! i refuse to wait! but my visiting 10+ year friend came to visit and insisted. so i waited on the sidewalk for an hour, like a plebeian. but damned if it wasn't worth it. fried catfish eggs benedict. fish fried to perfection, tasty hash. flight of beignets, decadent and even tastier later. spicy and gooey crawfish beignets to go. unlimited watermelon tea! hot damn. hot damn. next time, i will bypass all that madness (but really good service inside), and GET TAKEOUT. i am certain this will be the key. get takeout. get beignets. get watermelon tea. get catfish. I'M GOLDEN.

Thanks to reviews from my fellow yelpers, I was so excited to try Brenda's. And as usual, y'all did not steer me wrong! Location- the only negative I can think of for this place. The neighborhood is a bit shady, but not the worst in sf. And they close by 3pm, so how bad can it get, right? Also, it's a small space (max 40) but that can be a good thing too Food- everything was great! Watermelon iced tea- yum! It's a light, refreshing drink. And by light, it's not super sweet and the tea was mild. Best part is free refills! (I'm assuming it was free. I didn't pay) We all shared the sweet potato pancakes to start. Holy moly cajoly. They were thick, light and fluffy, and topped with a sweet pecan sauce. Absolutely no guilt here haha For entrees we had the oyster Po boy sandwich and the beef strips with 2 eggs and grits. My DH said his sandwich was yummy but there was lots of batter covering his little oysters. The cole slaw was light and fresh. I shared the beef with my cuz. The beef was a bit on the not so tender side but the spicy creole sauce over it was delish, as were the creamy grits and biscuit. To top the meal off (and no, we really didn't have any room left by now), we shared the beignet flight. My advice, start with the crawfish one as it is savory,with a cheesy spicy filling and little chunks of crawfish and scallions, sprinkled with a spicy creole powder on top. Next have the plain, then the apple and last but not least, the chocolate. Let me break these down for you. The plain was ok, plain. The apple cinammon filled one was delish, but I have to say it tasted like a malasada (think leonard's in Hawaii). Ditto with the chocolate one. It was yum with it's bitter dark chocolate, but again had that doughy consistency of a malasada. I can forgive the doughiness for its creative fillings. Service- good. Wait- 45 minutes for a table of 3 at lunchtime. Go after 1:30pm and you won't have to wait Nonetheless we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back to try the sandwiches, and other guilt-free items ;)

Went back to Brendas this time had Cheesy Shrimp and Grits! It was a bit spicy for my palette, VERY cheesy which I liked but VERY Rich! I think if I ever get it again I would share it and ask for it to be less spicy. Catfish poorboy was good but I can pass, I liked the shrimp poor boy I had last time better! Staff is friendly and all was good!

You know...it was good. Real good.  But not OHMYGAWD great.  We went after 2pm on a Saturday so the wait wasn't more than 10 or so minutes.  Make sure you bring quarters cuz all of the parking in the area is meter parking for $3/hr.  It's a very small place where the waitresses shimmy between tables all day long.  I noticed Brenda's was also a popular spot for parties of 1. I can't say I've really experienced soul food before, moreover french soul food.  We asked the neighboring table if the beignets were worth ordering. They advised us they were more dense than light and fluffy so we opted not to.  I love my light and fluffy.  I decided to go with the bacon and egg tartine with a side of grits.  It was all pretty delicious but I especially enjoyed the tomato bacon relish.  So much that I asked for an additional side of it.  The portions were quite generous and my meal was very savory.  He had the sweet potato pancakes which were a bit on the sweet side for our taste.  The pancakes alone we enjoyed but they were drowning in so much syrup we could feel the cavities forming. The first pancake really made our taste buds dance and eyes widen but without a bite of my tartine to break the sugar high, the remaining pancakes were difficult for him to swallow down.  The watermelon iced tea was very refreshing. We probably wouldn't make a special trip back out to Brenda's, but maybe if we were in the neighborhood and without a wait, it would still be a good option.

4 stars on the food. Read more to find out about the extra star...oooooo...not really but keep going.. So I go to sf way early in the morning to pick up an exhaust for my car, since I was using the lady's car I promised her we'd go to a nice breakfast. My spontaneous self didn't plan ahead (let's just call that spontaneous instead of forgetful), so I get on my iphone and find this place, looks good so we drive to the spot. There's street parking but everywhere we parked was for only one hour max and each hour cost $3 in change...sorry I'm not a bum I don't carry that much change on me at one time. There's no parking garage that does it hourly around the place, so we ended up circling the area for about 20 minutes before we find a spot right across the street from the place. I figured that if I get a ticket at least I'll be able to see it before it happens so I can stop it from happening. Luckily, I start putting in coins and the meter goes to out of order, woooot, I'm in the clear. I put a post-it on the car and we head to the Brenda's. Write your name on the clipboard outside hanging on the door, wait 15 minutes (at least in our case), then you get seated. Place is really small with a few tables and very cramped, but that plays into the whole ambiance of the spot. The workers are pretty chill and probably wired from all the hustle and bustle with no rest. For breakfast we got two of specials of the day, one was shrimp and grits and the other was scrambled eggs with fried oyster and bacon with grits and bacon. To drink, we had the watermelon iced tea and hot coffee. And to start, the granny smith beignets (doughnut with sweet shit stuffed in them), yum. The food was really greasy, really cheesy, and really delicious. The shrimp and grits had this bacon sweet sauce in the middle that covered the shrimp...seriously soo good. The food is just really homie and all around comfort food, definitely a place that requires stretchy pants. So overall, the food and service was 4 stars. Food was very hearty and tasty but not mind blowing. Then why the 5 stars? Well, admist the meal putting me in food coma and giving me grease quivers I left my phone on the table. One of the waitresses runs outside to hand me my iphone...so nice. To be honest, I would've jacked that shit hahah. Mad props to this place of honest hard working people making food that make my jeans tight (no homo).

My friends and I were visiting SF for the day and decided to go here for a snack since two in our group were raving about the crawfish beignets at Brenda's. The place was packed, and it was a relatively small restaurant so we just ordered to go and stood outside to eat the crawfish beignets.  Let me tell you, they are ridiculously  delicious!!  It is definitely on the top of the list on the yummers scale.  As you bite into the warm dough, you are greeted with a creamy and savory filling with a taste of the spices coated on top.  There was about 8 or 9 of us and everyone gobbled it all up.  If they had this restaurant in LA, I would definitely be a frequent customer for the crawfish beignets.

During my weekend trip up to the city, I yelped what places to eat at. This was the highest rated place by my hotel, so my wifey and I walked to this place on a Sunday morning. The neighborhood was empty, because everyone in the area was inside this cozy little cafe. I usually hate waiting for a seat, but the reviews said it was worth the wait. We waited 15 mins for a table, which was really good, because within minutes of our arrival, 10 more parties signed in on the chalkboard on the wall. I love southern food, so we went all out and got an order of crawfish beignets which were amazing except for the fact that maybe half of it was dough. It was still delicious. I was going to get the french toast, however asking the regulars who were sitting next to us told us to skip it. They recommended the andouille and cheddar omelet which was delish!! The prices here are pretty decent and the food is soul-full. It is definately worth the wait!

ohh brenda's, were you really worth the two hour wait? to cut into that savory crawfish beignet and see it ooze and steam out on the plate.. definitely! to put that first bite in my mouth, not knowing what to expect, deliciousness.. definitely! on the other hand (i'm still not over it even though i ate there 3 weeks ago) my poached eggs were overcooked! how are you going to have eggs benedict where the egg yolk doesn't waterfall all over your dish only to be sopped up with each bite you take? definitely a FAIL! you ask yourself, why not order the tasting flight of beignets, it's only a few dollars more and you get to try all of them. trust me guys, the only good one on the plate was the crawfish. the chocolate was thick, the apple was ok and the regular was too oily. not only that, but we had to wait so long even after we ordered. longer than the people who were seated at the same time AND 10-15 minutes after us. and the grits, it was ok, so rich and creamy that you really can only take two or three bites of it and be sick of it. i left feeling fat and grumpy. if i had it my way, next time i'm ordering an order of the crawfish beignets to go and that's it.

Here's what we ordered: Watermelon Sweet Tea Beignet Flight Jambalaya Beef Grits (done with scrambled eggs) The watermelon sweet tea was so refreshing it almost, almost made up for the wait.  The wait was ridiculous for middle of the week, mid-day eating, but the food is delicious so I guess it's partly justified.   The crawdad beignet was sooooo good!  The others were too sweet for me as an appetizer, but the chocolate would've been good maybe to  finish off the meal if we weren't so full.   The beef grits were solid, but not amazing.  If I ordered it again, I would've done it with eggs over easy.  The jambalaya was delicious as well.   Worth taking a taste, but just thinking about the wait makes it hard for me to want to go back.  It's comfort food so it's nice, but there's nothing there I'd yearn for except maybe the crawdad beignet...

I don't think I ordered the right thing at Brenda's because the food honestly did not knock my socks off. While the beignets and the croque monsieur were both satisfactory, the fries and po'boy were meh. The fries were bland and tasteless and the po'boy was unmemorable. The good news is that when we visited for lunch a month or so ago there was only one group ahead of us so we were seated right away. Brunch seems to be what everyone is raving about, so Brenda's deserves another visit at least.

I had a surprise brunch for my birthday here.... BEST birthday brunch EVER! The beignets were amazing (my personal favorite was the crawfish one) they were so fluffy but had a crispy shell. Then I ordered the trout with mashed potatoes = amazing. The potatoes were sooooooo creamy and fluffy, it was perfect. The trout was flaky and flavorful. Even the coffee was great. It also helped my experience, that there was virtually no line. But, then again I went on a Tuesday morning. I can't wait to go again!

I'll echo what others have said.   The line can test your patience, but the wait is well worth it.  Try the flight of beignets for starters.  The French Toast with butter toasted pecan sauce is plate lickin' good.   The Gulf Shrimp and Goat Cheese Omelette is really good too.   I'd also recommend the Sweet Watermelon Tea (a house specialty).  Do yourself a favor and go to Brenda's today.

I was VERY impressed with this restaurant.  Their beignets are AMAZING!!!  My friend and I shared their flight of beignets, and we thought that by far the chocolate one was the best!  But all of them are spectacular in their own right! :)  We also shared some pancakes that I want to say had cranberries and oats in it, and it was okie....  Not my cup of tea, BUT!  the watermelon ice tea is AMAZING!!! MMM MMMM!!!  Just be weary... this place is tiny and packs up fast, so get there early!

Although this place is small, there's a reason the wait list can be over an hour on the weekends, the food is great and the portions are pretty large. I came here with some friends for breakfast one Saturday and didn't notice the lack of elbow room once our food came out, I was too distracted by the biscuits calling my name. I'd most definitely go here again, and I'd make sure to get there a little bit earlier to avoid the wait.

Since this place is right around the corner, I have had many meals here which made up for my first over cooked oysters experience.  A few of my favorites are the banana fosters french toast, the braised beef cutlets, and the salad with baked brie.  I always wash it down with the insanely wonderful watermelon tea, and sometimes double fist it with a cup of their deep dark chicory coffee.  I would eat here every morning if i could.  Thanks Brenda's!

after a string of great brunches in SD, i was once again showed the powers our great chefs of the bay area.  chef brenda whips up some seriously good stuff here. as expected from all of the great brunch places in SF, there's a bit of a wait as no reservations are taken.  once our names were called we were seated at the counter and that's when we realized that not only does this place have a very cute setting but it's tiny! we started w/ the plain beignets and were very pleased w/ how light and oh so sugary they were.  i got the french toast w/ the butter pecan sauce and i have to say that this almost rivals the french toast i had at brockton villa in SD!  the sauce was just off the chain.  everyone needs to eat this.  it's that freakin good.  my wife had the buttermilk pancaked w/ fresh fruit and this is as good pancakes get.  nice and light and very tasty and since the fruit was so fresh, no syrup was needed!  we also ended up getting a side of potato hash which was very good but needed a tad bit more salt. as far as i'm concerned, this is a new institution for brunchy goodness and i can't wait to try every little thing on their menu!

i don't remember how i came upon this place while looking on yelp for a place to lunch, but im glad i bookmarked it and actually set out to try it. the words "french soul food" really intrigued me. what the heck is french soul food?! i don't think i still quite know what it is, but allll i can say is it was pretty darn goood. this place is pretty small though. definitely do not come here if you have a large group, actually make sure its just a pair! no more than 2 people to be exact. i see alot of people ordering the gumbo, omlettes, and the croque monsuier sandwich. but i decided to order something i've never had before: the fried oyster poboy sandwich. very interesting to put oysters in a sandwich. not my favorite sandwich ever, but nonetheless still pretty good. i wanna go back one day for breakfast and try their omlettes. **note: get a glass of their watermelon sweet tea! hmmm.. you'd definitely want seconds. next time i'll ask if they give free refills, i wasn't too sure.

Where can one find great French Creole Soul Food, without going to New Orleans and dealing with the floods, violence, and poverty? I know where! It's on Polk in between Turk and Eddy! Its like New Orleans without the flooding! It's called Brendas, and you chef is coincidently named Brenda, I wonder if she was aware of that. I had trouble finding the restaurant originally since once confusing it with a smoke shop selling "water pipes". The inside is absolutely tiny, I feel sorry for whoever ends up sitting on the  mirrors, because one should never be able to watch themselves eat! It's repulsive and leads to outright vagrancy of humanity. Brenda's is lucky I'm not gonna deck stars out on the layout and look! I did dock a star for the Watermelon Iced Tea. As we all know, all brown people watermelon and picking tea. Now combine them and you have a happy camper. On top of that, the yelpers were in awe of the Watermelon Iced Tea which raised my hopes up. Unfortunately I set them way too high and now I am stuck in a pit known as disappointment (ed. worse metaphor ever). The issue at hand is the basil. Originally I thought it was mint, which I abhor (Thank you "One Word a Day" Calender). Instead it was basil, which absolutely does not belong in a refreshing beverage. There is a hint of greatness in the tea, but the basil ruined it for me. Now enough of the Haterade, and time for the praise! No doubt about it, the biscuits are heavenly, flaky, soft, and buttery. I got the Hashed Beef and potatoes which was made with real corned beef cut up into the potatoes and onions with eggs. I have only been to one restaurant that has done Hashed beef right, and now I can say I have been to two restaurant that have done Hashed beef right. Let's also not forget the Beginets, I may have not spelled it correctly, but laziness has overtaken me. All I can say that the crawfish and plain Beginets should be top choice for visitors. Sweet and savory for all with the perfect amount of spices on the crawfish beginets. You will also find typical breakfast fares such as pancakes, and french toast. Didn't get a chance to try em, but I will bet you my 1987 Celica, that they will taste better than any breakfast you had from Denny's or Ihop!

Always wanted to try this place...it looks busy everytime I'm at my buddy's car shop two doors down.  Over the weekend, I finally got to try them...twice. The first time was Friday, we showed up about 20 min before closing and they happily seated us.  Even as they were wrapping up, closing the register and cleaning, there was never a sense of being rushed.  They waited on us past 3pm as if it were still noon.  We started sharing a cup of gumbo, which was awesome.  Very smoky, a strong presence of herbs or some kind of leaf, good hearty portion of sausage and chicken.  Very nice.  My GF ordered the Poboy even though I suggested otherwise since I'm not such a fan of them.  To my surprise it was very good with big juicy shrimp instead of the small, bland popcorn variety and a very nice remoulade.  My Croque Monsieur was, in a word, awesome.  If there exists such a thing as a gourmet, grown-up version of a grilled cheese sandwich, this is it.  You can't eat it with your hands though because it's put in the pan with a layer of cheese on the outside.  Without out a doubt it's the prize of their menu.  Even their fries are good, almost McDonalds-like. We were so impressed that we went back for Sunday brunch.  And again service was great though they probably remembered us from a few days before.  We started again with the gumbo and it was better than before, less on the herb-flowery taste.  This time I went for sweets with the Banana Bread French Toast off their specials board.  It had chocolate chips and came drizzled with caramel.  They went too light on the egg wash so it seemed like just a slice of banana bread.  All the sugar was a bit overwhelming and I had to dive into my GF's Andouille Sausage and Cheddar Omelette to balance it out.  The tomato base sauce they put over the top is money, almost pasta sauce-like.  And the biscuits are fresh and flaky too.  Be sure to have a glass of their sweet watermelon tea.   I'm very glad they are just a few blocks from my place.  Other than Naan-N-Curry around the way, the eatery scene in this area ain't all that.  And even though the dining room is a bit smallish, Brenda's has won themselves a regular-to-be.

So I'm kinda sheltered. The closest to soul food I've ever gotten was Roscoe's. LOL. Brenda's kept getting great reviews on Yelp (the ultimate culinary source) so I decided to try it out. Besides, Brenda's in the TL so I'm like, its got to be authentic! My crew of 3 headed over for Sat. brunch. When we arrived, there was a line and a wait. I don't like either but secretly that entices me more. It makes me think that these people are willing to wait for something gooooood. So after about 25 mins, we finally got a table... right next to the window! Yayyy! People watching opportunities are always welcomed. We started with the beignets sampler. I wasn't too keen on the crawfish but the apple cinnamon, ghirardelli chocolate, and plain beignets were delicious! Perfect for sweet tooths. For my main dish, I choose the hashed browns (it might have been a special?), eggs, and biscuits. I know, nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't like the hashed browns but I think it was more because of my preference rather than their cooking abilities. I really don't like green onions but they had a ton in the hashed browns. If that doesn't bother you, you'd probably like it. My friends had the french toast and grits (thumbs up) and the hangtown oyster scramble. The french toast was pretty basic and the scramble was a weird combo for us. So I think Brenda's would have been pretty good if we had ordered differently. I'd probably go back and ask the waitress to recommend something. Wait staff was excellent, parking not so much, and price came out to about $60 (average).

I'm still thinking about the food here. I came there on Thursday around lunch time and the wait was only about 10 minutes. This place is small. I mean really small. And small means loud.  But that's cool with me. I know how that might bother some people. The food was served super quick. It seemed rushed a bit but it also seemed that most diners were in a hurry for their lunch hour. I had the special crawfish pot pie. It seemed a bit small at first sight but my belly was bursting by meal's end. I also ordered the beignets and okra and I really liked everything. I will definitely be coming back and ordering less food. For everything I ordered I thought the bill was rather inexpensive. I think I may even get stuff to go next time.

Never knew this place existed until today. Came here for lunch with some friends and I was surprised how good the food are. We probably waited for 20 minutes (very small place as well as popular so get there early) until we were seated. We were immediately served and I ordered the fried oysters Po'boy, while my friends ordered the BBQ Po'boy and Molasses Pork chop with fried eggs and sweat potatoes mash. We also ordered the flight of beignets which consist crawfish, chocolate, apple, and plain. All of them were delicious. The fried oyster po'boy was delish, crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside and the french roll was light enough that it did not weigh me down. Overall the experience was wonderful. Now all Brenda has to do is make the place bigger.

SOLID food. The catfish benedict was amazing. Absolutely Amazing. I am not a huge fan of their potatoes (you can get grits or homefries... I would say, go with grits). The Watermelon Iced Tea = bombin. The Beignets? AWESOME - the crawfish was good if you're in a savory mood, but I would recommend the Apple Pie one - it makes you think of the south & a warm summer night. Prices were decent ($9-$12/plate, $5-$8 for the beignets). Get her early. Parking is difficult, the line gets long anytime after 9:00 and you'll get incredibly hungry waiting outside and smelling what's going on inside.

A lot of over hyping from my friends...leads to disappointment. 6 friends and I arrived around 9am for some french breakfast. The lady laughed in our face when we wanted a table for 7, so she gave us the next best thing, two tables near each other. No one else was in line but a couple small parties started to form while we were eating. Having no idea what beignets were, and looking at the other interesting items, I decided on the peach cobbler pancakes. This was pretty good, but was too much of the same thing. I would def split dishes with a friend for some savory and some sweet to mix things up. It basically tasted like the top of a crumb cake with some peaches thrown in. My table also got the crawfish beignets (3 pieces). These are like fried little banh baos (b/c of the filling), but chewier and super saltier! They're a little difficult to cut up with a butter knife too. The taste improved after i brushed off as much cajun spice as I could and ate it with the jam on the table. Also tried my friend's watermelon juice(tastes JUST like watermelon, but would be nice if it was colder) and grits(SO much cheese and oil!). If you don't touch it after a while, it starts to settle....nasty right?! But I mixed it up and ate it any way. I thought it was really heavy and soul foody...but I wouldn't crave it. I wouldn't crave any of this but I'd eat it if it was in front of me. ya dig?

i've been living in the south, so i know what shrimp and grits is suppose to taste like. how is it that brenda's french soul food does a better job at shrimp and grits in SF ?!?!? this place was as big as my bedroom, yet the food was absolutely incredible. yes their watermelon tea was wonderful, but their coffee is just as good too. i got the omelette and hash which was very good. my friend had the shrimp and grits. i got their assorted beignets and an order of shrimp and grits for my cousin and his girlfriend who gobbled it up in nano seconds. go early, be ready to meet your neighbor's body parts. we sat by the booth and i thought my bottom was little too close to my neighbors shoulder. go in small number 1 - 2. my friend and i were seated almost immediately, but a group that arrived around the same time were still waiting when we left. no reservations, so just be prepared to wait in the TL.

I got to Brenda's early in the morning so I wouldn't have to wait in a line cuz I've driven past there every weekend and every weekend there are a bunch of people waiting outside.  I have to say, it was good but not all that great.  I had the apple beignets and they were pretty good and filling because they were so big. I also ordered the pancakes which weren't anything special. I think next time I'll go when they have brunch as they have a better menu selection. The staff was really nice and very flexible as I had to leave right away to make it to work.  The restaurant was very nice but small. I will definitely give them another shot.

My favorite brunch place ever.  Recommend process: enter; get a table; order chicory coffee and orange juice; follow up with beignet sampler (bring at least 1 friend for this, 3 is recommended).  Split the beignets between yourselves, but be sure to leave room for the main course.  The entrees are large enough to split 1 between two people.  If you like oysters, go with the Hangtown Fry.  It will change your world.  For the better.  Follow up process by profusely thanking your server for the joy she has brought to your table and life, paying up and tipping well, and then evacuating for the towering queue of people waiting for your table while shooting you shiftily envious looks.

Before I went there I know nothing about soul food, never been to New Orleans either. So grits or beignets are all new to me. The wait was rather long and the food took a long time, the food was ok, a little too heavy for me, but maybe that's how soul food should be. Overall it was an ok experience, I'm not too sure if it's worth the wait.

This place is very good. I was really impressed with the beignet (spelling) they make. I ordered a catfish Eggs Benedict and I was quite impressed. I felt weird trying to take a leak and going through the kitchen since it's so packed. It was at a pretty odd location. It's funny that I drive on polk multiple times a week to hit up 101 and I never noticed this place until today though I kept hearing great stuff. I think I need to try the lunch sandwiches first before I can change my overall star rating. It's too bad they can't serve lunch until 11 AM and by then I hear it's an hour wait minimum on weekends :(

The wait is long and the neighborhood does suck.  The dining room is tiny.  You have to squeeze through the kitchen dodging open flames and hot skillets to get to the tiny, tiny, bathroom.  But it is worth it.   Breakfast food or lunch food was a HUGE dilemma as the menu contained many of the crescent city and soul food favorites I had been craving (fried seafood po boys, grits and grillades,  black eyed peas and collard greens) along with a wonderfully appealing creole-inspired breakfast menu.  I opted for breakfast.   We started with the beignet sampler, which was all varieties of fried gooey goodness.  My omelet plate that followed made me swoon--perfectly cooked eggs, perfectly browned and spiced potatoes, and--the piece de resistance--the most delicious fresh out of the oven biscuit I have ever consumed.  It was brunch heaven.  The lack of mimosas might have bummed me out on a different day, but it was New Year's Day, so alcohol was not really a concern.  Besides that, the only down side for me was the coffee, which is the authentic New Orleans stuff with chicory.  (After 3 years living there I never thought it was anything other than awful.  Then again, most people stick to the au laits, that are more milk than anything.  I like black coffee and chicory adds nothing to that flavor.)  The staff was also very friendly, including the owner/chef who was sweet when I had to squeeze by her to get to the john.

If I didn't have to wait for close to two hours for a table, I'd give it that extra star.  That being said...there's a reason the wait is that long---Brenda's is a GEM.  Traveling from DC, I have to chose my dining experiences carefully.  Brenda's has a menu that reminded me of my college days in Atlanta and some good ole biscuits and grits were just what I needed.  I started with the watermelon sweet tea, which didn't taste much of watermellon--I think they could have used a fruit in season--apple would have been nice---but it is a good concept.  In the summer when watermelon is in season, I can see this being a solid win.  My friends agreed to the beignet flight--1 plain, 1 Ghiradelli chocolate, 1 apple, and 1 cajun crayfish.  The dough is denser than the beignets you'll find in New Orleans, but that crawfish one...YUM.  After everyone tasted it, I claimed the rest for my own.  Forgive my selfishness---but oh, that was good!   We tried 3 entrees, the Hangtown Hash (special of the day with bacon and oysters hash), Egg and Bacon Tartine, and the Eggs with Andouille Sausage.  They oysters in my hash were far and few in between and slightly overcooked.  The Egg and Bacon Tartine was by far the best entree...something about the bacon and tomato relish just pulled the dish together and cut through the richness of the Gruyere cheese...mmm.  Do not make the mistake my friends almost made---ignoring their biscuits.  These biscuits are exactly what souther biscuits should be...seemingly dense, yet light and fluffy when split open.  With a dab of butter and strawberry preserves...they should NOT be overlooked! What was really impressive about this tiny place is that the crowd stayed pretty constant right up until closing at 3pm.  Brenda's seems to have a dedicated following and people know the drill well--put your name on the list and hang out on the corner while you wait.  For anyone with a little extra time on their hands...join the line, the people are friendly and it's worth the wait.

Definitely a fan of the crawfish beignet! Love their watermelon iced tea too (I read you get free refills but I didn't get mine). Did not like the over 1 hour wait. This place is REALLY small and be prepared to be squished. I had my butt elbowed several times by the diner sitting behind me at a table while I sat at the counter. I had the Creole omelet which was ok. I tried the other beignets too but preferred the crawfish. The plain was good too. Service is a little slow.

Arrived on a rainy Sunday morning at roughly 9:45am for brunch and there was a substantial line waiting outside the place.  After a 40 minute wait (not too bad), the 2 of us were seated.  The restaurant is small, but great atmosphere - definitely cozy. After much thought and discussion, we ordered the flight of beignets, egg/bacon/tomato relish tartine w/ a side of grits, and a cup of gumbo (all to share).   The beignets arrived piping hot and looking delicious, in order of preference we liked the crawfish, apple, chocolate, then plain.  It was fun sampling each and every one, although I will say that these beignets still don't hold a candle to the beignets at the Cafe du Monde in NOLA.  I most likely wouldn't waste stomach space on these again...Especially when there are so many other things on the menu to try. Then came our main entrees - gumbo for me and the bacon/egg tartine w/ grits for the husband.  The truly standout item was the grits!  These were the best grits either of us have ever had - my husband is from the south, he said he's always hated grits because they are bland, but even he loved these grits.  They were super creamy, smooth, perfectly seasoned and had a beautiful aroma of corn.  I really could not get enough.  As for the bacon and egg tartine, the tomato relish is a really great touch and the eggs were really fluffy, but you can't really go wrong any time you add bacon to the mix.  As for the gumbo, this was very delicious, extremely authentic and down home, I think it's actually better than the gumbo I've had in NOLA.  The chicken was tender and delicious - in my opinion, chicken in stew is not very good because the chicken always comes out flavorless, tough and dry like chunks of eraser - that was not the case here.  I really enjoyed both of these meals. Next time we go, we will try the sweet potato pancakes and the BBQ shrimp and grits. Note: This may have been obvious to everyone else but me,  but if you ever want to walk to Brenda's, don't do so thru the Tenderloin (Up Eddy St).  We made that mistake this morning and had hookers/druggies/drunks and other wack @$$ people all up in our business... Luckily it was all worth it, cuz the food and the service made up for it in the end...

Brenda's always, always has a line.  And as a breakfast/brunch place, I've never had the time to give it a shot till recently. Sure enough, we had to wait to get in and eat, because Brenda's is quite small inside.   But the food is very good and very plentiful.  It's also fairly priced, especially given the generous portion sizes.  Now I can see why some people are willing to wait in line for it. We actually had enough left over to bring some home.  And it was equally good the next day.   Brenda's is the real deal.  There aren't many places in SF that I am willing to wait in line for, but this would probably be one of them. The ONLY caveat I would have would be the waiting in long lines.

I came on a sunday once at almost 3pm and there were 50 billion people waiting in line so I was like no way! A friend came into town the other day so I took a Wed off and we hit this place up, arriving at 10:50am and walked right in and got a table! Everything sounded so good and wanted to try everything, good thing that there were 3 of us so we got a good variety. We tried: Crawfish beignets -came in 3, good, gooey with bits of crawfish and a spicy creamy sauce inside (salty) gumbo- a cup is easily enough as an appetizer for two, we also got a bowl and that was waay too much for 2 people to share, its more like a entree portion! very good and probbaly the best that I have had, salty though. granola pancakes- portions were huge, and this was a different twist on the normal pancake, a bit dry but good, with lots of fresh fruit toppings shrimp grits with a bacon relish sauce and chedder cheese-need I say more? This was a special of the day and it was so rich, too rich after everything above we ate first. I ended up taking mine home. fried catfish sami-good, came on a huge bun with some nice crispy (a little too salty fries, the fried catfish could have been bigger, it was a small small filet deep fried in the sami, so a bit disappointed, but the fish inside was very good. Just wish they gave us more! Prices are reasonable, and the omletes looked good too. Watermelon sweet tea is OK, I don't think it was worth it. The banana foster was good too-at the other table, I think I will get that next time..... as for the wait, when it got to be about 1130ish there was a short line outside already..... As for waiting for almost 2 hours for this place, I personally wouldn't have, its good, but not that good. Certainly food that you really couldn't eat everyday (I worked out twice today, thus) as its so fattening! A good place with great food, overall, but not worth my 5 stars yet!

The biscuits here are incredible.  The Watermelon ice tea was amazing as well--and I hate tea.  The Shrimp/goat cheese omelet was great.  The fried oyster frittata from their specials board wasn't impressive.  Nothing special about the potatoes so it's better to get the grits instead.  Came here around noon on a weekday with a party of 2 and didn't have to wait for a table!  Love a place that serves breakfast all day.  The portions are HUGE.

funny story. first time i came here, it was on the day of the folsom street fair. there were baracades and banners with hot naked gay men on them advertising sex toys and adult services (i'm guessing, but probably not too far off) and i had no idea that it was folsom street fair day that day. as we drove past all the banners and promos, my friend asked "i wonder what's going on today". my initial reaction? "it's probably farmer's market". THIS IS MY LOGIC WORKING AT ITS FINEST. that said, the line wasn't very long at around 9am sunday morning. :] Many many times i have considered driving all the way up to the city just to get the crawfish beignets and watermelon iced tea. my mind says "IT'LL BE WORTH IT" my wallet says "yo, gas just cost you $40.00 to fill up, bro". so i haven't done it yet, but those damn crawfish beignets are REALLY FRICKEN GOOD. i had all of them, but i found the chocolate one too rich and sweet and the others a little less memorable. and dude. watermelon+iced tea = GENIUS. i was first trying to conserve my intake of the iced tea because i thought "surely, something this good couldn't possibly come with refills" but HOT DIGGITY DOG. FREE REFILLS. oh wow, i love you JUST FOR THIS. major points!!! go here. it's good for you.

We were staying at the Phoenix Hotel around the corner and the desk clerk recommended the place, warning us that the wait may be long.  We lucked out, as it was late in the AM on a weekday.  I had the pumpkin pancakes - yummy, not overcooked, with candied pecans inside - wow, carb heaven.  BF declared the grits the best he's ever had.  We liked it so much we tried again on Sunday, but the line was epic.  If not for an imminent plane flight, we might have stayed.

Really solid comfort food in a very small space. The line is crazy long, but once you get inside you'll see why. Wife and I split the chocolate beignets, the croque monsieur, and a breakfast egg dish with grits. If you've never had grits (waffle house does not count), now is your chance. Love the fries, too. Thin and crispy, just the way I like them. (You might also notice Brenda in the kitchen slaving away over the griddle--love to see the owners/chefs actually cooking!) Got the Au Lait--very tasty, but really rich--I think they use cream instead of milk. This is not a complaint, it's just a warning. Afterward you should be prepared  to walk at least 3 miles so you don't die.

Well I went here twice during my recent trip over to loverly San Fran, the first time I went solo before my bf's flight came in to check it out. The concierge at my hotel said that it was in a bit of a seedy neighborhood but there was no great way to get there, so I set out to walk it. I have to say if I lived out here I would have some extremely toned legs. Anyways, the neighborhood itself I felt was not that seedy, I passed by some questionable areas on the way there but it was not far from a large courthouse. I think that if you are visiting from a smaller town then yes it would be somewhat questionable but I didn't feel unsafe at any time especially so early in the day. There a little wait out front but I opted to sit at a bar stool in the corner so I wasn't outside for more than 2 minutes. The place is tiny and they don't rush people in and out which is good and bad I suppose. I had to try the watermelon iced tea, it was alright and tasted exactly like I was eating a watermelon....if that is amazing then I suppose I was amazed, it was refreshing and there were free refills which at $2.25 there should be. I opted to just try the beignet flight and figured if I was still hungry I could try something else....it was alot of food for 8 bucks. I enjoyed the plain one, it was not as good as the one I had at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans but still solid. Then there were three filled ones...the cinnamon apple wasn't to bad but that type of filling never usually does it for me. The ghiradelli chocolate filling was so rich and oozy, I love chocolate but this was a bit much and messy...if they put less filling in it I think it would be much better. The crawfish was a nice treat since it was so different and probably my favorite, I could have done without all of the cayenne I think it was dusting the outside but you can just brush it off. Came back with my bf once he came into town and we just missed the breakfast crowd and got a table which was great since it was a rainy day. I had to get the crawfish beignets for him to try and he agreed it was pretty good, we just ate the stuffing out of them and felt the beignet to stuffing ratio could be a bit more even since there was way more beignet to stuffing. He got the molasses porkchop with sweet potato hash and biscuit, really enjoyed his dish. I got the hangtown fry and wish I could have liked it better but the combo of fried oyster and bacon in egg was to greasy and didn't agree with me. The grits were swimming in butter and pretty tasty but what isn't with a pound of butter in it, they reminded me of the cream of wheat my mom used to make me when I was little. The biscuit was also pretty good and they snidely put a little pat of butter in a dish next to the biscuit as if it needed it, the home made compote was pretty good and we opted to eat our biscuits with that instead. Both times I went I felt the service was pretty good, the waitresses were friendly enough if not a bit frazzled and busy. It is a bit pricey for french soul food but this seems to be the only place like this around so they can charge a bit more for having a lock on the market, I am happy we got a chance to come here even if I didnt like my food as much the second time around.

I work a few blocks away from Brenda's and feel blessed for the proximity. Usually on Friday mornings I'll treat myself to a delicious Brenda's breakfast. My experience with this place is that weekday mornings before 9am delivers the best food, the best service and NO wait. I usually order my breakfast to go and eat it at my desk at work, I've never had it take longer than 15 minutes to prepare at this time and the food is always perfect. Just a tip.

wow - was worth the wait. we were there for Sunday brunch favorites: watermelon iced tea, plain beignets, apple beignets, serious biscuits (specials) catfish eggs benedict, sweet potato pancakes were AMAZING i don't know what they put in that syrup but it was pure gold. I had ordered the bacon and egg tartine but it was not what i expected. The ingredients were layered separately instead of integrated together and i've never liked thick omelet style eggs but that's not Brenda's fault. Fortunately, the portions there are generous so my friends were more than happy to share. We all left feeling more than satisfied. nice, very small, casual atmosphere great service

I was impressed by the food. It was very delicious. The space is really small and intimate, so it is not ideal for large families, and everyone can hear your business. Also, they didn't want to give us boxes or at least aluminum paper for our hot partially eaten chocolate beignet. I thought that was odd. I would have liked as least aluminum paper, because fried chocolate in a white bag = greasy mess.

I'm going back. This was hella busy at lunch. What a great neighborhood to have to wait outside on the curb for a table! We got a flight of the beignets but wish we had a flight of only crayfish beignets, very delicious. Service was good, friendly and fast enough. Also, the pulled port/sweet potato hash special was great especially when you make a perfect bite with the eggs (in this case, over easy) in the mix. The scrimp and grits special was OK I guess. Scrimp to grits proportion needed a little help. More shrimp, please.

no doubt about the long wait. it's a really small cutsie place. Ordered the flight beignets, shrimp & grits, watermelon ice tea. friends ordered the oyster omelet and the jambalaya. Crawfish beignet was the highlight. I'd recommend just getting the crawfish instead of the flight. Shrimp and grits was on the heavy side and a lil too salty for my taste. The waitress recommended their popular biscuit to go with it. Biscuit was bomb! watermelon ice tea was refreshing. free refills. but not a must-try. Oyster omelet was delicious. It comes with the cheddar grits and biscuit, so this is actually a better pick than the shrimp & grits since it has everything except the shrimp. Jambalaya was also really good. Also on the heavy side. We all had leftovers even though we've been starved waiting in line. Try the jam on the table! Overall, heavy breakfast but good. Would come back to try their shrimp po boy just cause many people there ordered it.

5 stars - customer service.  I particularly liked Andrew, the matradee.  He was approachable, knowledgable, and considerate 3 stars - ambience.  Very little seating, long wait, and it was loud.  It was around lunch time on Saturday. 5 stars - food.  Very interesting selection which will make me go back.  My eyes drooled at everyone else's dishes, but since I was alone, I just got the shrimp po' boy (as recommended by 7x7 BIG EATS).  The shrimp was fresh and delicate with just the right amount of frying.  The bread was tasty, mainly because it was toasted and quite buttered. 4 stars - price.  $10 for a shrimp sandwich (without tip?).  HM.  It was good shrimp, but it does seem a bit like Fisherman Wharf pricing.

I'd been wanting to go to Brenda's for a while and was super excited when my two friends decided to meet there this weekend. The wait was over an hour, which I expected since I have driven past the place multiple times on weekend morning and have always seen the giant crowd waiting outside. The food was delicious.  I ordered the Hangtown Fry and the Beignet flight.  Having tried all the beignets, I would recommend ordering the plain or the crawfish.  i was not too impressed with the chocolate or the apple ones.  The hangtown fry was delicious with its oysters, scallops, and bacon.  It came with most delicious biscuit and grits or potatoes.   My only complaint would (the -1 star) be the service.  One of our waitresses was pretty rude, and the only showed up to take our order, give us our food, and to give our check.  There was no service provided in between.

The pros: *The food was awesome. The cons: *Our Server was unfriendly, unhelpful, and inaccurate *The wait was 2 hours. My verdict: There are just too many fantastic restaurants with great food in this city that have much better service and a much better wait time for me to venture to Brenda's again.   However, if you are really craving some creole cooking...  you should try this place.  A little advice though, make sure to do it on a weekday!

Brenda's is much better than they were three years ago--I've been going again recently, and their crawfish and plain beignets are AMAZING. (And, yes, piping hot inside.)

So, yes, here's your fourth star, Brenda's; you've earned it.

Never have been disappointed, although I did once make the mistake of showing up during peak hours and waited 35 minutes for a table. So far I have not been to a restaurant that was worth waiting over 15 minutes to get into more than maybe once a year (Dotties). The food is always delightful. Lots of deep fried this and gravy on that, but never a lack of restraint. I've had the creole vegetable omelet, the grillades(beef cutlets in gravy with eggs and grits!), the burger, the gumbo, and the beignets. All are awesome, but it is brendas fried chicken (BFC) that has made an impression compelling enough to write this review. I've had it twice, once there, once togo. Both times the breading was crispy and seasoned, and adhered to the chicken which is juicy and delicious. For about $13 i get 3 pieces, a killer biscuit, french fries and cole slaw. Sublime. My words do it no justice.

The food was well planned and presented. Tasty but not phenomenal to warrant the long lines that occur. Very crowded and tight fit in the restaurant. I felt like a sardine.

I have never had a bad experience at Brenda's.  Everything on the menu (including the specials and their new dinner menu) is fantastic.  My personal favorite is the pumpkin pie pancakes with vanilla cream cheese.  If they had it on the menu year-round I'd never order anything else! Their grillades and grits is a good suggestion for a first timer, especially for that amazing biscuit.  I should also mention they have great coffee and the watermelon iced tea is very tasty. My only warning is don't go here if you're on a diet!

My favs are apple and traditional.  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY.  The guy next to me ordered some pancakes, and I almost whipped one right off of his place.    This place is definitely reminding me of New Orleans cuisine!!!

I was slightly over-hyped due to all of the glowing reviews. I'm torn, but I'll rate a star up because I arrived later in the day on a Saturday.  Anyone who's worked in the industry knows what the end of a shift feels like. Not to say anything in particular was wrong at all.  It was actually quite a good meal.  Just not exceptional. Service all the way through was warm, personal, and attentive.  This is important especially with how tiny the place is.   The beignets were a little heavy, but really good. Had the crawfish ones and the plain ones. Crawfish takes first. Oyster and bacon scramble was on the table. Corn beef hash was too. A veggie omlette. Biscuits. Grits. Watermelon tea. Some Andouille sausage. Beignets?  Yes. Grits?  mmm grits n butta! Biscuits?  CRACKIN! Watermelon tea?  Perfectly refreshing with just the right amount of sweet. Andouille?  I expected homemade.  Maybe they were.  Definitely didn't taste like it.  Tasted like spicy bologna. The only semblance of French meeting New Orleans here for me was assorted liberal sprinklings of Cajun spice. Other than that, it was just a GOOD breakfast, with a few BAM!s thrown in. I'll be back though, the beignets and biscuits alone are worth it.

I had to try this place after all the good reviews on yelp. It seems like that's the same idea everyone got. When we got there the place was full not a big surprise since the tiny place only seems to seat 20 at most. Cramped, crowded and loud but the food is pretty damn good. My husband thought he was being smart by dropping me off at the restaurant first so I could get us a table. No such luck. They won't seat you until everyone in your party is there. So I watched as others who got there after me got seated. Trying not to be impatient waiting for my husband I focused on the menu. I'm not big into eggs nor am I big into breakfast things. But everything on the menu looked pretty yummie. After we got seated we ordered the beignet flight and monsieur gruyere. The beignet flight is great if you are really into sweets. It came with a plain, chocolate, apple and crawfish w/ green onion and cheese beignet. They were all very good. I don't know why this always happens but every time we go out I end up liking what my husband ordered 99% more! His monsieur gruyere sandwich with ham, gruyere cheese and delicious sour dough bread toasted or fried tasted SO good! It was so crispy and tasty. So I had to bargain with him and offer him half of my beignet flight for half of his sandwich. We both also got the watermelon ice tea which was sweet made with fresh watermelon. One of the waitresses couldn't add and undercharged us by $10. We had to be honest and told them. When we left, the outside was filled with people waiting to try this french soul food. Definitely a great place to try. I don't know if I have the patience to wait for a table next time though. So get there early.

i have to give it 4 stars for the biscuits alone.  i love biscuits.  biscuits are the benchmark for which to judge the southern food.   the grits, while delicious, were a bit buttery for my taste.  but that's just my cholesterol talking. the beignets (plain) were a delightful "appetizer" if you will.  great dipped in the coffee.   the sweet potato pancakes were amazing - but i advise splitting them - between about 4 people.  they are very rich and the portion size is huge. and finally, while i have a hard time paying $9 for eggs, grits and biscuits (something that would cost a fraction of that in the south), i have to give it props for providing me some southern cooking - my love - and a rare treat here on the west coast.

OK - first of all, if you're watching what you eat -- carbs, fat, etc,... then don't even bother on coming here!  This is a place to enjoy your food w/o any guilt!  It is definitely comfort food at it's best!   Went yesterday, got there about 1215 and yep, there was a line outside.  Thank goodness the weather was gorgeous.  There were about 10 names before mine and the wait was about 20-25 minutes...  There were two of us and we had already checked out the menu and the specials and had no idea what we were in for...  We watched as the tables next to us got their orders and all we could hear were a bunch of "mmm's" and "oh my gawds..."  Everything around us looked sooo good!!!   We decided to share a few things... 1) Flight of Beignets -- a must, especially if you can't decide which flavors to try.  This one comes with all -- plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish.  The crawfish one was SCRUMPTIOUS!  The plain was good and the chocolate one was good too, though like what someone else said, there is  A LOT of chocolate, so it's good for a choco-holic.  We obviously couldn't finish them all, so I will be tasting the apple one soon (packed it as a snack for today!) 2) Watermelon Tea -- it was okay.  To me, it tasted like water-downed watermelon juice.  I drank it all (plus some of the refill), but my friend asked to take it back and ordered something else to drink.  I don't think I would order it next time. 3) Sweet Potato pancakes -- OK, my friend tried it first and the look on her face was HILARIOUS!  It's like she had gone to heaven or something.  She closed her eyes and was savoring the crispy edge of the very thick pancake (there were 2), and the syrup with pecans went very well with it. 4) To offset the sweet, we both ordered the Shrimp & Grits.  We both have NEVER had anything like this before.  I mean, we had grits with cheese, but this was like it had a scoop of gumbo on it and the melted cheese with that sauce and BACON RELISH.... OMG!!!!!  We both just had to look at each other.  We couldn't even talk, it left us both speechless but with a big ole smile on our faces.   It was definitely  a big serving and we should have shared that too.  Definitely a heavy, heavy meal but OH SO DEEEELISH!!!!!!!   Just had the leftovers for lunch :) Our bill came out to $50...  I will be back!!

I picked this place out because they had beignets - sadly, they are not good beignets. They are large, greasy and not at all puffy. I think the waiter was offended that I didn't finish them, but oh well. However, the special fried catfish Benedict with spicy hollandaise was wonderful. An unusual and delicious combination. And they cooked the eggs, poached, correctly, which is so uncommon these days. The wait was silly - probably 45 minutes to be squeezed onto a bar seat and have to stare at myself in a mirror. Whoever thought putting a huge mirror up for the people are the bar to stare at was either very vain or has a bad sense of humor. My waiter was somewhat indifferent, but the women who brought coffee was attentive and helpful. The stars are for the special, and the lack of stars for the beignets and the atmosphere.

This is my first foray into beignets.  I really wished that it wasn't though.  Paola and I had a flight of beignets (we tried them all).  It's really a lot for two peeps.  Crawfish, chocolate, plain, apple-cinnamon.  On top of that we both had our own plates of food: Croque Monsieur and the Bacon Tartine. Croque is basically a very good, gormet grilled cheese (highly recommend this), and the Bacon Tartine is a scramble with a slice of french bread underneath (this was great too) and a side of grits (very thick).  Both plates were around $10-$12.  Check out their website too! Obviously, if you're reading this blog, there's a chance you might go and try this...my advice is to get there early, before 10:30am to grab a sit within 30-40 mins.  BUT, while you wait, grab a vietnamese coffee around the corner at Lee's sandwich or a late lunch at Saigon Sandwiches..both of which are very close to each other on Larkin. It's small place, very intimate, and I heard the restroom is rather small too, which is directly through the small kitchen (love those work spaces!).  Lastly, they did have tables big enough for 4 tops, but chances of a 2 top opening up is greater...i.e. don't come here with many peeps. Eat here, please!

Went there Saturday, 5/2.  Got there at 11am.  There was a crowd waiting to be seated.  Put our name down for 2 and finally got seated in 45 minutes. Got the Flight of Beignets: it's a combination of all 4 that they have, plain, chocolate, apple and crawfish.  This was my first taste of beignets and they were all pretty good but the apple and the crawfish were better tasting out of the 4. I got the french toast with the butter pecan sauce.  Very good and they give you 6 half slices. My friend got the andouille and cheddar omelette.  Tried the potatoes and they were pretty good.  I didn't try anything else on her plate. We ended taking the half of our plates home. Parking is hard.  There's street parking with meters.  It's a quarter for 6 minutes. Place inside is small.  It only seats 40 people.  Good for 1 to 4 people but anymore than that, it's not good. If I'm in the city again, I might go back.

i have ordered a couple of omelette dishes with sides of grits and biscuits, and shared beignets with a friend the two times i have been here.  i am unfamiliar with southern cooking, but this place made me a fan... especially became a fan of grits.   the beignets are a must-try but BEWARE!  they are more than you can handle.  i thought i was gonna die trying to finish the flight of beignets shared with a friend... on another occasion i shared ONE beignet with a friend and couldn't even finish that.  if you get the beignets don't bother ordering anything else... you won't be able to eat it all.   tiny space and the wait is long if you get there after 9 or 9:30.  the longest i've waited was at most 40 minutes because i was there around 9am.  and not good for big groups.  and... as much as i like this place, the food is really heavy so it's not likely that i will go here frequently.  but it's a must try for breakfast/brunch food in the city, because it's different from the typical breakfast/brunch place - has a twist of southern style.

Starting brunch out with beignets was smart - warm sweet bread wrapped around cinnamony apple pieces...deeelish. And they give you 3 per order! Next time I'm trying the chocolate. My friend and I split the fried shrimp po'boy - which was pulled together nicely with the chipotle dressing. We also split the egg and bacon tartine - a yummy choice but I think the po'boy was better. However, the grits that came with the tartine were the best I've ever had! Too much food for us both to finish, but we both left full and happy.

came back today. Originally I wanted to eat at Dotties but the line was so long, I decided to come to Brenda's and waited for about 20 minutes for a table. I'm so GLAD I came to Brenda's! My shrimp and grits were fantastic! and so were the crawfish beignets! My boyfriend loved his andouille chedder omelet, but he's not a fan of grits so he didn't like my dish all that much. Anyway, I was so stuffed and so happy! Can't wait to come back for more =)

probably top 5 breakfast spots for me all time.. they have lonnnnnng waits which usually means high expectations. but brendas delivers on the regular. located in the 'loin you wouldnt expect much but once you step in you feel very warm. they have a beautiful mural on one wall and a mirror covering the entire opposite wall. They have an amazing granola pancake, and their beignets are very good. Chickory coffee. is super too as well as the gumbo and its all reasonably priced with really friendly service.

During our SF trip this fall, we had an incredible meal here. Probably the most memorable of our entire trip. We knew we'd have to wait when we got there. So we signed in and waited, looking in at the diners and what they were eating. We decided very quickly what we were ordering just by looking at the specials board outside. After 15 minutes, we were sat in the tiny dining room. Ordered coffee, begniets, bananas foster French toast, and the winner, shrimp and grits!! Wow! It was truly a party in our mouths. The coffee was rich. The begniets were flavorful. The shrimp and grits... Omg.   The next day we were heading up to sonoma. But we thought long and hard about skipping that and just going back to brenda's. Good thing it was Tuesday and she was closed. We cannot wait to eat here again. I can't understand why there are so many locals that haven't been here. If you've thought about it, stop thinking and just do it.

Breakfast with great friends @ brenda's! We went on a weekday which made it easier to get a table. Place is tiny!! One friend had po boy sandwich which she loved..another friend ordered the beignets flight n got to try all the flavors... She loved the crawfish one & chocolate... N also raved about the watermelon iced tea..the omelette was good but my friend loved the grits! The only thing that sucks is that you have to go through the kitchen to use the bathroom & one of the waitress yelled at me n my friend for attempting to use it without letting her know.. Screw her!  Haha

The best brunch I have ever had in my life. I had their sweet potato pancakes - the ultimate example of what all pancakes should be. It was dense and moist and fluffy all at the same time. And to top it off, there was a delicious butter pecan sauce that complements the pancakes perfectly. The crawfish beignets are also delicious. For four people, we ordered the sampler, and I have to say that only the crawfish ones were really good. Prices are super reasonable. Came at lunchtime on a rainy weekday so there was no wait :) But I know on weekends the waits can be hectic.

My actual score is 4.75999992 stars.  Southern brunch spots seem to be the craze right about now and Brenda's makes one of the best ones out there.  I had the Shrimp and Grits which came with a bacon/tomato relish that took this dish to heights that even Oakland's "Brown Sugar Cafe" has never seen.  My sister in law had the oyster scramble which was even better than my dish.  The watermelon iced tea was also a perfect compliment to a sunny saturday in the bay.

Got here at 8:15am on Saturday (Memorial Day weekend) with my hubby and good friend to beat the lines.  We had to scour around for parking a few blocks away because the meter is good for only 1 hour. Surprisingly there was a table open!  Ordered 1) watermelon iced tea - love it & get refills too! 2) sweet potato pancakes with ginger pecan sauce - had a zing to it & very hearty. You get 2 & they are huge & about 1/4" thick! You can see the bits of sweet potatoes. 3) sampler beignets - dense & a bit overfried.  I was hoping they would be light & fluffy like Just Yours. 4) Gulf Shrimp & Goat Cheese Omelette: yummy to the tummy. The shrimp tasted fresh & the omelette was shaped like a hot pocket. Came with side pototatoes which were   5)

I love this place. My stomach is a bottomless pit whenever I come here. I never really say that eating food is orgasmic, but eating food here definitely is. Eating just one entree isn't enough for me, I always end up eating half of somebody else's dish too. It just happens! You must try these three dishes if you're a newbie...(1) French Toast with Pecan Sauce (2) Catfish Po'boy w/ Fries and (3) Egg and Bacon Tartine Sandwich. This place is always packed since it's a little hole in the wall. So come early or come late!

Close to a 4 star but the gumbo was really only so so...lots of items aren't really soul food....long wait and prices are reasonable to expensive.

Ohhhh how I love thee and your small tiny space and all the flavors that beignets come in. You never seem to disappoint me. I've mastered you and your waiting time. Avoid weekends and come during the weekdays for lunch after 1pm. 15 mins is the max for wait time. The first time I came, I brought champagne because a fellow yelper had mentioned BYOB. I asked and our waitress said no. So I took the champagne sent from France to Tahoe. It went towards something memorable and I didn't held it against you. Your soul food was soooo good that I came back for red beans and rice with sausage (perfectly flavored), your gumbo, your fried oysters, your shrimp and grits. None disappointed me. In fact, I stuffed myself with your beignet flight. Ohhh, how I love thee.

I didn't love it.  Upon the waitress's recommendation, I went Shrimp and Grits.  "People get really mad when they aren't on the menu."  Why?  They were drenched in too much sauce, and I can't believe I'm complaining about being over-cheesed, but they were also waaaay over-cheesed.  I'm no soul food expert, but I like to, uhm, taste my grits when I get grits.  The coffee was bad.  The orange juice was bad.  No champagne for a breakfast cocktail.  Bright spot:  the Peach Cobbler pancakes.

Slightly heavy and most definitely buttery, but soul food at its best. Well done, Brenda! The watermelon sweet tea is a must-have as well. For the quality and quantity of food, it is very reasonably priced as well.

We enjoyed the food here.  We started out with the sweet watermelon tea.   I enjoy the refreshing taste of watermelon drinks.  We ordered the gumbo, house salad, fried oyster po-boy w/ FF, and beignets.  The gumbo was good, but I prefer it with lots of seafood, such as crawfish, shrimp, scallops, crabs, etc.  The house salad is tasty, and even better with fried oysters on top.  The oyster po-boy was good.  The best part of the meal was the beignet sampler!  The biggest surprise was the granny smith beignet which was delicious.  I didn't think I would like it as much as the chocolate and crayfish beignet, but I did!  The beignets here are denser than the ones I usually have, but delicious nonetheless.  I love the beignets at cafe du monde and Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen.  This place is worth a try if you enjoy Creole/Cajun cuisine.

Really good NoLa style breakfast offerings.  I had the grillades and grits - which is kinda like a New Orleans style beef tips in gravy.  It's a very local offering that isn't even made in other parts of Louisiana.  Theirs was a lot of food and had a good flavor.  The grits were creamy and I could have eaten about twice as many of them - even though I was stuffed.  We also got the crawfish begniet - a New Orleanian would liken it to crawfish bread from the Jazz Fest - and were very pleased with the rich, cheesy filling.  Go early or you will be waiting in line with the rest of the hipsters.  Next I am going to try the catfish po' boy or the catfish benedict.  They even serve Community Coffee - at least they had the cans on display.  Laissez les bon temps rouller!

It was a long long wait in the middle of the tenderloin but well worth it. I had some sort of scramble I think it was, and we ordered the apple beignets (i think?) to try and ended up getting a crayfish one accidentally thrown in there. I was grossed out by the thought of it so I didnt order it, but Im so glad it got mistakenly put in our plate because it was DELICIOUS!!!! The jam that comes on the side for your biscuit is ssooo good too. I think its peach? I think I need to return here for a refresher. All I remember is yummy spicy and savory breakfast goodness and walking out with a food coma.

We started off with the free refills watermelon sweet tea, crawfish beignets (my favorites), and a bowl of the delicious gumbo.   We had the granny smith apple beignets which were good, but still crawfish with the cheesiness and spices.. so yum. I had the shrimp and grits for the first time and it was soooo very good.  I could hardly finish.   My sister had the oyster po'boy which was good, loved the coleslaw and my friends had the grillates & grits and the fried mixed basket.   love their watermelon pickles.  really like the new space, higher ceiling, looked like fancier bathroom w/o having to scoot pass the cooks and waitstaff like before.   Anyways....  will be coming back.  We also heard the waitstaff mention they might start opening for dinner.... hmmmmmmmmm happy.

been wanting to come here ever since wakako u. brought home one of their crawfish beignets a few months ago, but as i am trying to drop 20 pounds i didn't dare step foot in this place.  but with memories of that beignet and with my  friend brenda suggesting brunch at brenda's, my rubber arm was as good as twisted. this is what we had: crawfish beignet- not as good as i remember, could have used more crawfish and less dough. still outstanding, though. shrimp po'boy- perfectly seasoned, succulent shrimp; side fries perfect. fried chicken- pure crack. biscuits n' sausage gravy- heavenly, buttery goodness topped with savory chunks of sausage in lush, decadent gravy. oh, and since we arrived 5 minutes before closing, there was no line. score!

I would come back just for the oysters and biscuits with Jam. If its your fist time try the oyster flight and get a sampling of all the flavors. def get a side order biscuit with your meal! The shrimp and grits was a bit too cheesy and rich for me. Lots of cheese on it! Fried chicken was very good and moist, but nothing insanely amazing. Should have checked the board for specials of the day. We didn't even realize there was a chalk board when you walk in against the wall. Make sure you check it out cause the specials looked good. oh yeah, watermelon tea is good, just make sure they strain some ah that pulp out. mine had chunks galore, which made it a bit hard to drink

I was a little disappointed with Brenda's because i thought the food was going to excellent. I tried the watermelon tea but it tasted horrible. I just opted for the coffee instead.  I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine which was good but my potatoes has was way too salty.  Also located in the Terderlion, i doubt i was visit again since i saw 2 homeless guys sleeping right next to the restaurant.  Overall, Brenda's food was okay but nothing too special for me.

yum. we went today for brunch, their first sunday open ever.  lucky, as we didn't bother checking that they usually didn't open sundays. short wait. but totally, totally worth it. the place is totally tiny so there is definitely waiting involved. they have a great simple menu for brunch. everything looked fantastic. i had severe food envy looking around. we had the cinammon apple beignets. they were ok -- i still vote for the ones at boulette's at the ferry building. these were just too large, not quite light fluffy enough. we each had an omelette with a cream biscuit and grits. the biscuit and grits were fanTAStic. the biscuit was really fabulous, the grits were creamy. the omelette was the perfect size and texture - fluffy with structure. even the coffee was nice and rich. great service too.

Seems like the only way you can get a quick seat is before 11:30 on a random weekday.  And luckily that's what me and my friends were able to do today.   The six of us started off with the beignet flight.  I'm glad I tried them all, but the Crawfish beignet was by far my favorite and when I go back I will make sure to get an order for myself so I can just stick my face in it and not have to share w/ anyone.  Others at the table who prefer things a little sweeter really enjoyed the chocolate beignets. The biscuits were a perfect ratio of buttery goodness to crispy edges.  They are good on their own, dipped in the grits or shmeared with Brenda's homemade jam.  Definitely coming back to explore the other great things on their menu.

I haven't had grillades and grits since I was a teen. I might be rating on sentiment, but it was good stuff. They also served Community coffee... more childhood memories.

One of the best, most flavorful and lovingly cooked breakfasts of my life (beside that ones I make for myself;)) The interior design is a nice mixture of contemporary minimalism, earthy colors and traditional objects. Only one "warning": get the grits only if you really love melted butter, which I do not.

Brenda's is so good that you'll forget that you're in the Tenderloin and a few doors down from a KFC. We've been lucky enough to sample a lot on the menu with groups of friends and everything has been consistently great.  The biscuits and grits are excellent, and I never thought I would like grits until I had Brenda's version.  The po boy, various egg dishes, gumbo, ... are all yummy.  The only thing I remember someone not liking was a drink (some kind of juice I think). The beignets are also good, but I must be missing something because they don't excite me the way they seem to excite a lot of other diners. Try going during off-peak hours (early for lunch or late) to avoid the long line and shady Polk street corner.

As a lot of my fellow Yelpers suggest, this place is delicious and a treat  - though you may wait as the restaurant is small.  Watermelon iced tea, grits, and the Vegan Josephine are some of my favorite items on the menu.  If you have not tried Brenda's, I highly suggest you do so.

I did not have a good experience with the service here. I came for lunch and since the place was packed, I decided to order take out instead of waiting. The girl at the counter didn't seem to want to help me. I asked her if I could order take out and she said sure, in a few minutes. When I asked her, she was just standing there and wasn't doing anything. But I guess my request prompted her to do all the things on her "to do " list before assisting me. She proceeded to run some plates, fill glasses with water, bring checks to tables, take orders--all BEFORE taking my order. The *nice* thing to do would have been to take my order first so that the kitchen could get started and minimize my wait time, plus I wouldn't feel so awkward just standing there in the cramped restaurant just staring at people eating...I waited a full 45 minutes after she took my order. I left the restaurant pissed off and swore that I would not come back, no matter how good the food was. Until... I took a bite into my fried oyster po'boy. OMG. I didn't expect too much from the sandwich because it was to-go and by the time I sat down at the office, it was no longer hot. It more than met my expectations and exceeded it by far. The sandwich was delish! Love the spicy dressing and the slaw was the best slaw I've ever had. I savored every bite. The food really speaks for itself here. They could definitely improve on service. I can't wait to come back to give it another shot. Maybe next time it'll be 5-stars. It has the potential.

On last Thursday and I tried their lunch the first time.  Its a small place so you will expect a little wait even during weekdays.  We got there around 1230 and we got our table around 1245.  Luckily there was only one table waiting before us.  So me and my friend decided to share everything.  We had  the Beignets flight which includes plain, chocolate, apple and crawfish.  The crawfish was our favorite.  It's cheesy and taste.  The chocolate has a strange flavor, and we both didn't really dig it.  Then we shared a cup of Gumbo and a BBQ pork sandwiches(I dont remember the name but it mixed with BBQ sauce).  The Gumbo is really good; its thick and mix with a smoky flavor.  The last but not the least is the BBQ sandwich.  You should get few more napkins ready because its so juicy and once you bit on it the sauce will just dripping everywhere.  Watermelon tea is average.  But overall its a good place to have brunch or lunch.

I've driven past this place many times but always early before it's open. I had no idea. Then I read about it on Yelp. Been here twice and really love it. My son & I couldn't wait to have the crawfish beignets again. This morning I had the grillades & grits, which was delicious. My son had the eggs benedict & thought the biscuit overwhelmed the eggs, ham & sauce, because it was so thick. Maybe a layer of sauce before laying on the eggs & ham would moisten it some-and make it richer. Look forward to returning. Thanks yelp!

Terrible, uptight, and super-rude service. Beignets were fine. I also ordered house-made granola, which doesn't come with anything. Just dry (and average) granola in a bowl. So you can buy a glass of milk (there's no soy) or you can order some yogurt parfait. Ugh.

Brenda's is a (not-so) hidden gem in the TL.  The hoards of people hovering outside Polk/Eddy on the weekends will lead you to the right locale (no, they are not waiting outside Ken-taco). In all seriousness, best to get to Brenda's by 9:30a or you will be waiting more than an hour outside as this place is as big as a walk-in closet. There are very few seats, and the seats are cramped, but they sure do make up for it in taste. Must dos: The Beignet flight, but be forewarned it can be very filling even before you get your main dish. The potato hash is delicious and the biscuits are the biggest I've seen since my days living in the South. Cannot wait to sample off the lunch menu and breakfast again sometime SOON!

Oyster omelette!!! I love you, oyster omelette. They were the fattest, plumpest, pearliest oysters.  Parking might be hard to find, but if you go at 7:30 am, the meters don't start until 8. The waitress was nice, but she messed up my order. I felt a bit rushed, but I understand why. The place is tiny tiny tiny and super cute. I want to go back and try the watermelon tea. I asked her what she recommends and she kind of just motioned toward the specials that are written with dry erase marker on the mirror. Nice touch. I wish she recommended the beignets because I've never tried them and they seem like hitters according to other reviews. I will be going back because everything looks good and i want to try EVERYTHING.

I was a bit let-down by my experience at Brenda's.  I went for brunch on a week day.  I had the beignet flight and didn't really care for any of them.  I love crawfish, so I was really looking forward to the crawfish beignet.  Unfortunately it tasted kinda fishy and there wasn't much filling in it.  The chocolate one was no better.  There was pure melted chocolate in the middle, when I was expecting something more like pudding or something not so darn heavy.  The apple one was blah, and I still can't figure out why anyone would order the plain ones.  The coffee was good, and the OJ did not seem to be fresh-squeezed, which was another let-down.  I tried my friend's biscuit, and it was the best thing I had.  Everything else on the menu was standard stuff...omelets etc.  I could go to Bashful Bull and get the same food without the line.  Don't think I'll be going back.

I adore Brenda's!  True, the wait is long but totally worth it.   I had the most amazing peach cobbler pancakes here once which I think I have been dreaming about for the last two years.  The fried oyster po' boy is probably my favorite. The andouille omelet is also a solid choice and I love that they brew up a great cup of authentic Louisiana coffee.   If getting in here didn't have to always be such an ordeal, I would probably be their best customer.  I think it is for the best though, I have to say that after eating here I usually feel like I may have to be rolled out the door. This is definitely a place where a foodie can get a little carried away!

Don't be turned off by the wait and be mindful of the sign-in sheet.. the place is small but they're quick...if you miss your turn because you walked off to get coffee when they called you - go ahead and add your name back to the bottom of the list and wait your turn again...

They don't have a lot of seating ,so hence there are really long waits to get a table.  The food is pretty good, for the soul food lover. Their famous beignets are usually the starts for most folks and they have sweet ones (apple, chocolate) and savory (spicy crawfish), along with a plain one. We shared a plate of the beignet sampler among multiple people, so I only had a small taste of  them.  I liked the grits and biscuits here, both quite delicious and well made.  I just don't know if i would go through a wait just to eat here.  It has an interesting ambiance, being in the loin and being a cozy spot but for my money,  I'd rather go to a larger space where i can get seated within 15 min vs waiting on the street.

this is one of those places where it all depends on what you order... i got the shrimp and grits... mmm... mouth is watering just thinking about it.... definitely one of the best shrimp and grits experiences i have ever had (however, i am from LA so im no grits expert)... all i know for sure was that i loved the amount of shrimp, the texture, and the hint of spiciness.... We ordered the beignet flight... and (at least in this instance) they were too dry and crunchy for my taste... the crawfish were the best of the bunch and if/when i go back i will probably just order those... the other people in my party seemed content with their food... their dishes seemed solid but not special... i definitely want to go back to have the catfish eggs benedict so hopefully that will live up to the shrimp & grits! overall i was very happy but i dont think its worth waiting an hour+ to be be seated...

My friend and I had the catfish eggs Benedict, which was delicious. The service was also friendly, and the dishes have huge portions for a reasonable price.

Yumm!  The food is absolutely delicious!  I've come several times, ordered a variety of items, and it has been consistently awesome every single time.  The service is decent.  The wait staff is quick and to the point, but they dont make you feel rushed to decide and eat.  Yes, the waitlist can seem long, but it actually goes fairly quickly.  The organization of this restaurant is surprisingly fluid for such a tiny establishment.  The wait is not nearly as horrible as what you will find at Brown Sugar Kitchen.   Some of the amazing items that I've ordered or sampled are: -Fried Shrimp Po-Boy  - pretty good, but I'm not big on sandwiches; -Sweet Watermelon Tea - oh so delicious, and free refills! -Beignet Flight - fried awesomeness, my personal fav is the crawfish; -Grillades and Grits - by far the best dish, grillades are super tasty, grits are made in the perfect consistency, the texture of the grits dont get lost in the butter and cheesy goodness. -Shrimp and Grits - shrimp are juicy, plump and tender, grits are delicious. -Biscuits - I love.  They taste just as amazing as leftovers as they did when they're first served.  How this is even possible, I have no idea. I wish I lived closer so I could come more often!

Brenda's is now right next door in a longer but narrow restaurant space to accomodate more people but the amount of servers hasn't changed so it takes awhile to get your food. My fave dish of grits and grillades was lackluster this time. The meat was tough, before it melted in your mouth and the sauce was delish...the biscuit was clumpy and shaped like a preschoolers clay creation...the grits were still good but the watermelon tea tasted meh as well.

THE WAIT: We came on a weekday so the wait was not that bad.  We waited about 20 minutes on a weekday around noon.   OUR FOOD: We ordered the beignet flight, shrimp po boy, and a bacon and egg tartine MY TAKE: The beignet flight is THE dish to get here.  With that said, I was pretty underwhelmed.  I thought the beignets were really doughy.  I was really expecting them to be lighter and have a better filling/dough distribution.   I'd probably get flamed by the snobs for saying this, but I actually liked the beignets at Disneyland more than the ones here.   The shrimp po boy was good, but I was hoping to get a little more shrimp.  The chipotle remoulade was the highlight of the sandwich. THE CONCLUSION: The place is tiny and stuffy and the food is just ok.  Not a fan.

So I'm a little reluctant to write this review.  Not because the food wasn't friggin amazing (which it was) but because there is a small part of me that doesn't want to word to get out about this  little jewel. I don't even know where to begin.  The dinner menu was like a smorgesborg of fried deliciousness.  I started with the crawfish beinget and to say that it was a great way to start a meal is putting it mildly.  This was like a creamy explosion of crawfish and paprika...oh so good! The fried basket was...well...just that.  An assortment of fried shellfish catfish with a few hushpuppies to boot made this an experience that I soon won't forget. But the main event surprisingly came from a side dish.  the Mac n' cheese was unlike anything I've ever had.  Maybe it's because the restaurant is in the Tenderloin and they put a little bit of crack in it...I don't know.  All I do know is that I couldn't stop eating it. So going back to my original point about not wanting to get the word out about this place.  Right now, I could walk in at 7:00 on a friday night and get a table without any trouble.  The problem is that if their dinner service becomes as good as their brunch service, I've got a long wait ahead of me on the street watching all the fun entertainment the tenderloin has to offer. So the bottom line here is definitely check this place out for dinner, so long as you're not in line ahead of me :)

Any place that offers a beignet flight is A OK in my book, my favorite was the crawfish and cayenne, with the traditional powdered sugar variety coming in a close second. The Hangtown Fry was a massive plate of fried goodness (oysters and bacon) hidden inside an omelette with a side of crispy potatoes and a king-sized biscuit. I recommend splitting entrees unless you're starving or carry your own defibrillator. The only thing missing was a Bloody Mary, but then again a liquor license would probably only increase the wait.

On a windy Saturday morning, a few of my friends and I headed up towards Brenda's from Civic Center. I love the gritty walk through the Tenderloin although I would have definitely missed a place like Brenda's trying to avoid the various spitballs and vomit stains on the sidewalk. It's not too hard to miss, usually there are small groups huddling around waiting their turn at the delicious soul food. The four of us ordered the sampler beignets and my friend had the ingenious idea of putting one beignet on each plate and just rotating it around so that we could sample each one --a nibble of the crawfish, a bite of the traditional plain, a spoonful of the molten chocolate, and my personal favorite, a generous helping of the spiced apple. Food was good, not amazing, but I wasn't disappointed with the portion size or the price. The ambiance could have been a little more cozy. I felt like the four of us were crammed in like sardines having to talk over one another in order to have a decent conversation. I recommend going to Brenda's with the mentality of "shut up, eat now, talk later." It's not a place to have a leisurely brunch since there are very few tables and the counter space is hardly a place to have a decent meal. Food is decent and a little classier than your local diner joint, but the ambiance  is definitely not for people who can't stand...well, er, other people. Brenda's could use more space, but if diners are wiling to wait, this soul food will continue to please more and more Yelpers. On the Menu - Sorry, can't remember exact names Sampler Plate of Beignets Watermelon Iced Tea (highly recommended) Creole Veggie Omelette with Grits A cup of Gumbo Po' Boy Sandwich Some kind of beef stew with eggs, grits, and toast

Been there twice for lunch.  It's very small, and you end up either sharing a table or sitting at the very small "counter" in the back of the place if you don't get there very early for lunch.  Being 6'3" and 225, it's not very comfortable, but I'm here for the food, and it's damn good.  It really does remind me of N'awlins:  Po Boys, beignets, and croque monsiour, and all very tasty.  Service can be a little slow, but not awful.  My only other objection is that it can get pretty warm and stuffy in there, even with my suit jacket off.  Of course, I put up with it all because it really is a treat to eat here!

OMG......it's so worth the wait-about 45 minutes.  Everything we tried was good.  Crawfish Beignet, Gumbo, Grilades & Grits, French Toast with Walnut syrup, Watermelon ice tea.  Efficient & friendly service.  Only gripe is that the food is not steaming hot when it come out......especially the coffee.   The bill came to $40.00 including tips. Will definitely go back and try other things on the menu......still feeling the warmth from my tummy full of Brenda's yummy treat after 6 hrs........

Great breakfast, especially after a late night out. Be prepared to wait in line or get there early. I love the Beignets especially the Crawfish and the Chocolate. The prices are reasonable too, as long as you don't go crazy and order too much food as I always seem to do. I love to go to Brenda's for breakfast then make my way up Polk to Leland Tea and just relax and sip tea, and work or read all day. It is my idea of a perfect day! Its so relaxing. These are jewels of the Polk St. area.

The best food for a law school girl in the middle of her first final exams. Comfort food to numb the pain and I somehow managed to study for 6 hours after eating without falling into a food coma (probably because I was too full to fall asleep). We ordered one of almost everything between the two of us. Had the Oysters and Egg, Grits, Beignet sampler, biscuit, Hash and the cafe au lait. Loved it all for being warm and fuzzy like a favorite hoodie. Will have to return during normal life and outside of the finals bubble to see if it is as enjoyable.

My "anything but the book" club met here on a Saturday for brunch. The place was crazy packed, the crowd outside waiting was nine-deep, no kidding. There was a bit of grumbling in my group about the wait (over an hour for our party of six), but you once we got seated it was all good. The waitress came right over and made us feel good about waiting; she was so happy that we had brought our appetites! Literally, elbow to elbow with the other diners but it makes it that much easier to check out what every one else is eating. And the vibe is really great. Four of the six in our party had the shrimp and grits. I had the grillades and grits. Watermelon iced tea for everyone except the person we call Lewis, who chose to have the american style eggs benedict and oj. We ordered beignets, both the standard and crawfish, to share because all of us have been to N.O. before and we know how hard it is to find a good beignet anywhere else. Brenda's beignet's are awesome. The portion sizes are HUGE. This is the place where you say, "Enough, the holidays are over. Now is the time to cut back. Right after I finish this biscuit." I took the remaining portion of grillade and grits, biscuit and crawfish beignet home with me and had it for breakfast this morning. It was still absolutely delish. and I start my post holiday get back to regular eating habits right now. Can't wait to try their crocque monsieur, or oyster po'boy. I'll just need to leave plenty of time.

Not worth the 1 hour and 45 minute wait. We waited that long wondering why it took so long. We blamed the patrons for lingering after finishing their meals regardless of the mile long line out side. I realized the place is tiny. However it was not until we were seated did we  realize that the reason for the miserable wait is the appallingly slow service. For a place that busy I expect the execution and kitchen to be speedy. Dottie's and Canteen have small rooms exceptional food and really well run service. Brenda's was sorely lacking in this department. Now the food. For how long the wait was the food was a collage of execution errors. Granny smith apple beignet had no mention of nutmeg in the menu but  had an overpowering nutmeg punch which drowned out every other flavor mentioned in the menu. The plain beignet was decent but not worth a repeat visit. The chocolate one was decent but not great. The Crawfish beignet was the only one I would order again. The watermelon iced tea was good but not great. I would not crave it on a hot summer day. The coffee was great. The Gumbo had all the right flavors a nice dark roux but was overly salted. I can handle my salt but this was really overly salty. The bananas fosters french toast was  good. The other two dishes our friend's ordered were the andouille omelet which they seemed to like. The fried cat fish eggs benedict was good but not great. The biscuit is too dense and was very hard to cut with the knife. The traditional english muffin would have worked better here. There is a lot to like about Brenda's. May be were there on a really off day. I still can't see myself waiting for that long again. If the wait is short I might try it again. I would not make a special trip from the peninsula just to eat a Brenda's. Sorry.

It seems unnecessarily harsh to deprive Brenda's French Soul Food of that last star given the generally exceptional quality of the food.  What can I say? Innovative, hearty and made with love, the breakfast food there marries American diner classics to a French / Creole sensibility to create spectacular effects without all of the pretense. I confess: my girlfriend and I slipped right in at 11AM on a Thursday, but the line that formed afterwards was remarkable.  We split Granny Smith Apple Beignets, one of which proved remarkably stable in the purse after a day's walk through the city.  I had a veggie omelet with biscuits and potato hash. These were very, very good, but they weren't Oh-My-God-Quit-Your-Job-and-Move-In good.  My girlfriend's Vegan Josephine (tofu and spicy sauce sloppy joe a la Francaise) and the homemade fruit compote for the biscuit?  OMGQYJaMI GOOD. The spot was recommended by yelpster Brad L.  I grow more impressed with his sense of good food every day.  (See my review of Rye in SF)

Beignet flight, watermelon ice tea and cheddar grits!  I have never liked grits but these were good!  Not as good as the crawfish or Ghirardelli chocolate beignets but they were damn good anyway.  There's always a wait to get in but once you do you find out it's worth it, just the people as they leave.

Aside from the 2 plus hours of waiting, 9 dollars in parking meter quarters (next time.. might as well park at AMC parking lot), the place in my book lived up to the hype. The GUMBO before my breakfast hit the spot. The beignets were piping hot....I especially liked the chocolate ones.  For the first time I got the Egg n Bacon Tartine... I was impressed with how light and cripy the the bread was underneath the omelete.  Other people in my group got the Eggs Benidict specials, people around me got the Hangtown special (oyester and bacon sramble).  I also got the grits and I ate the whole thing.. I  It may be a while till I go the next time, it takes a little planning, due to the long wait.  Can't blame the place for the huge lines... maybe the TACO BELL needs to go and they can expand???

Located in the Tenderloin neighborhood, right around the corner from my sister's condo is a very small restaurant apparently known as one of the best breakfast spots in all of San Francisco. Of course we had to try it out. We started with the flight of beignets, which consisted of a plain, an apple, a chocolate and a crawfish beignet. We only ate the plain and the crawfish ones, and were not disappointed at all. (We had the other two wrapped so I could bring my dad something.) While they were not as light and fluffy as I thought they were going to be, the beignets were still perfectly cooked and very good. Especially the crawfish flavored one, which I could easily see myself eating 3 or 4 of them for lunch. Salty, with a nice hint of heat and with a crawfish filling was better than I had expected. Great start so far. For our main breakfast, Abby went with the adouille omelet and I went with the biscuit and gravy special. Both were very filling and with great flavor. The gravy was had a nice hidden sweetness to it and when placed over the biscuit made for a delicious breakfast. Abby had no complaints on her dish at all, other than the potatoes were just above average. However, as much as I can gush over how great our dishes were, I cannot tell you how good their homemade strawberry jelly was. (So good in fact that we wanted to purchase some, but were sadly told they don't sell the jelly yet. I'll have to have my sister get a jar for me when they do start selling the jelly.) Come to Brenda's and have a great breakfast. Hell, come for lunch were their specials included a crawfish and andouille pot pie (which I wish I could have ordered). Just make sure you get a biscuit and some of their jelly. Plus, the music playing was great: nothing like some old Ray Charles to start your day. I give Brenda's a 4 out of 5.

Randomly looked on Yelp for a quality breakfast suggestion and came across some great recommendations for Brenda's.  We tried it- both of us had the Oyster/Bacon Scramble with grits and biscuits.  All, to die for!!!!! The wait was minimal- maybe 10 minutes (11ish on a Friday morning).  I'm definitely going back.

Ahhhh... Brenda's is such a unique breakfast joint. It's such a tiny little hole and yet inside its just a fun, bustling place with friendly people who know how to serve up hearty meals! This kind of food will keep you full for the rest of the day!  Their watermelon tea is really great and original!  Beignets are amazing and I really enjoyed the savory one, spicy Crawfish! I had the fried oysters, bacon and egg scramble once from their specials and it was sooo good, served up with oh so buttery grits and a huge biscuit with an assortment of delicious homemade jams at the table.  It's always crowded here, but the list seems to go by pretty fast. Once we came and signed up and when we came back we just missed our table. That was frustrating, why don't they expand already, it really is a tiny place.

Hands down the best breakfast joint in the city. The only thing I would dock them 1/2 a star for is their extreme popularity. I only brave them once or twice a year because I'm too impatient for a 15-minute line, let alone their standard hour-long wait. Their grits with prawns and bandaged cheddar are to die for!

I only go to Brenda's occasionally, since I am not usually patient enough to deal with the long line.  Today I happened to be up early and the line was not bad at all - maybe only 5-10 minutes for a table for two.  Skipped the beignets, even though they are great, because I knew my meal would be huge.  The grillades and grits were delicious - eggs done how I like them, flavorful meat, yummy biscuit.  My one criticism is that there was a lot of oil in the grillades, enough to skim off in some places.  This is not a dish to order if you are looking for a healthy meal, but it is tasty.  The watermelon iced tea is the best, and it went well with the richness of the food.  All in all, a good meal, and I will be back again.

I know there are a lot of reviews about the wait for this place,  I waited about 15 min. Bottom line, this place has some bomb soul food. I can try and describe the food but I'm not, check out their menu and see what I'm taking about. If I recommend anything it would be there specials...I.E. eggs benedict.      This place is really small so expect glaring eyes and watery mouths as your food is taken to your table. I swear I had someone sitting next to me, stare at my plate till their food came. The service is friendly and quick, the waitress kept refilling my coffee; even though, I just had one sip. If your in the bay area or visiting definitely check it out. Oh parking may suck, but hey it's SF what do you expect.

The food is great, my favorite are the shrimps grits and the fishbignet. My Benedict's were overcooked and dry but the rest was so delicious that it was easy to forget the mistake. So, why only three starts? because one of the waiter is the rudest waitress that I have came across in my life. After complain with the owner, with my big surprise I have found out that she was still mistreating the customer, me included. I went there last Tuesday to order some food to go. I approached her at the door and she gave me right a way a bad look (is she annoying by the amount of people that like this place?). I asked her politely if I could order some food to go. She said yes, turned her back to me and shut the door in front of my face....go for the food, forget about being treated with respect

after visiting new orleans last year, i've been slightly obsessed with southern/soul food. yum! i went with a group of six friends for breakfast around 10am mid-week. there wasn't the usual (from what i hear) line out the door  so we got in pretty quick. we did have to sit at two different tables but that was fine; we were starving. i started off with a crawfish beignet.... amazing. crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. the crawfish filling was perfect. not too runny, lots of crawfish and amazing flavors. and that cajun/old bay type seasoning on top with scallions... yum. i'd snagged a coffee from philz on the way over but still decided to try the watermelon sweet tea. fantastic choice. good flavor, not too sweet, and loved the pieces of watermelon in the tea. also, they fill it up throughout your meal at no additional charge. score. for my breakfast i ordered one of daily specials: the hangtown fry. it was a scramble with fried oysters and bacon. omg. probably the best scramble i've ever had. lots of fried oysters that tasted fresh and were not greasy. the bacon bits were meaty and not fatty. i got the grits and a biscuit as my sides. the grits were creamy and by far the best i've ever had. the biscuit, i feared upon first looking at it, was overcooked as it appeared a little too brown on top. very wrong. it was cooked perfectly and almost fell apart in my hand when i was putting butter on it. highlights from friends meals: shrimp and cheesy grits were actually orgasmic. like you took a bite and were speechless for a few seconds. the portion was huge; my friend took home over half of it. they will definitely be my choice the next time i go. sweet potato pancakes were dynamite. i'm not a big pancake/french toast person so i rarely order them but love it when others do so i can have a bite. very good portions.the beignet was a heck of a lot bigger than i thought it would be and  i definitely was not able to finish my whole meal. the beignet, meal, watermelon tea, and tip ran me $18. not bad at all for the quality and portion size. watch out  brenda! i'll be back!

This place is really good. The donuts are out of this world. You could come in and get donuts and coffee and fill up. The grits were my girlfriends favorite, she said they were the best. I had a special and she had the shrimp and goat cheese omelet. The omelet was amazing, I'm not used to seafood for breakfast tho so the special I had was a different experience. It was fried oysters and bacon omelet. This place is unique and tasty. A must when visiting SF. I will definitely try to go back before I leave for more donuts. You also must try the watermelon iced tea.

This place is wack and wayyyyy overrated.  Everyone always raves about this place and everyone always has the patience to stand in long lines for this place early in the morning.  Don't be fooled.  It is NOT worth it.  Their main breakfast dishes are probably the most mediocre to plain breakfast plates I've ever had (I make better breakfast at home).  Plain omelette and potatoes didn't satisfy me in any way whatsoever.  The only reason they got 3 stars instead of 2 is because they have the Beignets - this was the first time I tried them and they were good and something different.

So I was super excited about chocolate filled beignet. Needless to say I was disappointed! If people here think this is what a beignet is suppose to be they need to go New Orleans and eat a really one. They are suppose to be light and soft these were really dense and hard. Then what they call andouille sausage is more like hillshire farm sausage, not the same flavor as authentic New Orleans. Now their biscuit and homemade strawberry jam was wonderful! They give good portions and are busy but being from the Gulf Coast you couldn't fool me!

I live on the same block as this place, so I have made a habit of ordering out, as there is ALWAYS a line out the door. Always. I adore the fried Oyster Po'Boy. I'm from the south and am very familiar with Creole food. That said, this place isn't ENTIRELY authentic. Definitely has an SF influence. Some of the dishes are a little hit or miss, and almost everything on the menu is very heavy. I'm glad to see that they seem to be expanding their restaurant, maybe I'll actually dine-in once the crowds are less 'out of control'.

i had the cheddar grits with shrimp. it was pretty good. (i must say, i would NOT wait any more than 15 minutes for it.) he ordered from the 'specials' menu. i forget what he had, but he said it was Nothing special. we also ordered the beignets. (sampler plate) the crawfish one had very little crawfish. (although the little it did have, had a nice flavor to it. the rest. were not special at all! they were not soft, rather really hard and doughy. i dont think they were worth it. =/ in one word. OVERRATED. the wait is NOT worth it. DONT DO IT! if u must try it still... i suggest u go really early, and the wait is typically about 15-20 minutes. if you go during lunch or any time after 10am. prepared to have a two hour meal.

I waited almost an 1hr 1/2 to get a seat. I  was very excited because I got recommendations from a friend that this place was awesome. I forget the dish I ordered (unmemorable) it was eggs with provolone over cheese bacon, and sourdough. It was tasty but the salsa ontop ruined it. On the side was potato hash but you could tell it was reheated and even hot sauce and ketchup didn't work to make it tasty. Other selections on the menu seemed nothing extraordinary. The wait isnt worth and the service sucks.

Loved the beingets. Everything I had, including the coffee, was fantastic. We got there at 7:50AM on a Friday and had no wait. I've heard horror stories of the wait on weekends so I think i'll only go during the week.

yum..yum!!! I've only been here one time but i must say, YUP... I'll be back. Shrimp and grits on HIT!! Crawfish beignets...OK..USA!!! I wasn't really feelin' the watermelon tea or I wasn't in the mood (maybe next time). I came with a group of 5 and would suggest don't come with more than a group of 3.

A bunch of us were hoping to get some fried chicken but went on a Sunday and all they serve is a brunch.   No matter, I only wish my stomach was bigger as the food was excellent.  eggs benedict with freid green tomatos and croque monsieur were fantastic.  Kids loved the french toast and the 4 pack of beignets was a favorite as it gave a taste of everything.  The Cajun Bloody Mary was also excellent.

Went to Brenda's on a Friday night. The only negative was the wait - but patience has never been my thing! And as they say; good things come to those who wait - cause the food was excellent. The interior is small, but cute and inviting. You write your name on the chalk board and wait to be seated. Just looking at the dishes being brought out made me all the more excited to get seated and devour everything! They do not have liquor license but informed us we could bring in our own bottle of wine/drink. And we did. It was tough to decide between wine and their Watermelon Ice Tea. I ordered the Cheddar grits and shrimp = Excellent! I had to share with the whole table it was soo good. Macaroni = Excellent Sweet Tea - Delish! Chocolate Chip banana bread pudding - Wonderful Fried Sweet Potato Pie - Tasty!

Fantastic! So good, in fact, that we ate here twice in three days. Came for brunch on Saturday. Waited about 45 min but it was worth it, except that we were hoping for fried chicken. Turns out they only serve fried chicken during the week. Got the beignet flight and decided the crawfish were the best. The gumbo was phenomenal, the catfish on the po' boy was buttery and moist, the mufaletta was delicious. But we had to come back on Monday for the fried chicken. Arrived just before 11am for am early lunch and got seated right away. By 11:10 there was a line. E fried chicken was spectacular! Crunchy outside, moist inside, with just the right amount of spicy and not at all greasy. It rocked! Can't wait to go back!

We had a really bad experience here on a weekday afternoon. My girl friend has been wanting to try Brenda for a long time. We arrived at around 2pm and the restaurant was pretty empty at that time, though we saw the two waitresses running around for nothing. We waited by the front door for awhile. Those waitresses looked at us several times without saying anything. Finally, one of them said: "you guys dont need to wait, just grab a table..."... ok, so we found a table and sat down. After ordering the food, we didnt have too much "interaction" with the waitresses and just tried to enjoy the food. Those Grillades & Grits and Omelet were delicious and watermelon ice tea was also very tasty. After we finished eating, I was going to ask for to-go box for my half-eaten omelet and grits. But before I finished my sentence, the tall-chubby waitress took my omelet (lightning fast) and put other dirty plates on top of it. I was shock and asked "I was going to take this to-go!?" Obviously, she thought that was a statement. So she turned back to the kitchen and dump the dirty omelet, the grits and biscuit all together into a box and brought it back to us. Both me and my girl friend were shocked that 1) she never let either of us finish our request/sentence because she doesn't have the patience for it, and 2) she DUMPED OUR FOOD WHICH SHE HAD JUST STACKED A BUNCH OF DIRTY DISHES ONTO in front of us and just handed back, as if that's OK at any restaurant. We asked (timidly because she already seemed to be so pissed, even when we should be), "Wait, you just put the plates on top of it?... its dirty..." We didn't raise our voice or cause a scene. It was a simple question. But she rolled her eyes and said, "YES. I DID." as if there's nothing wrong in her action or attitude! She then took the box, turned around, still pissy as hell, without saying anything to us so we didn't know whether she was going to provide us with a new order to go, or if she was going to throw it away. I have never ever been to a restaurant and came across a waitress/waiter with such a horrible attitude and a sense of entitlement. Sadly, I will never come back to Brenda again no matter how good the food is, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.

Wow, the grits alone were delicious (Grits, go figure?!!), to that, add a lovely piece of pork belly, and top with a spicy onion relish, every bite from first to last was flavorful, satisfying and good for the soul.  You have to try the Pork Belly special.   I'm sorry for those of you who had to wait so long to get seated, my party of 4 got seated right away at about 10:00 am.  I guess it depends on when you get there and 4/8 was Easter so I guess we got lucky. Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Oh yeah, we took some beignets to-go and had them with good coffee, (their coffee is not very good) later for a mini picnic. They were very good.

Went there after a City Hall wedding last week and everyone cheered the happy couple. All the food was WONDERFUL - flight of beignets (of course), grits that must be tried and the hangtwon fry was reported as delicious. They even let us pop a bottle of our own champagne! A definite staple now that I know about it :)

The crawfish beignets are mouth-watering delicious --  even the bf, who doesn't even like shellfish, says they're the shit!  My favorite is the oyster po-boy sandwich because oysters are a treat for me and I don't get to have them very often.  I love the cole slaw too -- very light and not mayonnaisey at all (I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise), and the grits, oh, the grits -- so buttery, so cheesy.... *drool*.  There is usually a wait to get in on the weekends, but I'm a late sleeper and have never had to wait for more than 10-15 minutes, so that's not too bad.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive too.  I like it!

I want to love this place. The food was good, the restaurant quaint. but the service, was not only horrible, but DISGUSTING. no refills, until the check came.  The part that really chapped (and grossed out) my hide was the fact that we got our remaining begneits and shrimp and grits boxed up to go.  i specifiacally asked the busser to not box up the shrimp on the rim of the plate (next to the shrimp tails that had already been eaten) because it fell on the table.   lo and behold, i go home and the next morning- heat up my food, start eating it and realize i am eating a used shrimp tail. he boxed up EVERYTHING- even the discarded junk. That's like throwing used crab shell into a meal. what a dumas! so i have to throw it away since lord knows the dirty shrimp and other tails are in there. This morning, I go to eat the beignet and there is HALF A BITE of our second beignet that he boxed up. I SHIT YOU NOT.  if he worked at a pizza place, he'd box up the crusts for you to take home. that is just gross, people GROSS this unfortunately ruined an otherwise pleasant experience. If you go there, never ask for a take home bag and you'll be ok.

The restaurant was very busy for Sunday brunch, so my friend and I had to wait a little more than a half hour to get a seat. It's tiny inside, but cozy. Despite the stress that the wait staff was under from the crowd, our waitress was really top-notch polite and efficient, and my friend and I were never made to feel rushed once we were seated. Unfortunately, I have food allergies and the one style of eggs that are best for my allergies (hard boiled) could not be made for me, but my friend's cajun-style omelet looked delicious and she said it was scrumptious. My friend also has allergies to gluten, and Brenda's was able to accommodate her so that she did not have cross-contaminated food, which is a sign of real sensitivity on their part. Don't be fooled by the exterior, this is a lovely place for brunch.

Beginets are to die for...especially the crawfish filled. Gumbo is very good. Catfish PoBoy is good if warm and bun not soggy. Go early and not starving. Wait can be as long as 20 minutes.

Scenario: Went for Brunch on a Monday after the holidays. Hungry during our "staycation" in the City. Getting to the restaurant: We walked and didn't have to worry about parking.  Almost missed it. It's definitely a hole in the wall. It was about 10am. No wait for us fortunately. Key is to come early. When we left around 11am, there was a line outside. Ambiance and Service: Simple, tasteful and modest decor. It is a tiny restaurant. Didn't mind it, though. The service was great, despite the restaurant being full. Courteous, helpful and pleasant. Food: Ahh. The best part. The food spoke for itself. Ordered the special: Banana French Toast - just amazing. The bananas had a wonderful caramelized texture and had just enough sweetness for it not to be overpowering. Some of the caramelization and sweet taste was  carried onto the edges of the french toast (which was perfect btw) when it was fried and this added the right crispyness to balance out some of the soft parts of the french toast.  A dusting of powdered sugar finished it off. I was very, very happy and you will be, too, should you decide to order this lovely dish. Also shared the flight of beignets. Although doughnuts are no where near the level of greatness Brenda's beignets are, to describe what they are, think of gourmet filled doughnuts w/out the holes with a great firm crispy fried exterior. Great texture, good size, just fabulous. Fillings ranged from chocolate to wonderfully seasoned creole crawfish. Hubby had the corned beef hash - everything from the hash (yes, they use real corned beef and red potatoes) to the perfect buttery homemade biscuit and overeasy eggs it came with, all tasted wonderful. Although the hash was more heavy on the potatoes (I tend to like a more equal potato/meat ratio hash), overall it is a solid tasty meal. Loved the homemade raspberry jam on the side. Brenda must have loved us so much, hubby found a hair in his hash dish by the time he was almost done with it. lol Oh wells. At least he finished most of his meal. lol Beverage: Just had water. Pricing: Reasonable for gourmet food like this. Overall review: Highly recommend Brenda's. Take your loved ones and enjoy. Go early to avoid the line. The food is soooo good and worth going.

If you are on a diet, do not even bother looking at the window. Walk away...walk away quickly. Jog or run to the nearest gym. During a visit to SF, a friend told us we were going to Brenda's for Sunday brunch.  As soon as we got closer to the place, the epiphany came.  I should have eaten a snack earlier.  The line was out the door! I peeked in the window and saw what looked like 12 chairs in the whole place. The restaurant was  slighly smaller than my old apartment (600 sq. ft). You definitely needed to be thin to squeeze in between those tables! We were told that the wait would be about 30-45 minutes since we had a "large" group (party of six). The wait turned out to be 1.5 hours. But the wait was soooo worth it. We were seated, luckily, in the "breeze" path (close to the door). I held my breath as everyone was ready to sit down. How much support can the cute little chairs provide for three guys over six feet tall and built like football players? Luckily, we managed to settle down without leaving a trail of destruction behind. I was ravenous and ready to order everything on the menu. Instead, I settled for the watermelon ice tea, beignet sampler (I have decision issues when it comes to bread and sweets) and the bacon and oyster omelette.  Who would have thought such a great invention existed?! OMG! I was in omelette heaven. The rest of our group was divided between the shrimp and grits and the grillades and grits. The service was excellent. Despite the lines out the door, the servers did not give us the evil eye or tried to rush us through the meal.  There's nothing worst than getting your check before finishing the meal. It's almost enough to give a person indigestion. Overall, I love this place and will definitely be back the next time I visit SF. Favorites-the menu changes frequently. The beignet sampler is definitely my favorite. Anything with shrimp and grits. Or bacon. Or eggs and oysters. :-)

FInally, we got to check this place out today.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes this time - could've been longer, but we had no problem taking the counter seat since it was just the two of us.  We did our pre-dining Yelp research and knew we had to try the beignets.  After perusing the menu for a bit, we decided on the Beignet Flight (for variety sake), Cream Cheese French Toast and the Hangtown Fry.   What would a Yelp review be without a bit of food pageantry?  If they're parading around to be eaten, they must be judged.  My personal rankings of the much-hyped beignets: (1) Chocolate - Not as unique as the crawfish and tasted like a chocolate croissant from back in the La Boulangerie days, but the warm melted chocolate married with the deep fry of the beignet earned it's top spot for me. (2)  Crawfish - They sprinkle cayenne pepper on top, I believe, but I thought the crawfish filling could have used a little more spice and heat.  It was tasty, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be. (3)  Plain - Tastes like those Chinese donuts you put in jook.  Definitely not a knock on it, but texture and flavor seemed all too familiar to be special. (4)  Apple Cinnamon - Personal disclaimer: Not a fan of cinnamon.  And this had an overdose of it.  My hubby likes cinnamon and thought it was a bit too much.  At one point I felt like there was so much cinnamon that it started tasted like another spice. (!) The cream cheese french toasts were light and tasty.  They were topped with a blueberry compote which married well with the subtle tart-ness of the cream cheese.  If you're a fan of all things cream cheese, you'll love this dish.  My hangtown fry was up to my expectations of what I've had before.  The oysters tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly.  The biscuits were buttery and flaky and freshly baked when you get your dish.  I've never tried grits, so I thought I'd try that as a side in lieu of potatoes.  Coupled with the fact that I'm not an expert on grits and my repulsion to actually seeing the grease, oil and butter in my food versus it staying hidden, I don't think I'll try these again.  It was in a pool of butter and just tasted more oily than corny.  The Watermelon Sweet Tea was pretty refreshing.  Think Watermelon Slush Honest Tea party.  Clean, defined refreshment.  I'd get it again, esp. on a warm day.   Definitely not worth a 2 hr wait as some fellow Yelpers have commented, but a half hour is definitely palatable.  Not a place I could go to often either because of the heaviness of the food.  Craving grease and comfort food on a cold, rainy day - this is your place.

Went there early for lunch at 11am - got in easily. The gumbo was very good as was the shrimp po' boy. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. The table next to us had the crawfish beignet - it looked excellent, which they confirmed. I'm looking forward to going back soon for brunch. Bananas Foster french toast sounds amazing. Everything was reasonably priced under $10 and wait staff DID NOT have attitude - very nice.

Ok, so I give 5 stars because the food was so amazing that several people at our table had religious experiences when eating the beignets and drinking the watermelon ice tea. However we waited 2 1/2 hours (!!!) to get in on a sunday at 12:30 PM, and were pretty frustrated by that. Bigger place pleeasseee! And for godness sakes, never attempt coming here in a group- keep it to two people and your wait might be cut in half. Amazing food though! Will be back (in pairs)!

brenda's soul food is amazing. it's like edith piaf's la vie en rose. you WILL most likely have to wait. the place is small and seats maybe 30 (although i saw a sign quoting that it can hold the likes of 50). if nothing in life is more important then where you'll eat for dinner. then by that philosophy you should enjoy the process of getting to breakfast as much as eating it or walking out to the street after. its all too short to get disgruntled while you are waiting "too" long to eat. the worst part of my breakfast was while waiting for our table. an angry man in a 9 person group demanded that the waiter do a "better job because [shes] not doing good enough" at seating his group. wtf. these people should stay at home and take up a full time position at being bad neighbors. that or be eating at lori's diner. I should say that I'm a coffee person. I (am a feeling that's really close to) love coffee. its always flowing. my coffee stays warm, full and dark with a perfect mix of chicory and cream. i ordered the shrimp omelet. i finished the shrimp omelet AND my friends grits. they go perfect with the hot sauce on the table. yum. yum. a million times yum. AND the price...very reasonable for the food/overall dining experience.

Beniets. Need I say more? Deliciousness. The flight of em' is a must if you've got a few mouths that are hungry. Crawfish, cheese, scallion? Heaven. And thats just the start. The rest of the menu is mouthwatering. The specials are sublime. The coffee with chicory makes me feel like I'm back in the french quarter, enjoying a nice snack at cafe du monde. The one draw back? It's a hot spot. You gotta get there early if you're going to go on the weekends or for lunch....if not, expect a wait. But its worth it.

Can't go wrong here. Everything is fantastic from the fries to the Po'boy. Beniegts (sp?) are to die for. Been in several times and just too lazy to write a review but have to say that this place always rocks. Word of caution- the wait can be horrendous...like up to an hour and a half sometimes.

After eating here a half dozen times myself, I finally got hubby to come with.  We stood in line for 2 hours. I had eggs benedict w/catfish-PURE BLISS!!  Hubby had Andouille omelet and really liked it for being "old school"- meaning not fluffed up or pretentious.And don't get me started on the peach preserves.. Verdict from hubby?  "Worth the wait" Word to the wise, do NOT go at lunchtime on weekdays or after noon on the weekend.  Go early on weekends or go after 2 on weekdays.

This tiny little hole in the wall is a great place for an intimate breakfast, once you get seated (can take a while on the weekend especially if you have a group bigger than 3). The sign on the wall says it can seat 40 but it seemed more like 60 people.  Cramped and bustling with the kitchen in small hallway just behind the counter.  Everything you would expect from hole in wall.   The food was very enjoyable.  French toast with a butter pecan syrup was good but the brioche was lacking in character. The molasses ham creole benedict was declared a hands down winner by the GF. And the hash was the best I have ever had. Will be telling others to patronize when in the area.

Having my whole family be from Louisiana and them both being real creole (speaking creole French and all) this place is for people that have never had real creole food and are being tricked into this california Cajun bland style. First of all this is poor people food, prices shouldn't be hi anywhere, second I saw frozen vegetables being reeled in while eating! Ooooops! Third no such thing as Philipino creole, doesn't exist (creole Is French mixed with caribean and or native American and sometimes portuguese, in which I'm all of them), fourth lesbian man haters is not very San Francisco at all! ( unless you want to bring that bad vibe to this but San Fran is not about that). Beignets are the only thing going for them, but anyone can get that recipe on the street. So if you want non authentic man hater creole food, than this is your place!

My husband and I have eaten here a couple of times. The first time was awesome! But the second time, a little disappointing-- we got there really early and got seated right away (after a 4.5hr  flight from Honolulu). Ordered the flight, and the shrimp omellete with grits, all great. We cannot enjoy the food. Given the fact , the place is too small. (And it's in the tenderloin neighborhood). We were constantly bothered and hurried by the wait staff, asking if they can boxed any food, when we just sat at the table 20 minutes ago!  There are plenty of other great SF restaurants to spend $50 for two for breakfast and eat at your leisure.

We, a party of 2, arrived at 9:30 on Saturday. Waited for about 45 minutes - so that sort of builds the anticipation.  I'm a lover of soul/southern food, so I was pretty excited about this dining  experience. We ordered the beignets, my sentiments are similar to other reviewers... chocolate was too rich, apple pie was "eh" (McD's is better), the crawfish was SPICY but good. I ordered the egg tartine. By definition tartine is a French open-faced sandwich, especially one with a rich or fancy spread. This was scrambled eggs with cheese on bread with bacon. The tomato relish was interesting, tangy, and much needed on the otherwise bland dish.  My husband had the eggs benedict with molasses ham. The ham was very very sweet - too sweet. The "spicy" creole hollandaise was actually bland. The potato hash was mush, also bland. The grits were tasty.... as long as you dont mind a layer of butter floating on top.  Service was good, once ordered the food arrived fast. Very small and cramped location. Needless to say, my expectations were not met. With so many numerous tasty eateries in SF, we will not return to Brenda's.  Brenda's French Soul Food was SOUL LESS on this particular day.

Ok--after being a regular consumer of yelp reviews--Brenda's is what finally pushed me to give one back after my first visit   As former resident of the Crescent City, Brenda takes the crown as the best New Orleans food that is not in New Orleans I've had since leaving. Definitely recommend the crawfish stuffed Beignets.   And give the chicory coffee a try--its an acquired taste--but they have the real deal there.  We went the brunch special route--and they both rocked.  Next time I'll put the shrimp and oyster po-boy to the test. As noted elsewhere-- You'll stand out on the sidewalk waiting 4 brunch, just like you do for the old school places in New Orleans--and just take it as a good thing and get your mouth ready for a party.  (planning for a nap afterwards is not a bad idea either--it's a lot of food)

Where should I start?  The wait or the food? I've heard about this place from a friend who says it's "DAMN GOOD".  About 7 of us came here on a Saturday at 1pm.  There were still 15 people on the list and this place closes at 3pm.  We put our name on the list and decided to walk to grab a snack since this was going to be about a 2 hour wait.  After waiting about 45 mins to an hour some people in our group decided to eat elsewhere.  Disappointed...we went to eat somewhere else.   The next day, 5 of us decided to come back and try this place.  This time at 9am in the morning.  There were a few people on the list, but it wasnt too bad.  We put our name down and waited in the freezing cold San Francisco.  We waited about 30 minutes (not bad!) and finally got our table.  The 5 of us pretty much ordered half of the menu.  The waitress told us that the portions were big, but we didnt care because we were hungry and never know when we will be lucky enough to sit in here without a long wait.   The place was small, but the food was damn good!  The gumbo was my favorite!  The bowl was huge.  That really filled me up, but I still had my cat fish benedict coming.  The cornbread french toast was YUMMY!  It was two pieces of toast (which did not look filling according to the boys), but they did not even finish one!  The oatmeal pancakes are ginormous!  It was really great!  My other friend ordered the shrimp poboy and loved it!  My brother ordered the omelet and finished everything except for the potatoes.  Everything was extremely tasty!  I love the watermelon ice tea!  It was refreshing and sweet!   I would come back, but I'm probably going to have to come around 8-9am in order to be seated within 30 minutes!  Two thumbs up!

Now this is really, really  good breakfast/brunch spot.  Better than Mama's which I went to as well.  I had the beignet sampler which was okay but my wife had the grillade and grits, omg!, that is quite possibly the best breakfast dish that I have had in awhile.  Along with the watermelon ice tea, I was in heaven.  Definitely, recommend this spot.

I am such a fan of this restaurant!!! I stumbled upon a review on Yelp of this place, and the "french soul food" description cuaght my eye.  I went to New Orleans about 5 years ago and fell in love with the food.  My family is from the south, so I am no newbie to grits, but items like beignets were a treat to be discovered on my first trip down to New Orleans.  Ever since then, I search out Cajun food.   Anyways, my good friend Alison and I decided to go here for brunch on sunday.  I was not disappointed. We arrived to see a huge line, and decided to stick it out.  After TWO HOURS, we were finally seated.  Let me say, the only reason that this place is receiving four stars instead of the five, is the wait.  But, people kept telling us, "Its worth the wait!" as they came out from the place, and boy do i agree.  Totally worth it. Once seated, I got the watermellon sweet tea.  Wow. Sooo good.  Watermellony, but not overwhelming or fake.  I think I may have had at least three glasses of this stuff. Alison and I split the beignet flight so we could try all the flavors.  All three of the sweet ones were great, but I was not too much of a fan of the crawfish one. Maybe I just loved the chocolate filled one so much that I couldnt properly enjoy the catsifh one?  Possible. For our main courses, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Po Boy (one more thing down on my 7x7 top 100 list!!), and a side of grits.  Both were FABULOUS. Overall, the food is amazing, the ambiance and servers were great.  Soo worth it. My only suggestion is to get there early if you don't want to wait.  I'll probably be there too, waiting patiently for the amazing food, so say hi!

Went on a weekday during lunch, had the oyster po boy which came with either fries or coleslaw glad I chose coleslaw as it was prepared just how I like it-not too sweet and not too heavy on the dressing perfectly balanced flavor. Sat at the bar counter as I popped in on my own, had the watermelon tea which is great as they keep filling your glass.  I not only studied the menu for future reference and was happy to see they serve breakfast all day because all of it sounded delish.  Next time I will have the crawfish beignet and perhaps the hangtown fry which was a special that day.  The biscuits looked divine and huge as were most of the food portions I observed.   Only problem was I did not have the appetite of a horse which would've allowed me to order more, so I plan many more visits to Brenda's.  Popular and busy, staff really nice, great service. Would love to do weekend brunch but I imagine lines are long but worth the wait!

On a day when I got out of work early, I ventured the walk from the Civic Center Bart station to Brenda's despite the rain, cold and savage wind.   I had to do what I had to to get me a po-boy sandwich! I arrived and good gawd the wait list was LONG.  I added my name in the little space available at the bottom of the paper.  Within 5 minutes, I heard my name and was glad that I was eating solo.  The couples I had to pass to get into the restaurant eyed me with such detest. I had the watermelon iced tea first.  Very refreshing as everyone says, and it was the next best thing to actual watermelon juice. The crawfish beignets came next and I was surprised at how good they were.  You bite into it  and everyting just hits you - the crispy deep fried dough, the chunks of crawfish in a cayenne peppery goo.  The cayenne pepper gave the whole dish a nice kick.   I didn't think I had enough room for the fried shrimp po-boy after the beignets, but I pushed on.  The sandwich was good, but nothing extraordinary. I definitely want to come back and try their breakfast menu.

I have never ever been disappointed by this place. They have such wonderful staff, cooks, and a fantastic menu. Come here for your healthy hearty breakfast or brunch. Expect a wait because this place is one of the hottest places going on in the Trendy Loin. Just show up and sign your name on the clipboard at the door and you're all set. Hang out with all the interesting people like you who can hardly wait to be next to be called to take a seat inside. After that, it is all heaven. What ever you like, it's probably there. All great; the service, healthy food, great beverages, and such great vibes. You come out of here feeling like you just started the day right with some delicious and healthy food.

Brenda's serves absolutely delicious and authentic soul food. Only problems are that you might die of hunger waiting for a table or even later during your meal as your risk for a coronary doubles with every bite you eat. I would recommend the shrimp and goat cheese omelette, the catfish benedict & the grillades and grits. My friends and I ordered these so I had to try all of them and, by the end, my insides were groaning and I could hear the cholesterol dripping like a leaky faucet inside me.  And then came the shocker - our dessert order of beignets and french toast was large enough to feed the entire restaurant. We struggled in vain but had to take home a large portion of it. Definitely come here hungry, but realize that you might not survive the wait for your table.

Awwwhh I found out about this place on Yelp and decided to try it. I went early on Saturday morning. My wait wasn't very long compared to other reviews I read. I suggest getting there early and not to come with a large party more than 4 people you may have a long wait. I had the sweet potato pancakes with pecan maple syrup....oh my goodness to die for...the watermelon tea was amazing...I like my tea a little sweeter so once I added sugar it was good to go. I love this place and whenever I visit SF again this will be my go to place for good breakfast and great service!

I've been here twice and all I can say their food is worth every penny.  we ordered their beignets, andouille & cheddar omelette, their special omelette with fried oysters and the banana foster for under $30.

The food here is amazing. Hands down, food is first class. The service is pretty shoddy. In general the wait is about 30 minutes to get in, and then ANOTHER 30 to 40 minutes for food to get here. What kind of restaurant takes HALF AN HOUR to serve food? The girls are generally too busy to really pay attention to individual customers.

Food was great.  I was really looking forward to the beignets, but they were definitely not the same as the New Orleans beignets.  However, the crawfish beignet has a unique flavor.  One of the special of the day was the Hangtown Fry, which were eggs with oysters and bacon. It was good and the biscuit was simply amazing with their peach compote.  I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu, but not the beignets.  If you are concerned about your diet, then this is not the place for you.

Really wanted to like this place, but the hype just didn't live up to the insane wait inside. We got the egg scramble with the oysters. Oysters were good, but it was just off. It didn't blow my mind like I was expecting. Had the ginger/pumpking pancakes and that was a little dry. Overall it was solid food, but definitely wouldn't wait through that line.

We waited over an hour in line to get into this small little crowded hole in the wall. OMG, it was worth every freezing, uncomfortable second!! The food was amazing. Everything was so full of flavor. My favorite are the chocolate beignets, but the crawfish was great too! Get the chocolate to go, you're going to want them later! I've tried the grillades and grits, the andouille sausage & cheddar omelette, and the eggs Benedict with catfish. Each of them were simply heaven!!  You have to try this place at least once in your lifetime.

Reading about the ridiculous wait times, we came here early on Sunday around 830am and waited for about 10-15 min before we were seated. Parking that early on a Sunday was easy to find.  Inside the place was small, I def would not go here with a group of more than 4. Having heard about the Beignet Flight, that was first on the list and it did not disappoint.  Definitely eat the crawfish one first and then save the others for after your meal as a dessert or to-go. Each beignet was about the size of my fist, could easily be shared with 3-4 people.   On the specials board was the Hangtown Fry and for some reason everytime I see a Hangtown Fry on specials board I have to try it.  And hands down the best I've ever had. Huge chunks of Oysters that were lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly as well as nice pieces of bacon. The hash potatoes that came with it were also nicely seasoned with some green onions and some herbs.   Overall a great meal and definitely lived up to its fame.

Beignets were tough as shoe leather, so skip those.   Portion sizes were obscene, so it's best to split an order with someone else.  Plus, if you don't care for it, you'll only have half as much.  So-so service, but the late-lunch crowd kept the servers busy.

we came up to SF for my friend's birthday and before we even left LA my other friend, her boyfriend, said that we need to come here. he loves french food, he loves soul food, and everybody loves breakfast foods. the line was a little longer, and even a little longer for us because we were waiting for a table for 5. all in all we waited maybe 1hr - 1hr 15mins. the services was excellent. the waitress had perfect timing for when to come for refills or to take out order. i personally like room temperature water when it's a little colder outside, and they had that. I'm sure if you asked for ice they would give it to you considering there was huge vat of it next to me when they were making their watermelon ice tea. the table decided to split the a beignet flight so we could try all the different flavors. they were all delicious and just the right amount of sweet, but my favorite was the savory. (i forgot the name) i decided to order the our eggs Benedict w/ fried chicken with a side order of bacon. out of all the food that i have had in SF, or in life for that matter, cannot top the experience that i had when i took my first bite. after that, the table was pretty much silent only lifting our heads or clearing our mouth for conversation, only to comment on how delicious the food was, or to ask the waitress for more water. if you're ever in San Fransisco, make sure you stop by here. it is a definite must.

If I knew how to do 3.5 stars I certainly would have. The other 1.5 stars are waiting for above good flavor and a host/ess that is focused on those that are waiting. Decent food only worth the wait if you have time to spare... Order ahead, get it to go and make a picnic in the park! This weekend we took a chance on trying something new. My wife found it and I researched it. We were meeting some old friends on their home turf and I wanted to treat them to something special. Let the search begin. After reading the reviews, I tracked the surroundings and the distance to everything and everyone coming. Not too bad, muni, bart and cab available. After all if you're meeting friends, you have to find a destination worth eating at. Conversation follows you everywhere, but food is for talking about later after you've enjoyed the company, but on a good day you find a place that will make you remember being there; together, and exactly what you and everyone else ate. A true memory... forever... Brenda, I have to say the crawfish Beignets were truly savory, only thing I would ask was a bit more Crawfish... We had the flight and the crawfish and plain were perfect, the other 2 were under cooked and lacked the loving flavor we hoped for from "soul food and a french cafe..." The sweet potato pancakes should be a regular item on the menu and the shrimp and grits should come with a cholesterol warning for the amount of cheese. The other entrees were as average as really good apple pie... Now for the rough stuff. Ok so lets start with the beginning of the event. We got there 30 minutes before we told everyone else to get there so we could secure a table hopefully within minutes of everyone arriving on the hour. I asked if they would mind if I had a cup of coffee and wait outside for our table to be called. A stretch to ask, but we're planning on being patient and I haven't slept in a while. "Sure" the host says and even provides cream and sugar at the door so I know I'm not the first. That was clue #1... We wait outside for the other 3 in our party of 5 and talk about tales of the tinderloin and the differences during the day and then the night. The coffee is plain jane... 30 minutes on the dot, our friends show up as planned... We talk, hug, laugh and wait for our 5 top table... It's fine to wait if you're ready, but there does come a limit when you're there before the crowd. It's a small spot with tons of 2 top tables. If you're a party of 3 or more, make sure you're in the face of the hostess, if not you're easily overlooked because so many people leave BECAUSE of the wait. There are only a couple of waiters/tresses so be kind to them by the time you actually sit down. 1.5 hours later and 2 cups of coffee, we're ready for food and edgy about those who have been sat down ahead of us. No worries, I hear the food is great and we've got great company... or so I hear and read... Beignet flight to start, to follow: Daily special Pancakes, French Toast, Tartine, Benedict and shrimp & grits were ordered within seconds of sitting. The watermelon tea did not disappoint, if you're a lover of melon. The kitchen was incredibly fast, after all the food is savory not complicated. The wait staff are basically short order cooks, with the wait time at the door, you might as well order as you're being seated.   They did forget my gumbo soup, but the overall portions were truly decent and overflowing with grits depending on the dish. The home fries / hash browns are as regular as diner potatoes, saturated w/ oil and herbs.  and lacked true sophistication... Poached eggs were spot on, my scrambled eggs were like a soft omelet with no fillings, the pancakes were nearly an inch thick in the middle and thin on the outside, making them resemble a track & field discus. The butter/pecan topping "made" the pancakes and french toast. Benedict's should have a sampler platter to enjoy the variety of what else they have... The tartine was decent and really good if you're famished. By the time you're finished, you'll have been there 2.5 - 3 hours. Bottom line, it's a good thing to try...

After hearing about this place and reading Yelp, we had to try it.  We went for breakfast, got there around 9:15am, 45 minute wait. We ordered the Beignet Flight.  One each of their flavors: crawfish: okay, chocolate (if you love loads of bittersweet chocolate, this is for you.  Too chocolaty for us... a chocolate pudding or mousse filling would have been better for our taste, apple:  okay, plain:  the ones at Cafe DuMonde in New Orleans were much lighter and loads of powdered sugar. Breakfast:  hubby got the special bacon/tomato eggs Benedict.  He said okay.  i got one of the house favorites:  Grillades & Grits.  Don't care for grits, substituted with hash.  The grillades is beef cutlets with creole sauce.  A beef cutlet to me is what you buy in the store.  A less choice piece of beef that is pounded to tenderize.  These were 2 slices of beef with creole sauce.  Hubby tried it, he said it tasted like beef stew.  It was good, but I have to agree with him. Now, there was homemade peach jam on our table.  Big chunks of peach... I spread it on the biscuit.  It tasted like peach cobbler but with the biscuit on the bottom  That was delicious!

When my wife told me we're going to have French food for breakfast, I immediately hesitated and try to find excuses not to go. You see, I view the French much the same way that I view Lane Bryant models. I don't. All I know is they hate us and the feeling, as far as I'm concern, is mutual. Not being able to find a suitable excuse to get out of this, I find myself sitting at one of their table after a 10 minute walk from our hotel. We ordered the granny smith beignets which was extraordinary. It's like apple pie inside a doughnut and they topped it off with powder sugar. Be warn, you will have Tyrone Biggums lips after you're done with this dish. Just scratch your neck a lot and you'll be cool. I ordered the hangtown fry just because it had oyster. (My wife loves all things oyster and I wanted to get brownie points so I can go wine tasting later). It was tasty in a very unique way. Think oyster omlette meet jambalaya. If you like oyster you'll like this dish. They definitely don't short-change you here. The wife ordered fluffy buttermilk pancakes to share with our daughter and it came out exactly as advertised. All in all, we enjoyed our meal tremendously. Enough to change my view on the French? Nope, these cats are French Creole from Louisiana. Which makes them red blooded Americans. So I still hate the French.

Got a recommendation for Brenda's while visiting some friends in town, and I couldn't have been happier with the restaurant.  It goes down as one of the favorite things I did in San Francisco. I had french toast with butter pecan syrup, a side of molasses ham, and a cappuccino.  It was all great,  right down to the coffee (even though my choices were probably too sweet to go together). Thanks for the great breakfast Brenda's, see you next time I'm in town. -One more thing, I was there on a Tuesday at about 9am and waited about 30 minutes.  I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend.

this place is amazing. One of the best shrimp po boys i've ever had. Authuentic corn-meal dusting on the shrimp instead of a heavy batter. Outstanding tangy mayo sauce and super soft french roll. The gumbo was outstanding too. Thickened with okra, a deep and tasty roux. The biscuits are amazing as well. Fantastic.

my experience at Brenda's was great! good coffee, good service, great atmosphere and near to where i live. But the food was ok fine. I really wanted to like it more and had only a few expectations about the food since i heard great review about it. i really try to make my owe opinion after i experience a highly reviewed establishment and not be bias. the food as a rich and thick like a southern breakfast should be but didn't have that punch for wonderfulness i hope for. I would highly encourage you to experience Brenda's. i've only been once and can't wait to go back to try another dish. but for now my one breakfast dish, turkey hash, and two platefuls of beignets were ok fine.

Although this place was not totally unpleasant, I do not think that their food is authentic New Orleans food.  The taste is not there.  The basics are not there.  Instead they go off on a tangent, that doesn't really taste all that good.  I found the breakfast to be greasy and bland.  And the beignets with crawfish to be overly dry and to have a texture that seems to indicate that they were trying too hard.  Imagine my disappointment literally coming straight off a plane from New Orleans that day hoping for something similar. I would agree with those that say that you have to wait a long time, you can't see the menu written on a mirror, and that it is cramped.  Also I saw drugs (specifically crack) being dealt from a red car about 500 feet from the entrance.  But when it doesn't even have the food, how can it deserve a high rating? If you are going there for the food, don't go.  If you want to go see other people. there are crowds.  Eventually people will get bored. They are close though.  I would like to see them start by going back to the basics of New Orleans (starting with a full bar).  And to upgrade the quality of the beignets to light and airy instead of the biscuit in the can texture you see.  Perhaps they mat eventually serve fresh crawfish as well.

The grillades were pretty good and the grits were amazing. I didn't really like the beignets, because they were a bit too hard. I waited for an hour before I got to sit down. I think it's worth the wait, but they need a better or a more organized host to assign tables. Walking through the half opened kitchen to get to the restroom was the highlight of the whole meal. It is definitely one of the most efficient and energetic kitchen that I've ever seen.

BREAKDOWN: FOOD = 3.5  Stars PRICE = $15 range FOOD-PRICE Ratio = 3 Stars (Considering it's SF) SERVICE = 3 Stars FOOD CONSISTENCY = 5 Stars SERVICE CONSISTENCY = 3 STARS RECOMMENDED: - Biscuits - Omelets - Grits COMMENTS: One of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch. One of the best biscuits I have ate, and probably the worst one for my heart. The grits are more like polenta, but it still good (especially with extra butter.) My wife always order the omelets (shrimp and goat cheese or veggie) and they are always good. Almost everybody orders the beignets, and even though I always order them, I have a love-hate relationship with them. They are good, but they seem to have a "out of the freezer" after taste, especially the crawfish ones. I still suggest them though. One of my favorite breakfast/brunch food is corned beef hash, but I didn't quite like Brenda's version. I suggest the grillades and grits instead. Just make sure you get their early, for there is always a wait.

I took a couple of tourists to the dark and twisty Tenderloin to experience Brenda's. Both Omelettes ordered (veggie and Andouille and Cheese) were very good with the perfectly flaked cream biscuits. Grits and hash were seasoned appropriately. I had their French toast filled with cream cheese topped with toasted walnuts, blueberry compote with a side of whipped butter. Delightful although I could not finish it all. Tourists gave the thumbs up. Yes, you will wait an hour if you don't get there by 10AM, but maybe Brenda should take a hint and knock down a wall to the garage next door and take it over.

This place has amazing food- the biscuits are OMG, crazy good !!! There's always a long wait, unless you go very early. And while this is expected when we visit San Francisco, I went with 4 other people and the waitress found it nearly impossible to figure out how to seat us. We waited 45 minutes while she sat party after party and gave away 2-top after 2-top. Finally, my friend went in and got snarky with her and we got ourselves a table. Waitress turned out to be really nice, just not so smart with the tables I suppose.

Simply love it!!! I brought my friend here once and she became directly completely addicted to it... she then brought her own friends and... guess the following... ;-) Everything I've ever tried over there was really good! Especially the veggie omelette and plain beignet!!! Well I have to say that they surely have better beignets in Europe but hey!... Europe is Europe and Brenda's are fine too. Service is pretty good. They are usually very nice eventhough one of the waitresses seemed kinda annoyed the last time I've been there... well it's true that this place is hell crazy busy!!! Always have to wait long long time... the place is pretty small but I like it though 'cause it's cozy. But you might not have the time to appreciate it though 'cause it's really too busy and people are waiting outside to have a seat! But believe me it's worth it!!!

I took someone here for a birthday brunch and it was awesome! I had the egg and bacon tartine which was wonderfully rich, flavorful and well, yummy! The chef does an interesting twist on soul food, mixing in French and, I think, Philipino influences. The only downside is the wait. We went pretty early (9 a.m.) and only waited about 25 min on a Saturday, but I hear it's longer if you go closer to noon. Would love to go back again.

I loved this place - the only downside was waiting outside for about 45 minutes, but once we finally got in it was well worth it. We took our 18-month old baby - there was no room in the restaurant so they had to put the stroller in the back (which was nice for us). They did have a high chair. I highly recommend the beignet flight because you get $20 worth of beignets for $8. The crawfish beignet was by far the best one.

My wife and I had breakfast at Brenda's and it was well worth the wait you likely will experience on a weekend. Because space is at a premium, you will wait in line outside. We waited for about 45 mins before being seated. But as I said to start, well worth it. We shared their beignets sampler, which included an excellent catfish variety. From there, I had one of the specials, which was a molasses pork chop with sweet potato hash and their famous biscuits. Portions are big so definitely not leaving hungry. Everything was delicious, pork chop was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Hash was tasty, and the aforementioned biscuit was a pure pleasure to eat. I travel to San Francisco for business, I will wait again on my next visit for breakfast at Brenda's! Highly recommended.

Everything you need to know about this place has been related in the many, many reviews already written. The line to get in is LONG, even on weekdays. Don't go with more than a group of 2 -- four tops are rare, and you might wait forever for a table for six. The biscuits, crawfish beignets and watermelon iced tea are all fab. Yadda yadda.. The reason I had to write this review is to sing a little paean to one particular dish, one of my favorite food creations ever: the shrimp and grits, which is a special and I am always hoping will get upgraded to a regular dish. It seriously might be on the list of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Imagine a piping hot plate of grits, swimming with cheese (so hot and cheesy that the oil has separated and soaked the grits) with a mound of shrimp on top, cooked with bacon bits and tomatoes. The grits are hot, oily, rich and cheesy. The shrimp and the tomato/bacon relish is a glorious complement. It's not a dish for the faint of heart, or those who excessively worry about their heart health. It's ridiculously decadent, and I usually order it with a biscuit, making it even moreso. I don't order it every time I go here (because I don't wanna die and leave an attractive corpse -- I wanna look like a zombie when I go out!), but I long for it all the time. I will cry the day Brenda takes it off her Specials board and pray for the day it gets upgraded to the regular menu.

Beignets.  I did not try anything else so this is a very focused review.  I tried the flight since I hadn't been here before and had heard so much about it.  Average; definitely not N.O. style.  Fortunately, the flight (4 beignets) is only $8 rather than the average of $5 each. All the beignets were less than light, and all had a crispy crust - not bad but not a beignet.  The Cajun was spicy and could be a nice accompaniment with a southern-style dish.  The chocolate was average at best as was the apple-cinnamon.  Take a lesson from the doughnut people on how to fill a light pastry.  The plain was tasty enough but still not light. I would go back to try some of the real food, but the beignets just were not that good.

This place is hugely overrated. GOOD: First, the food is not too bad. On the other hand, it's hardly possible to screw up omelet or potatoes. I have no experience in cooking grits, but by the looks of this dish, it's also not a big deal to cook. I was impressed with the beignets: those were really good and are not so easy to make. BAD: If you want to walk around smelling like you've been deep fried all day, this is the place to go. Only 5 minutes in there, and you're good to go. It's unbelievably crammed. A sign on the wall says it can seat a maximum of 40 people. When we were in there, I counted 26 people and it was full. It does not seem to care so much about hygiene. The cutlery did not look very clean. When someone leaves, they just wipe the table with a not so clean towel. They even spilled some milk on a neighbouring table and then spread it over the whole table with the towel. After that, I understood why the menu cards felt so sticky. The neighborhood where it's situated is also not so great. The walk there was not of the most pleasant. It seems most people go there for the food. I love food, but eating is not just about that. It has to be a more complete experience in order to be enjoyable: the environment, the presentation, the company etc... and this place did not hit the spot for me.

The restaurant is tiny, but the food is worth it.  I would suggest ordering to go if you're not up for a long wait on the weekends or not in the mood to hang out with strangers.  The seating area is tiny and you are bound to get an elbow or two during your meal.   This last trip I had the shrimp po'boy and it was the BEST I had outside of New Orleans.  The chipotle sauce is amazingly good.  And, the portions at the restaurant are really big.

They have all-day breakfasts, complete with eggs, bacon and other stuff on the menu. And my god, I can't stop thinking about their beignets. Those are wickedly and sinfully delicious!

This place is so amazing, that it prompted me to actually get an account and write about how great the food is after using yelp for reviews for a couple of years.   I went there with a couple of friends from out of town on a Sunday morning around 11 a.m.  The wait was long-ish, but not unreasonable, but after going inside I was amazed at how fast people were making it through.  The place is tiny!   BEIGNETS We ordered the beignet sampler plate and it had something for everyone.  I wasn't a huge fan of the savory beignet, but I think pastries should be sweet.  The plain and apple filled were to die for.  The chocolate beignet was a little too chocolatey for my tastes, but still very good.   COFFEE No breakfast on the town would be complete without coffee.  The cups are large, and the servers or runners keep coming by to fill your mug.   BREAKFAST GOODIES I had the sweet potato pancakes off of the specials menu.  They were the best pancakes I've had in my life.  They came with a maple brown sugar syrup and pecans on top.  Plus, they're huge--about the size of my face. My fried ordered catfish eggs bendict with the potatoes.  The breakfast potatoes were a little smushy like they might have been parboiled or steamed before going in the pan-- exactly how I like them.  They were nicely seasoned, but not spicy. Her boyfriend ordered granola pancakes and a biscuit.  He didn't love them, but I have to disagree.  He left them in my fridge as leftovers and I went to town on those babies.  After the beignets we were all stuffed so he left about a pancake and a half for me.  It lasted for breakfast for two days.    The biscuit was amazingly buttery.  I had forgotten about it in the fridge, when I went rummaging for a snack three days later.  I was skeptical that it would be even remotely enjoyable after so much time, but I popped it in the microwave with a prayer.  It was still so buttery and flakey.  Perhaps, again, the best biscuit of my life.   The one downside--the prices are a little higher than I would like to pay for breakfast, but it is more than worth it.

I really loved this place, and it was worth the wait to come here for lunch with three friends. The menu was mouth-watering, I wanted to try everything. It'd been years since I'd last had catfish so I went for the eggs benedict on fried catfish with grits. We also split some crawfish beignets and I had a cup of coffee, which was pretty good as well. The crawfish beignets had delicious filling. It was my first beignet so I had no point of reference, but it was a positive experience. And the eggs and catfish were just sublime. My taste buds were singing. I'd never had grits before, and this was a great first experience. I'd like to come back and try everything else on their menu. Everything my friends ordered looked phenomenal as well.

Our group of 3 showed up on Sunday at 12:30, was eating by 1:15.  Thought that was a reasonable wait for food this good.  Also thought the price was very reasonable.  That being said I did have a few gripes...first if you're a fan of Cafe Du Monde's beignets you'll find Brenda's quite a bit heavier and more cake-like.  But they are quite delicious in their own right.  We couldn't decide whether the chocolate or apple was better.  Both were fab.  Second, the vegan in our group was dismayed that the vegan option is not offered on the weekends, and they won't make it for you even if you ask.  The only reason he agreed to come was because there was a vegan sandwich on the lunch menu.  Really...why would you offer a vegan option only on certain days?  Seems you'd do it every day or not at all.

Another winner in my book.  Went in on a Tuesday around 1pm.  No wait No line.  Yay for us.  We've been wanting to try this place out and finally ... we did and it was worth the wait.  We had the beignet's sampler plate - Loved it and so did the kids.  We also tried their French Toast Special ... the kids ate every piece and hubby and I had to steal a few pieces.  Yum.  I had the Fry Basket - I enjoyed it ... mix of fried prawns/oysters/cat fish/fries and lastly hush puppies.  Not a hush puppy fan so that was not touched but overall - good dish if your in the mood for fried food.  Hubby had the fried chicken and he was in love with it and the corn bread that came along with.  We can't wait to bring the rest of the fam back.

The good - The food!  The flight of beignets was delicious.    I can drink the watermelon sweet tea all day.  I got the fried chicken with biscuit.  Have had better less greasy fried chicken in my life but that biscuit was to die for.   My husband had the shrimp and grits and it was cheesy goodness.   The portions are huge and affordable. The not so good - Oh the wait..the agonizing wait.   It was morning, we all needed a cup of coffee so some of the people in my group finally decided to go to Philz coffee and walk back.   Of course as soon as everyone in my group came back  with the coffee, our name was called (over 1 hr) and we were told we could not bring the coffee inside.  What a waste of amazing coffee.  Wish they could put a big sign outside somewhere noting this rule.  Or they can maybe even offer their clientele coffee while they wait.  :) Hmm...this was wierd but I took a bite of my crawfish beignet and there was tissue paper inside the crawfish.  Really grossed me out but I have worked in restaurants and I was not going to make the biggest deal about it. Stuff happens!  I showed and told a waiter walking by and I kidd you not, he literally stopped, looked at the beignet and said..."oh wow, that is not good" and he walked away.  He had to help another table so I thought he was going to come back but he just walked passed me.  Umm hello??  So while I stared at my tissue paper I tried to flag down another waiter.  Someone finally came over and took my beignet away and bought me a new one.  It also turned out that the first waiter did tell the kitchen to get me a new beignet but never took the time to maybe come back, take it away and tell me he took care of the problem.  They are lucky that I am a pretty easy going customer.  Oh and they still put it on the bill.  Classy!!! Then the waitress gave my friend the wrong order.  When my friend told her that is not what she ordered, they insisted that she changed her mind and ordered what she got.  I was next to her and at no point did she change her mind.  It was kind of comical to watch because two different people tried to convince her she ordered the shrimp and grits when she actually ordered a sandwich.  Either way, everyone got their food and our tummies were full.  Oh but wait, my favorite moment was when we had barely paid our bill and the hostess came to our table and in a very not so polite tone asked us if there was anything else we needed.  Geez...I get it! Your busy but we were a party of 8 who ordered a lot of food and just give us a minute to breath will you.   Did not appreciate the pushing you out the door move right after you ate...really made a bad final impression.   Won't be rushing back to this roller coaster of an experience!!

Try to keep this short and sweet, Brenda is a must try!! the watermelon ice tea is the only beverage that me and girl friend would ever order, and did i mention that there are complimentary refills !?!?!  The beignet sampler plate was a good way for us to determine which beignet we will order and which to stay away from, but from what we've tasted, we would probably have to order the sampler again, because their all so uniquely delicious their own way !! Brenda now have a dinner menu !!

Want to get breakfast in the Tenderloin at 3 p.m.?  Sure.  What to get a great breakfast in the Tenderloin at 3 p.m.?  For sure.  And your friend wants vegan something for lunch and your other friend wants a burger?  Sounds like Denny's (if you leave out the "great" and the "vegan").  But it also makes for a sweet New Orleans-style (in looks and food) restaurant called Brenda's French Soul Food, huddled next to KFC on Polk Street.  I saw the opening night crowds (just a party because they don't stay open for dinner)), and I sure have seen the lunch crowds lined up out the door, so we went late today to beat the crowds.  Rolling in at 1:30 means that there's a spread of tables, and the food is great.  A few specials on the mirror (today, biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs and hash, a side of mac-and-cheese, and chicken-fried chicken), and then a compact menu with breakfast on one side and lunch on the other.  We ran the gamut, from french toast to an egg tartine to salad and a cup of gumbo (that was me).  I tasted the tartine and its accompanying biscuit (great biscuit and ditto on the egg dish), and my salad and gumbo were terrific, too.  For dessert, beignets and cafe au lait, cher.  The music was good too:  very New Orleans.  And they take credit cards.   So until 4 p.m., you can get your breakfast and NOLA fix here.  I really liked it.  (They promise shrimp-and-grits as a special now and again.  Hooray!)

I admit I only went here once so I feel kinda bad about giving them only 2 stars but based on the food, the service and the wait I aint going back again to reassess. Really the experience was one star or less so they should thank me for the extra star. I went here with my friend. We were up early so figured we would head over there before the breakfast rush. We got there earlyish and still had to wait 30 minutes. Annoying but doable. Eventually we get our table. No menus, we attempt to make eye contact with circling servers. No luck. My friend turns to get the attention of the server setting the table behind us. She tells him to wait because she is busy. She was rude.  So we continue to wait and now he's turning into a surly bitch. She finishes setting the empty table and deigns to talk to us. Now my friend is in full on bitch mode and she decides she is going to deal with it by being obnoxiously pretend helpful. So, I have condescending waitress on the one hand and bitchy soon to be ex boyfriend on the other. Ugh, they were both incredibly annoying. The beignets were overcooked and dry, the eggs were good. Nice and runny as I like them. The chicory coffee was disgusting. As I said earlier, I wont be back.

Craw fish beignets.. OMGGGGG they were delicious. One of those things I'll have to get everytime I go up to SF from now on. The food was pretty good and the staff worked efficiently with the space they had to work with. I would highly recommend coming to Brenda's but try and make it in early to beat the massive line.

Obviously by taking one look at this Yelp page you can see that Brenda's has a solid number of fans around.  My group went at 10am on a Sunday and had a fantastic time.  The wait was long...about 1.5hrs, but we did have a group of 5 on a Sunday at peak time.  The food was worth the wait though.  Our group started off by sharing the Flight of Beignets.  They had chocolate, apple, plain and crawfish versions and they were all great.  I went a little overboard (knowingly) and ordered the Hangtown Fry.  I was feeling daring and thought I'd give the crispy oysters a try.  It was a little too much for me personally, but I'm still giving this place a great review because I know people who really like oysters would love this and all the other food my group had was out of this world.  The grits other people had looked great.  Very buttery and very little traditional grits texture.  My personal favorite thing at the table was my girlfriends Fried Chicken Benedict.  It's pretty much just like it sounds and just as amazing as it sounds.  Last thing, the watermelon sweet tea, amazing.  The prices at Brenda's were very good for the city.  Definitely recommend Brenda's for brunch if you have the time to wait out the long line.

tiny canjun spot using quality ingredients and demonstrating nice execution of flavors. started with the gumbo (of course) nice smoky flavor and lean andouile sausage and okra throughout with a little scoop of rice to soak up the soup. for me it lacked the spiciness I like in gumbo but thank God for Louisiana Hot Sauce. the baked brie and spring greens salad was very much a winner as well. the baked brie was inside a square croissant like pastry. so layers of flaky French pastry shell surrounded the melted brie. wow! next up was the fried oyster PO boy sandwich. perfectly fried and not greasy. the oyster was tender and savory. served in a grilled french roll with a spicy cajun mayo. the pomme frites were fresh from the fryer too. the special dish of the day was also the best - the black eyed peas and rice with grilled andouille sausage. so smoky and tasty. i may become a regular here soon.

the only con about brenda's is that it's in the tenderloin--a block away from where we parked there was a brawl going down. this factor aside, i loved brenda's. the food was pretty authentic french/cajun. i got the shrimp pot pie, which was the special of the day and it was AMAZING! i also had the chocolate beignets and i was in heaven. their all you can drink watermelon iced tea is also fantastic and super refreshing. when i'm in SF, i'll for sure be back to this spot. next time, i'm getting the fried green tomatoes!

Brenda's knocked the ball out of the park with our brunch, yesterday.  Completely 5 star in every respect.  We were a total of three, so were able to broadly sample the menu, starting with the beignets (plain, and chocolate) followed by the oyster and bacon scramble, fried catfish poboy and last (and most orgasmic) the peach cobbler pancakes, which you simply can't refuse if they're on the specials board.  My friend said after one bite, "OooooH! THAT'S BETTER THAN A LOT OF THE SEX I'VE HAD."  The biscuits rank among the best any of us have ever had.  The scramble and poyboy sandwich equally zesty, flavorful and satisfying.  We didn't talk much at the table, which we all agree is a compliment to the chef.  We all want to go back, and Brenda's officially rises to the top of the list for where I'll take the next guests 'in - from -out - of - town".  And, it must be said, all the servers were friendly, fast and efficient.  Great experience!

Holy Moly! This place is the sh*t for ultimate comfort food! I had the chance to eat here back in May with my husband and team of photographers after we had our engagement session in Golden Gate Park. The line was long but since we're all foodies, we were all willing to wait. Just reading the menu was making us salivate already. We ordered beignet samples (delish!), catfish & grits special, and andouille & chedder omelet. Everything we had was good! It was comforting, filling, and it hit the spot. I loved the creamed biscuits and the grits too (wasn't really a grits fan till Brenda's)! I even tried the watermelon tea and it was refreshing and delicious. The service we had was actually good despite the mixed reviews here. The people were very nice to us and always coming by to refill our glasses with water or tea. Despite being such a very small and hectic restaurant, we definitely plan on coming back whenever we are in the area. As soon as we left, the song "Easy like Sunday Morning....." started playing in my head. That's when I knew my stomach was happy and my tastebuds were satisfied.

I expected even better after the other reviews but was definitely still impressed... five of us went together right before the Gay Pride Festival since Brenda's was nearby. Most of us tried omelette's including the two guys getting omelette's that had fried clams in them! I really liked mine with lots of veggies but the boys did not rave about the clams... The biscuits were delicious, yum! Also, I chose the potatoes while lots of others chose the grits. I loved my potatoes and liked the taste of grits too though they were almost too rich... The coffee was really yummy and the watermelon iced tea was unique but pretty good too. If you need to use the restroom, be CAREFUL! Most of us went to avoid porto potties later... you walk through the kitchen and the floor mats are so greasy that it's hard not to slip (in which case you'd hit the stove!)... anyways, great place to go for brunch just watch your step through the kitchen!

Don't go here, it's terrible and the hood is filled w/ crazy ppl and drug addicts.  Especially around 10 am on a Saturday for brunch.  Really.  My fiance didn't say it was the best coffee he had ever had, and the biscuits weren't wonderfly cakey on the inside but crunchy on the outside.  The staff wasn't wonderful and friendly and the food wasn't more interesting and flavorful than most fare.  Really, you should just go to IHop or Denny's for brunch.  Don't even BOTHER going here.  I will go for you, it will be my cross to bear.

It's a great place but you need to be early. When we got there on a Wednesday at 2pm there was 27 parties on the wait list. We went the next day at 8 something and it was a 3 minute wait but kinda sucks because we couldn't have the brunch food till 11am. The food was good but it wasn't what everyone was raving about. I think I would have been mad if i had waited the day before. The waiters are a bit busy  and not very personable. Overall I like the food and the ambiance. Take the biscuits over the toast.

Stopped by this place for Sunday brunch before heading back down to southern California. The place was packed! My friends and I had decided to wait since it had such good reviews already, and I think we all were glad that we waited the 30-40 minutes! The watermelon tea was AMAZING! I highly recommend it. The food here is also really good! I tried a little bit of everything (my friends and I all got different items).

Our wait for a table for two was about 30 minutes the day after Christmas. We ordered the beignet flight, hangtown fry and shrimp and goat cheese omelet. I agree with other reviewers that the beignets were more like fried bread as they were more dense than a donut but it worked for the savory crawfish beignet. The hangtown fry and shrimp omelet was only ok as the egg to filling ratio was too much. Parking was a breeze, but maybe because it was a weekday.  The neighborhood wasn't the best as a homeless guy was aggressively panhandling but in the daytime it isn't as scary. Overall it was ok but I definitely wouldn't wait over 30 minutes for the food at Brenda's.

One of the worst dining experiences Ive ever had. I went for lunch today, and the service was not only biased, but terrible. Unfortunately, like most San Francisco restaurants, certain tables/parties received much better service because of who they are. Becky was the server who made me so angry I didnt even finish the mediocre food. As a native New Orleanian, and former restaurant critic, I was very disappointed. The gumbo had that out the box taste with far too much rice. The Po-Boy was served on brick-hard bread with far fewer dressings than you'd find in New Orleans, and with far too much sauce. The fries were about as hot as melting ice. The watermelon tea is a great idea, but leaves much to be desired. The begniets dont even look like begniets and are much more like stuffed pan cakes. If the service had been better, I would have given it a second chance, however, I have no tolerance for biased service.

service is so sweet though after eating here several times, I've come to realize the food is not for me.  i don't feel healthy after eating at Brenda's and leave feeling nauseated.  the smell of crawfish, shrimp grits, fried catfish and watching people eating it- doesn't make for a relaxing sunday brunch.  I'm gagging just writing this.  their beignets are not the new orleans beignets I'm used to.  i like a lighter breakfast.

I came here 4-5 times for lunch.  There's always a line and the wait is long.  I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are an impatient person.  I have tried their famous shrimp and grit, fried chicken, fried shrimp po-boy sandwich, granola pancakes with fruits, and sweet tea.  I loved all of them but my favorite is their shrimp and grit.  I have never had grits before in my life before Brenda's.  However, Brenda's taught me that grits isn't just grits, they can actually be a very creamy delicacy when paired with the savory flavor of their infamous shrimp.  That's such a match made in heaven--don't you think?  Also, I love how the waiters refill the sweet tea! Can you believe it? All the sweet tea you can drink.  The only downside to this place is that it is located in the Tenderloin and very little parking.  Even though it is in the Tenderloin, it's not scary to wait because there's people also standing in line with you.  I'm not sure about dinner time because I have not been there during that hour of the day.

On Friday February 1st myself and 2 friends arrived at 11:30 for lunch.  The place was packed and we were seated at the bar area.  Our lunch orders were taken and drinks delivered.  Then we were forgotten.  After 30 minutes still no lunch arrived and by this time I noticed to my right there were 2 new diners at the bar that had ordered lunch and had gotten their lunch.  I also noticed in far corner a table of 2 arrived, placed their orders and their meal was served.  By 12:15 I spoke with my 2 friends and they too had witnessed this as well.  We all agreed to leave.  I stood up and got the owner / cooks attention that I would never be coming back.  She seemed surprised but made no effort to stop us or try to keep our business.  This was my 3rd time here but it will be my last.  I will not wait 45 minutes for lunch and I will not accept that others who arrived after me get their meals first.  This is a sure sign of a badly run kitchen.  No stars from me.  Your food may be good but your service sucks!!!

There was a lot of hype around the crayfish beignet, so I was very eager to try it. I was pretty disappointed. The crayfish inside didn't taste all that fresh. Overall, the filling flavor was kind of muddled. Nothing special. Bread had good seasoning and texture though. I imagine the sweet beignets would be really good - if I go back, I'd try those.  Gumbo was good too. I'd go back- but would just try the other stuff.

This place is off the chain.  I think the stars were aligned for me tonight.  I read a review in SF Weekly early in the day and a friend told me about this place in the afternoon.  Not wanting to f@#$ with fate I decided I better go.  Showed up about 8:30 on a Thursday night and while the place was packed we were immediately seated at the only remaining seats, a table for 2(fate?).  I started out with the Oysters Casino which were broiled with bacon, scallion and gruyere.  I mean oysters, bacon and cheese....how can you go wrong? They didn't go wrong, oysters were fantastic.  Next up Crawfish Beignets.  I could eat these all day long.  And finally for entree, the Shrimp & Grits were dank.  Honestly everything was perfect.  If anything I'd recommend not getting the oysters casino with the shrimp & grits just because they are similar tastes(both have bacon and cheese) but they were both delicious.  They don't have a liquor license yet so make sure to bring some wine (no corkage) if you're so inclined.  Total dinner bill for 2 with 25% tip?  50 bucks.  Solid!

This place is basically one big hype. I've had plenty of "soul food" in my lifetime and this is definitely NOT worth the 2-hour wait. We'd had the Eggs Benedict, Shrimp & Grits, and Fresh Toast and none of was too impressive. The French Toast should really be called Cream Cheese becaus with a pound of that in each slice, that's all you taste. And the "spicy fried catfish" in my Eggs Benedict was not flavorless and blah. In a nutshell, sloppy imitation of real soul food.

We came here early in the morning right when it opened so we could avoid the lines.  Beignets were alright, there weren't as light as I like.  The crawfish beignets were interesting, but I still prefer sweet rather than savory beignets.  The catfish eggs benedict were soo good as was the shrimp and grits.  Didn't get to try the catfish po'boy, but my mom really enjoyed it.  Watermelon iced tea wasn't as fruity tasting as I thought it could be, maybe the flavors need to meld longer since we were there when it just opened.  Overall, a good breakfast and would love to come back and try dinner or lunch.  I just don't know about waiting several hours to eat here.

Although we had to wait an hour to get in - it was TOTALLY worth it (partly because the weather was beautiful - 70 in November?!).  We started out with a flight of Beignets - plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish (my favorite!).  They were okay ... I mean, what can you really do to mess up or fancy up fried dough?  For our entrees my four friends all chose the Egg and Bacon Tartine (some with egg whites, some with the tomato bacon relish on the side, some traditional - all with a side of hash) and I chose one of the specials -- Shrimp with Grits and cheddar with tomato-bacon relish.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their meals but I ... I simply LOVED mine.  The grits should have been called cheddar with a side of grits - lots of cheese (part of the reason I loved the meal).  It was nice and spicy too - had a great Cajun sauce with a good portion of shrimp.  My friends were all disappointed they ordered coffee as they kept eyeing up the watermelon iced tea - I'm a purist ... had a glass of good ol' fashioned water.

I've been wanting to eat here for quite some time now and finally go tthe chance to have brunch here this past weekend.  We arrived around 930 and there were about 4 tables ahead of us... I would like to say the wait was about 20-30 minutes.  It wasnt that long but when you are hungry it feels like forever.  The service was very friendly throughout the entire visit.  We started off with the flight of beignets.  When we were eating it, we realized we got two chocolates instead of a crawfish but we just let it slide... but since we only ate half of each of the beignets, our server noticed that the crawfish was replaced with a chocolate so she put a crawfish one into our to-go bag.  The chocolate with the cayenne type powder on top was different but it actually wasn't that bad.  I decided to go with the Croque Monsieur for my entree and instead of fries I was offered potatoes which I took up on that offer.  The hubs had an omlette.  The portions were pretty big and everything was tasty.  I will definitely come back to try the eggs benedict on the biscuits... that looks way delicious and I was jealous of everyone ordering it after I had placed my order (haha).  I also had the infamous watermelon iced tea that was so refreshing especially on one of the hottest days this year so far. :)

I am definitely a fan of the food, but for me, to have a good dining experience means good service.  This is an area where Brenda's lacks.  All of the servers we interacted with seemed to have the attitude that, as customers, we were a burden on them.  No interaction, feedback on questions about the menu, delivery of food was slammed on the table as they quickly moved on...I couldn't figure out what was happening here, am I missing something.  Highlights included fried chicken, gumbo, salad with brie and the delicious red beans and rice.  I would definitely recommend for the food and atmosphere, but if you are also looking for decent service, steer clear.  You will probably be disappointed.

I had a decent meal here. I really liked the hot grits and the eggs Benedict special. The Andouille sausage was good too.  Pancakes good, fries good. Gumbo was really good. I would strongly recommend and outdoor awning and some outdoor seating to help accommodate the people having to wait outside. I would also recommend that people and people whose dogs defecate on the street be caned savagely like in Singapore. The streets in this area had a ridiculous amount of feces on them, those responsible are a health hazard and need severe corporal punishment. I will probably not be back due to having a year's worth of potential exposure to hepatitis due to the street feces and I saw a few cracked plates and mugs (cracked plates and glasses are a severe health risk). So I really liked the food, but I worried after eating there what I was exposed to. I travel a lot outside and across the US and find the condition of the tenderloin foul and outrageous. Price was very good, meal  was good, but I can't adjust to the environment.

Don't mind the 1 star...i'm trying to keep people away. REALLY good place for breakfast. It's cozy, for sure. I walked in and was surprised how small it was on the interior. Two of us got there just before 10 and we're glad we did. After we got there, the line grew at an alarming rate. When we left it was even longer. Helpful wait staff and delicious food. Everything looked good. I had the Peach Cobbler pancakes which were great. I also tried the veggie omlette and the beignets. Would definitely come back and try other things. Homemade buiscuits were good and the Eggs Benedict options looked great.

As transplants here from Texas, we have high expectations when it comes to Southern cooking. Brenda's food is delicious; it has been great everytime. The biscuits are perfect, the grits are too. The egg dishes are flavorful and cooked just right. The waiters are pretty tasty, too. And friendly and compitent. Well worth the wait.

I am sorry fellow Yelpers, I did not think as highly about Brenda's as my peers.  For me, it just didn't blow me away like the other 394 reviews said it would.  My date and I waited a little longer on Sunday morning, so we could get a table, and not the counter, which we were fine with.  The service was really great, and the place, although tiny inside, was clean.  My date complained that she had to walk through the kitchen -- where food is being prepared -- down a hallway..something.. to get to the bathroom, which she claimed felt a little unsanitary.  I didn't get up, so I don't know first hand...but anyway... I orderd the Gulf shrimp and goat cheese omelette- this was really the only item on the menu that appealed to me, and is solely the reason why I wanted to try Brenda's in the first place.  Everything else on the menu seemed so standard, and could be ordered at any breakfast place around, including Denny's.  I'll contend that I would've like to try the puff pastry things everyone's talking about.  My omelette came with potato hash and a biscuit.  Everything was good- just good.  Nothing wowed me.  The tomato bacon relish that came atop was interesting... although I felt I could've done without it.  I'm sorry Brenda's, but I probably won't be back anytime soon.

i've found my favorite brunch spot in the city! came with a friend on presidents' day. they don't take reservations but we didn't  have to wait too long before we were seated (i've waited longer for brunch at other places in sf). once inside, discovered a small, cozy and cute restaurant. everything looked so good that we ended up ordering more dishes than our table can hold (and more than we can eat). good thing we had a lot of catching up and 2.5 hours later, we cleaned off all the plates. i can't wait to go back for the pumpkin pancake special (this dish made my day), beignet flight, and gumbo again.

My taste buds are still filled with magical tasteeeee delight from the lunch I had here about a week ago. I split the shrimp poboy and the catfish poboy with a friend, since neither of us could decide on one or the other. I thought I would dig the catfish more, but the shrimp won out for both of us in the end. I had a few bites of a biscuit, and was ready to turn lesbian for Brenda! They had this cream cheese stuffed french toast with strawberry syrup on the menu that day, which I wish I was woman enough to handle because it sounds spectacular! We asked everyone what they ate who came out of the restaurant while we were waiting and everybody gushed about their food. The wait wasn't bad either, about 20 minutes for 3 of us to sit down; I think it's a little faster if you only have 2. My only complaint is I wish it were open on weekends when I actually have the time to go...it's a bit of a hike from my office, but if you work in the area or can get there during business hours you MUST MUST MUST go!

i got me some lunch here the last time i was in sf and it was such a treat.  my friends were raving about the new spot.  it's a quaint little spot.  i got the sloppy josephine and sweet watermelon tea.  all was divine.  i always think sloppy joe's are pretty boring but satisfying meals, but i must say brenda's does something special with it.  maybe it's the turkey or the potato bun.  try for yourself.  you won't be sorry.

if you see a line in front of this joint, it isn't because people are lined up for the double down at KFC next door.  we happened to have come here on a Friday morning and was able to get in without a long wait.   we ordered the beignet sampler, and thought the crawfish one was phenomenal.  the watermelon tea was interesting too.  i had the oyster egg omelette, which is something i've never had.  the grits that came with it was pretty amazing, but when i turned to look at the next table and they ordered the shrimp and grits, i was craving that.  next time...

I really wanted to love this place. Three friends and I waited for two hours this past labor day for a table. We knew the wait time was ridiculous but I had heard such good things and it was a lazy day off so we committed to the wait. The tiny place smelled delicious and I loved the look and feel of the restaurant. Unfortunately our waitress forgot to put our order in and we were well done with our mediocre bloody marys and onto our next drinks before she realized this. Again, lazy day off so we didn't get too cranky but when the food came it was just OK. I had the goat cheese, onion, and shrimp omelette the sauce is what made it. The potatoes were cold and just OK. Everyone else liked their food but agreed it just wasn't worth the wait. I really want to give this place another shot though (although my friends may never go back) and I plan on going early one weekend morning to avoid the crowds and get the kitchen and wait staff at the start of their day instead of the end of it.

Yes, the food was greasy and delicious.  But no matter how great your product is, it is not possible to run a successful establishment if you have bratty, clueless servers waiting tables.  Coming from someone who works at a very heavy customer service oriented and highly regarded SF restaurant, I can smell good service a mile away.  And even though this is a not a 4 star restaurant, you can't get away with asking me to move tables after I have already sat down for a different party just because they are complete.  You told me I could have this table so I am going to take it.  Also, if you cannot hear what my friend is ordering, politely ask her to speak up and SMILE.    This is your job, you have to at least act like you like it.  It is not acceptable to make jokes and roll your eyes.  To sum up- I liked the food but the service was spotty and almost rude.  I 'll go back but not because I know I will be taken care of service wise, but because that beignets were that good.

My co-worker and I came here for lunch today and Brenda brought her "A" game. Even on a Tuesday during lunch time there's a wait (ours was about 15 minutes), but it was expected and I'm sure my wait today wasn't nearly as painful as the wait for their weekend brunch. The space itself isn't what I expected for being in the 'Loin -- it's clean and modern. Moreover, once I walked through the doors and (1) saw the daily specials and (2) oogled other patrons' plates, I was excited to sit down and eat. Brenda didn't disappoint. I had the shrimp po' boy and of course stole some bites of my co-worker's shrimp and cheddar grits. YUM! One thing I will say is that I've had better beignets elsewhere (i.e., Bar Bambino and Spork) but maybe that's because I expect them to be lighter and Brenda's felt a bit heavy, dense and a little plain without the powdered sugar. Nevertheless, I was just here less than 8 hours ago but I'm already thinking that I want to go back there for lunch tomorrow.

I thought the food was quite decent and delicious. If you are a chocolate lover, I'd highly recommend the Chocolate Beignets. I have an issue with their service, we waited over an hour just to be seated. On top of that the table who sat down next to us ordered their food approx 10mins after ours was ordered. Low and behold they got their beignets before we did, finished their beignets and got their main entree. We sat and waited until I asked the waitstaff 'where is our food" It turns out, our waiter forgot our order and the food has been sitting underneath the heat lamp. It shouldn't take no more than 15mins to make banana fosters french toast and a omelet. All in all, because of the crappy service...the meal was marginal at best. It could have been a good meal, but I like to have my food as soon as the cook is done making it, not 20-30mins or however long it's been sitting underneath the heat lamp.

i never thought i would like it but i suggested it because i had friends that were in from out of town that i knew would love it.  we went for brunch on a monday morning and there was still a wait and it was well worth it.  i just had the eggs with some creamy yummy grits (i still dream about these today).  everyone else i was with had one of the specials and everyone was very happy with their meals.  we also ordered each of the different beignets and shared them with the table - great way to start brunch and you get to try them all!

Arrived at 10am on a Saturday and there was hardly a line.  The restaurant was cute and not over the top decorated with cheesy NOLA paraphernalia. (I lived in New Orleans and only the tourist places have beads hanging). I digress, started with cafe au lait for the table and a flight of beignets. The filled chocolate and apple beignets were the best. The regular beignet was not doughy and fluffy enough and I believe beignets are not a good medium for crawfish. Two of my friends ordered the andouille and cheese omelet which was a master piece. The omelet was more of an egg taco shell heaped with meat, cheese, and grilled veggies. I had the gumbo and biscuit. Both very authentic. My boyfriend had pumpkin bread French toast (special for the day) with caramel topping and espresso butter. It was amazing, very rich and full of butter but perfect. This was a nice little bit of NOLA in SF. I can't wait to try lunch there.

third time here and I love it. I lived in New Orleans for about 6 years and the food they serve is pretty close. The have remodeled since last time I was there and it looks really nice except now there is only one aisle to go down so it can get a little cramped once in a while. We got the plain benginets and they were delicious. It's a little thicker than the New Orleans ones but still good. I got the two egg any way with grits and a biscuit and bacon. I LOVE grits and those grits were such a nice texture of thick, smooth, and taste. The biscuit was also really good with just the right amount of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The bf got an order of pancakes and couldn't finish it because of how big they were. I love this place

I don't know about some of the people that have reviewed this place and didn't like it... either they have really bad taste buds or they are just hatin' on Brenda.  I thought this place was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in SF.  The crawfish beignets were DELICIOUS and next time I go, I'd probably just order that as an entree.  The oyster po boy and the shrimp po boy are both great.  Fuck people who think that they are "messy" to eat.  If it doesn't fall out all over the place, that means that there isn't enough inside the damn sandwich.  I'm also sick of hearing people say you could make this food in your own kitchen.  Go make it yourself then, fools.  The reason people go to restaurants like these is because they like home-cooked meals but don't feel like cooking.  Also, the watermelon iced tea is good as hell.  For the ones who think it's "too sweet"- go to Louisiana and have a sweet tea and tell me if you think Brenda's is still too sweet.  The teas and lemonades down there taste like syrup on ice and I still think they're good!!  Anyway, I love Brenda's.  If you are scared of the neighborhood because of what other scared ass reviewers mentioned, just give it a try... no one will mess with you unless you look paranoid.

The small, yet cozy restaurant is my new third favorite breakfast destination. My boyfriend was trying to find a new breakfast place to take me to, and went to yelp for help. Little did he know I was also reading and viewing all the raving reviews for Brenda's. I suggested come here for breakfast, and ruined his surprise for me. With that said ... we came here yesterday around 9. We expected a long line and difficult finding parking. But it was just the opposite ... the wait was only 15 minutes and we parked right in front of Brenda's. The food here is delicious! The house specialty sweet watermelon tea was a little too sweet for brunch, but great nonetheless. I had the creole veggie omlette with hash potatoes and whole wheat toast. The omlette was amazing from the first bite to the last. My boyfriend loved his egg and bacon tartine. I can't wait to come next time and try the beignets. =]

I had been meaning to give Brenda's a try for a couple years now, but my experience today has forever changed that. I innocently went in to ask how long the wait was, and now the snotty/rude man behind the register has made me forever associate Brenda's as the place that ruined my morning. Word of advice: if a customer is polite to you, don't answer simple questions in that manner. It is never too busy for good customer service.

Decided to go when co-workers who have been there before raved about some of the menu items. Line was out the door, which was expected. But our name was passed over twice for smaller groups (We had 4) to sit. They claimed they had a bigger table in the back, but it was actually the same size as two tables side by side which had been passed over for! The whole seating fiasco took about 25 minutes, which for an hour lunch break is too long. Then it took another 35 minutes for the food to come out. The wait staff was nice enough and offered several condolences, but I doubt we will ever go back. Especially not at lunch hour... The food was decently priced, not horrible tasting, but not good enough to undo the damage done by the wait time to sit and for the food to come out. There are too many other nice places to go for lunch around here where you don't have to literally sit elbow to elbow with the other patrons.

My friend and I were supposed to eat somewhere else for lunch today but the restaurant was unexpectedly closed. He had heard that Brenda's was a great place. Well...he heard right. We had to wait for about 45 minutes to sit down. It's a fairly small restaurant in tight quarters. There are so many interesting dishes on the menu, it was hard to chose. Decided to go for the Fried Oyster Po'Boy. It was delicious! Didn't eat all of the bread but my first bite was heavenly. Also ordered the Watermelon Iced Tea. Normally I don't order drinks with sugar in them but I honestly could only last the natural flavor of watermelon. The waitress said there's very little sugar in it. Also tried the Apple Cinnamon Beignet. They were good but had a little too much cinnamon for my taste. We were overall pleased with our meal. Going to take my husband there soon. The funkiest part of the restaurant is getting to the bathroom. You have to go through the VERY narrow and small kitchen. The staff are very accommodating about the situation though.

Brunch: shrimp and grits, watermelon iced tea, crawfish beignets (we got the beignet flight but really, all crawfish or plain beignets are the way to go.) They do not skimp on the cheese for the grits. Holla! Friendly service. Expect a lengthy wait. I hate waiting and wouldn't make this a regular stop, but the food its pretty delicious so it's still pretty much worth it to come back and try additional items.

The very first time we came to Brenda's, Brenda was in the kitchen cooking.  The crawfish beignet, shrimp n grits, banana foster's french toast, and shrimp po boy sandwich were yummy. The second time we came to this restaurant, I really wanted to go for the banana foster's french toast and crawfish beignets....And try something different, such as the catfish benedict.  To our surprise, Brenda wasnt cooking this time around and the beignets came out not fully cooked making the crawfish in the middle very cold and the beignet very doughy.  We sent them back..we were so turned off that we 86'd the entire order of beignets.  Then came out the banana foster's french toast...ehhhh it was not as good as Brenda would make it.  The catfish benedict was soaked with sauce and the shrimp n goat cheese omelet...the shrimp was overcooked and too much goat cheese in it. Yuck!  What a disappointment from our first visit.  All that waiting (45 minutes) just to get disappointed!  Arghhhh!  If you want to eat here, make sure Brenda is in the kitchen cooking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Brenda's French Soul Food is a charming little fusion place on Polk.  I can honestly say walking in I did not think the food itself sounded appetizing, but the fact that there was a consistent wait every time I passed by piqued my curiosity.  I decided to try the place with a friend who was visiting San Francisco; to sum up the place I'll quote my friend (formerly a Bay Area resident): "This is why I miss San Francisco."  The food is very creative, borrowing from France and down home soul food (duh).  You might not think it would work, but you gotta give it a shot and see for yourself.  I had a special that day, pumpkin bread french toast and it was delicious!  They paired with a ginger butter so as not to overwhelm with sweetness.  The beignet flight (are you kidding, beignet flight??) was amaaazing.  Ghirardelli beignet along with a crawfish beignet.  That biz is the preakness.  Come here for brunch.  The owner is usually on staff and always loves newbies.

line is long, duh. we put our name down, walked to the farmers market, went to the library, went BACK to our apartment and got a sweater and then came back. they had already called our names, but the host was cool and sat us next anyway. the food was bomb, the beignets amazing, service awesome. watermelon iced tea was good - it's almost better that they don't have a liquor license so people don't linger too long. it's such a small place but thats it's what makes it a gem.

This place is incredible! My husband and I tried it on a Saturday morning in January (just now getting around to reviewing it though). When we got there at 10 am it was raining and cold, yet a huge group of people were huddled under newspapers, umbrellas, and coats waiting outside. After getting our names on the list, we started looking at the menu (and gazing longingly through the window at peoples plates) and started planning our attack. 45 min. later... we were seated inside the warm, cozy dining room and proceeded to order enought for ten people. We planned to take most of it home after sampling it all, but in the end left with only 2 to-go boxes. Shameful I know! But it was too good to resist!! What we ordered/ devoured: Chocolate beignets- hot crispy outside/ tender inside filled with hot molten chocolate... to DIE for! Instantly made the 45 min. wait totally worth it! Granny Smith apple beignets- stuffed with crunchy apple chunks covered in cinnamon honey butter... tasty but a bit too crunchy and sweet for my taste. Plus we had them ofter the chocolate ones so they couldn't compete. Gingerbread pancakes with ginger butter- holiday special... yum! Christmas in your mouth, moist and delicious! French toast- Amazing soft bread, full of flavor, dripping in the most incredible butter pecan syrup you'll ever eat... the breakfast version of pecan pie! Croque Monsieur: a fancy ham and cheese sourdough sandwich with a pile of fries... hubby loved its dripping in cheesy-goodness! Regretfully we didn't order the watermelon sweet tea- which everyone else in the place was drinking, or the gumbo or eggs benedict... those were the most popular dishes leaving the kitchen besides the beignets... but we will surely be back to take advantage of them in the near future!

So I'm leaving San Fran in a few hours and I thought hey why not eat Brenda's before I go? I called my order in which was the Hangtown fry which is pretty much egg, scallion, bacon and oysters. It also comes with your choice of hash browns or grits and a biscuit or toast. I walked the half mile there and it was pretty crowded. The lady there ran my card and just walked away like an ass hole. So I took the receipt and signed it and left. The hangtown fry was okay but  I should've ordered egg whites, there was wayy too much egg here. After eating half of it I remembered my grits! Of course there aren't here so I ate my biscuit to help me feel better lol and they do have the best biscuits ever. This is the real reason why I came back. I don't think i'll be back for breakfast here I'll just stick to lunch. My breakfast including my 2 beignets i got came out to $16.43. Next time I'll just go to Sam's diner across the street from my hotel like I've been doing.

Holy moly--the French toast with warm butter pecan sauce was AMAZING.  The first bite put me into brown sugary, butter pecan heaven and it never let up.  I was totally in my happy place.  And if that weren't enough, the biscuits there were also awesome:  light, flaky, tender--not sweet or doughy like so many biscuits in the West--but real Southern biscuits.  What a find!  We also ordered the flight of beignets.  The crawfish one was fantastic--perfectly seasoned with the right amount of spicy heat.  The others were good, too, except the apple one seemed a little overwhelmed by its spices.  Skip the molasses ham--the texture felt processed.  Oh yeah--the watermelon iced tea is delicious and refreshing, similar to an agua fresca, but with tea.  Tiny little place with a max capacity of 40, although I couldn't tell you where that many could actually sit!  Awesome experience overall.  Take quarters for the meters.

Finally, I try the famed Brenda's, and there was almost no wait on this Saturday morning at 9:10am (you snooze, you lose!).   We had a flight of beignets ($8) to start... one chocolate, one apple, one plain, and one creole stuffed beignet, which looked more like little loaves of bread rather than a french doughnut.  But true to form, they were not too dense, or greasy.   I got the creole veggie omelet (egg white = $0.75 more), which was served with the best grits I have ever had in my life! It was a buttery (the pool of butter was easily mopped up with a towel), and kinda corn-y (did they put some corn meal in it?).... very savory and tasty. Also tried the watermelon iced tea, which kinda tastes like ice tea + blended watermelon puree; sweet but not too sweet.   All 4 of us cost a total of $60.  The only downside is that I felt like I was going to have a heart attack after all the heavy food... :P Better go to the gym...

Yes, there's a line.  But that is because the food is sooooo good.  It's like a tiny slice of New Orleans heaven in there.  The crawfish beignet I dreamed about for days afterward, and the grits were some of the best I've ever had-- and I used to spend all my summers in Louisiana, so I've had a lot of grits.  Do your tummy a favor and eat at Brenda's.

before i got to brenda's i had no idea what a beignet was. as i had more than enough time to examine the menu during the wait for our table (1.3 hours) i read a description and quickly decided i wouldn't like one and that i especially wouldn't like a crawfish one (it sounded more appropriate with something sweet, not savory). however, someone at my table ended up getting several of crawfish beignets to share and i was proven completely wrong - they are amazing!!! while my meal was delicious (fried fish benedict) as well as all the bites of dishes of my dining companions, i will be back specifically for the crawfish beignets! 1 star off for the horrid wait...

FYI: This is not my first time ordering from this place. I ordered 3 beignets over the phone (like usual) and went there to pick them up. When I got there, they charged me $22.76 for 3 orders of beignets. I thought their price went up to $7.00 each but they actually charged me for 9 beignets (1 order = 3 beignets). Their website never said anything about this, I only see the price for 1 beignet = $2.50. I tried to reason with the hostess but he rudely told me that he couldn't do anything and that next time I should say 3 pieces on the phone. My friend was there and she did not want to make a scene so she went ahead and pay for the incorrect order. When we finally eat the beignets, they were so fishy and left a really fishy after taste. My other friends started to have tummy issues after eating 1 beignet.  I will never go back to this place again. Thank you Brenda's for a really dissapointing meal & service.... -_-

i've been meaning to try Brenda's for awhile now, as it's only a block from where i work, but every time i try...it's packed and the wait is at least 30 minutes.  they say that you can do take-out, but i found out after eating that they only do it when it's not busy...and that's basically like never. it's hella outta place.  sandwiched between a taco bell (see my review) and an auto body place, you would think the owner was on crack when they chose this place.  but after finally getting to eat there at lunch today, i'm glad they chose this spot so close to my work. we got there and noticed what looked like a wait list outside, and seeing that there was an open spot along the wall, we walked right in.  we noticed that the two people working the tables never came by us...i had to ask one of them if i could see a menu before he told me "you have to put your name on the wait list" first.  it wasn't bad though, maybe a 10 minute wait. it's a small place, maybe 20-25 people max.  they have a regular menu, and they have specials on a chalkboard sign outside.   i was lucky to be joined by ms. jillian, who doesn't know that's she going to be my new food buddy, and i'm gonna start taking her on lunchtime adventures to new restaurants in the area. i wanted to try the beignets, since i hadn't had any since i was a kid.  we got the beignets flight, which is basically a beignet sampler (4 beignets - plain, chocolate filled, apple & maple filled, and one crayfish)  i never had a savory beignet, such as the crayfish, and i was eager to try it.  we went from right to left with the crayfish one last.  we both agreed that the plain one was good.  the chocolate was up next and the girl says it was good, i thought it was a little too sweet, the apple & maple one was better than the chocolate i thought, and before we got to try the crayfish, out entrees were served, so i had the crayfish beignet boxed up.  we both had the fried oyster po' boy, which came with a shitload of fries and pickle chips.  the po 'boy came on a french roll, and the oyster was seasoned and fried nicely, the sauce on the oyster was a chipotle remoulade, and it complemented the the crunchy oyster with a spicy creaminess.  mmmmm good! i'm going back tomorrow to try the hangtown fry (deep fried oyster, bacon, eggs). service was good, although i got the feeling that maybe because i was n't dressed in a suit & tie and the girl didn't have a dress on, they looked down on us...but after we ordered, service was perfect for me. definitely a must try when you're in the area. p.s. - i just learned that the head chef is half creole/half filipino...coolness!

Tried Brenda's for the first time last Friday. This is a very small establishment, expect to wait unless you get lucky.  We went for lunch, a party of 4.  Although my companions loved their food which included peach cobbler pancakes, thick pancakes, with lots of peaches, shrimp po boy (cooked to perfection) , my experience  with the savory bread pudding with andouille sausage, was not quite up to theirs. The dish was slightly warm, not brought hot to the table and pretty darn sweet. Then again what was I thinking when ordering bread pudding, should have expected sweet.  I was looking forward to the coffee (which was good not great),which is served in large oversize cups.  I will note that  the waiter never returned to re-fill water or coffee.  The neighborhood is not the best, but not too bad during the daytime.  Prices are quite reasonable with most items runnnig about $9-10. So altho my companions gave it a 4.5 star average, it only gets a 3 star review from me.

It is no surprise that this place is full of people with a line out the door on a Tuesday afternoon.  The food here is absolutely phenomenal.  First the flight of beignets (granny smith apple, chocolate, plain and crawfish) was really good--doughier than I thought they would be but I don't have anything to compare it with.  But they were popular since everyone inside the place ordered them.  The coffee with chicory was very good-- deep, rich and slightly spicy.  I ordered the Hangtown Fry special with grits and a biscuit.  If they didn't give me so much food, I would have licked my plate clean.  The oysters and eggs were perfectly cooked.  The grits were smooth and creamy and the biscuit moist and fluffy.  What makes this place even better is that the prices are not expensive--- $8 for 4 beignets and $11 for my dish.  The only downside was we ended up sitting at the bar in front of a large mirror--but we did hear the greatest "grandfather coming out of the closet" story from Trevor sitting next to us.

Not being from this area we naively just got in back of the line waiting outside of Brenda's for breakfast. Luckily a nice lady in front of me whispered to me that we needed to make sure we put our names on the list. We got in a a short period of time and ordered the granola pancakes, fuji apple pancakes (today's special), and a flight of beignets to go because we were too stuffed to eat them there. The granola pancakes were amazingly good and crunchy. The fuji apply pancakes were just okay, and it was kinda weird that they were just pancakes with apples on top. So they were really apple pancakes, just pancakes topped with apples. The sauce on those pancakes was yummy though. The beignets are truly excellent and we will have to return to get those to go even if we cannot wait for a table. The service was great and overall, I would love to come back.

Brenda's is one my favorite restaurants in San Francisco. I have been here so many times I have lost count. There is definitely a long wait time but i must say it is worth the wait. While you wait take a look at the menu and decide what you will have so you don't waste anymore time. Okay now lets talk about the delicious scrumptious food that will leave your taste buds in heaven and your belly full. Brenda's offers 4 different types of beignets but I highly recommend the chocolate & crawfish flavors. If you would like to try each of the 4 different flavors then order the Beignet Flight. We have enjoyed the Hangtown Fry ( my mothers favorite), the Shrimp & Grits( me and my sisters favorite), the Shrimp & Goat Cheese omelet, the bananas foster french toast (this one is to die for), shrimp po'boy ,sweet watermelon house tea. Everything that I have tasted here is amazing. I am never disappointed. Every trip to this place is exceptional. If i had to walk to this place from Sacramento I would....am i exaggerating? maybe just a little, but please believe this place is EXCELLENT.

Prepare to wait, and this is not an over-statement.  I went this Saturday after reading the reviews and no joke, it was 45 mins, just for 2 people and that was for the bar.  So we get in, get seated and order.  I had the craw-fish beginets and I thought it was just one, yet it was 3.  And they were huge.  Delicious, yet a bit to much dough for my taste, I am use to them not a doughy.  Along with that I had a cup, which was plenty, of the gumbo.  Good, the rice was super al dente, which I personally do not like, and it needed salt.  Although picky, I feel that you should know what you are in for.  The strawberry preserve appeared to be home made, which is always a plus.  My brunch date had the tartine with bacon and cheese.  I thought this was top notch and the grits that came with were buttery and delicious.  I vote to make the effort to go.  2 things, bring tons of change if you do not walk and or park in the garage as the parking meters are running on Saturday.  Second, get coffee as you wait, it will be a while.  And as a side note, I do not know if they have a restroom.  I have no idea where it would be as this is a tight spot.

I finally got a chance to try Brenda's and it didn't disappoint.  The hardest thing is deciding what to order.  When you glance around at what others are eating everything looks so good.  I tried the shrimp poboy.  It was delicious.  The bread was super light and the shrimp was perfectly battered and not greasy at all.  And the fries!!  They are also not greasy, thin cut and super good.  I need to go with more people so I can try the beignets.  The watermelon iced tea is delicious and they offer refills.  My only complaint is that the service is slow and a little to casual.  The food is slow to come (which I can understand because the kitchen looks tiny) and a man 3 seats down the counter got my food by accident and it took them forever to see to him and make the switch.  Overall, a fabulous addition to the breakfast/lunch  scene.  Also, only go with a couple of people...this place is tiny.

So good.  We came at 2pm for a late Sat brunch, and even those Brenda's closes at 3pm, we still had to wait a few minutes for a table, and the place was consistently full right up until we left at 3:30pm.   The hands-down favorite among my group was the gumbo - so rich and full of flavor, and I was a happy woman every time I tasted a morsel of chicken or chorizo.  Second favorite was the delicious Hangtown Fry - one of the daily specials, which was an egg scramble with oysters and bacon.  Honestly, how could that not have been good?  I wanted to try the croque monsieur because it was highly recommended and one of the specialties, and although it was good, it somehow wasn't quite as satisfying as the egg scramble or gumbo, partially probably because the flavor wasn't as strong.  Same goes for the crawfish beignet, which although good, just didn't hit the spot yesterday.  The texture of the beignet was right on, though - just the right denseness and texture.  I wish Brenda's wasn't located smack dab in the TL - can't wait to go back for more gumbo!

We had brunch there last Sunday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The food was amazing!  I'm originally from Lousiana and have been dying to find good cajun/southern food in the bay area.  I love this place.  I love how they put a new twist on southern favorites.  We had the flight of beignets.  The Crawfish Beignets were my favorite.  We also had the Catfish Benedict, Hangtown Fry, and the Banana Foster French Toast.  All delish!  We waited an hour but well worth the wait.  The staff were very friendly which also made our experience so much more enjoyable.

We had high expectations for Brenda's based on all the rave reviews and unfortunately, these expectations were not met. Brenda's would be an easy to miss hole in the wall, if not for the huge crowd waiting outside the restaurant. Our party of 4 got there at around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated at around 2:30. That's a pretty long wait but not excruciating- in some cases, a long wait actually helps because the hungrier you are, the better food tastes. In the case of Brenda's, not so much. We got the assorted Beignets and though they were good, they were quite doughy with a small portion of filling that didn't meet expectations. We each ordered a variety of entrees: french toast, beef grillades and grits, the scrambled egg and fried oysters, and the sausage omelet. We are all breakfast lovers, but none of the dishes were anything to write home about. The food was decent enough but not decent enough to meet our expectations and 1 hour wait.

I've been dying to try this place for quite some time so needless to say my expectations were high given such great reviews its received.  We started our breakfast off with an order of plain and crawfish beignets.  We both thought there were a bit too heavy and doughy.  Hubby had the bacon oyster scramble and I've got to admit, his dish was good.  The oysters were awesome.  I had the catfish benedict with cheesy grits.  I wasnt pleased with my dish because it was served on a dense heavy biscuit.  Surprisingly, the major highlight to my meal was the cheesy grits. I'll return to Brendas for the grits alone. This place gets super packed, be prepared for at least 30 min wait.

Labor Day was initiated with Shag and Sham in a very divine manner by taking the 29 up to the TL to imbibe the amazing NOLA cuisine here.  We got to this lil joint around 10am and had about a half hour wait before we were seated.  No worries, we can always talk about how amazing NOLA and having conversations with accents in our heads and out loud with ourselves is, to entertain us for timepass.  When we were seated, I already knew I wanted the special of sweet potato pancakes topped with candied walnuts, syrup and cream, along with a bombass cup of joe with chickory.  OH MY GOD! Sorry I don't use caps often, but this place is definitely deserving of them.  I had one of Shag's chocolate beignets, and it was yummy.  And then I had some of her buttery grits.  Then I tasted the coffee, and it was also yummy (not too strong or stale or cold).  And then the main course of the pancakes came and I died in my own bliss.  The end.

This place is wonderful. I showed up on a Tuesday at 12:00 with five of my friends and we got a table within 10 minutes, so there was no problem at all with the wait. The service was outstanding. We had a really nice male waiter who winked and smiled a lot, hehe. So we all shared one order of crawfish beignets and the Granny Smith apple beignets (each had 3 beignets per plate). Then, my friend and I split the granola pancakes and the shrimp and goat cheese omelette. The pancakes were awesome, as the granola made them kind of crispy.. great texture and flavor. The omelette had a really good, light, moist texture, although it could have had more shrimp. The best part about the omelette was that it came with a delicious SUPER buttery biscuit on the side and some grits. Did the grits have parmesan in them or something? sooooooo delicious. The only other grits I have ever had are at a college dining hall and Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.. Brenda's blows them out of the water. Also, the watermelon tea is like sticking a straw into a watermelon and slurping. SO REFRESHING!!!!!! I can't wait to go back.

Oof! This place makes me full just to think about it. We got really lucky and only had to wait about 7 minutes to get a table. Everyone was kind and everything was delicious! We started out with some granny apple beignets. We thought we were just getting one and were surprised to see three on our plate. They are so delicious! Although I was peeking around the room and it looks like all the beignets are delicious. You might want to get one of the flights, with one of each. And for food? I went with the sweet potato pancakes with a butter pecan sauce. Wow! Sweet, filling, delicious and rich! I could barely finish one of them after the beignets. Boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict with fried catfish on homemade biscuits. Those biscuits! Very tasty. I would say he won at ordering at this place. Next time, I want to try that watermelon iced tea!

as i approached the place on foot, i immediately knew i had arrived solely on the crowd queued up outside.  showed up at 9:45am with a smile on a saturday, after hearing all the talk about this place through all things social media.     my excitement and anticipation grew heavier and heavier as i approached the front and was told of the 2hr wait.  ok, fine.  any place with a 2hr wait, has bound to be good, right?   i was in for a surprise. finally was seated and ordered the Hangtown Fry, and sampled the Catfish Eggs Benedict. Hangtown Fry - oysters were slimy and were not fresh and tasty.  were they supposed to be "crispy" and fried as per the menu?  apparently mine's weren't.  the combination of oysters and scrambed eggs was not a pleasant taste for a first meal of the day.  this may be a traditional soul dish, but was i was not diggin' it at all.  only thing that was good on this dish was the grits.  grits, for crying out loud!! Catfish Eggs Benedict - biscuits were decently very dry.  eggs and sauce were bland.  catfish (the most important part of the dish, may i add) tasted chewy and stale.  think popeye's but 5 hours old and then refried for 1 minute, then served. Overall, i wasn't impressed and will not come back here.  did i come on the wrong day based on all the good things i've heard about Brenda's?  if the wait wasn't so long, i may be enticed to come back and try other menu items.  but from the looks of it, that might not be happening anytime soon.

This was our first time at Brenda's.  We ordered the sample platter of beignets, the Grillades and Grits, bowl of gumbo and coffee. Didn't taste too much chickory in the coffee,  the chocolate beignets were awsome, the plain ones didn't taste much like the ones in Nawlins', the Grillades and Grits were to die for and the biscuit that it comes with, and the gumbo was good but on the salty side.  We definitely would come again and early since a big wait started to form outside.  Downside is that it's metered parking all around so bring your coins with you.  We will definitely come back!

Went here for lunch and on the way there from what I've heard and seen I was expecting there to be a line outside the door. It was just before 12 and I was surprised not to see a single soul out side the door waiting. Table seating was all but there were 2 spots at the counter but saw that some folks were finishing up and waited for less then 10 minutes. Like almost everyone has commented - this place is small. We were seated at the table up against wall and I sat on the outside. It wasn't annoying but I got nudged every time someone walked by. I had the shrimp poi-boy and the wife had the jambalaya. We also got a sampler of beignets. The sampler alone was one dish. Just because it's a sampler plate does not mean their the size of donut holes. Out of all of them (Plain, Chocolate, Apple, Crawfish(had barely any filling)) I liked the plain the best. It was like a tiffany donut. My sandwich was really good, it was actually the first poi-boy I've ever had so I can't compare it to any other but as a sandwich, it was pretty darn tasta! Jambalaya could have been more flavorful but still good.  Will definitely go back for another sandwich or for breakfast.

Based on yelper reviews, I decided to try Brenda's.  I decided to walk by after having breakfast at farm:table, and after reviewing the menu and observing the patrons, I decided I had to try it.  Came here Saturday right before it opened, so no wait.  I sat at the counter and felt overwhelmed by the choices.  Should I try the catfish benedict?  shrimp and grits?  french toast?  In the end, the beignet sampler won out.  I guess I should have asked how big before I ordered a side of molasses ham!  The beignets came out steaming hot, crispy and NOT greasy.  I could only eat the plain and crawfish, saving the apple and chocolate for later.  (Actually, I only got a bite.  My son ended up wolfing them down later that morning.)  The cafe au lait was wonderful.  But the real hidden gem was the homemade peach jam that they serve.  I loved that!  Really a satisfying breakfast.  I definitely want to come again to try Brenda's other offerings.

Walk up, put your name on the list and wait.  We got their around 9am on Sunday and had a 15 minute wait but I hear it can be longer so just be prepared BUT DON'T LEAVE. The group in front of us had six people but was smart and broke up into two groups of three. This place is small but the food was incredible.  I had the French toast topped with powdered sugar and added the warm, buttery toasted pecan sauce for a buck extra.  In the restaurant business it's simple; provide great food, friendly quick service, and reasonable prices.  I give it 5 stars because they GET IT.

Similar to Mama's in that the food is great but unless you come right before they open to about 20 minutes after they open, you are going to have to wait an hour. Also, although the decor is nice the tables are so close together that I was uncomfortable and chose to get take-out. I wouldn't wait an hour to eat anywhere including here or Mama's.

What to say about Brenda's? I love it. Of course there are already tons of rave reviews here, but after going, you just want to express how much you like this place. I love that it is so super tiny. You feel like you're in a home kitchen. In fact, the kitchen nearly spills out into the dining room. Brenda is right there cooking up a storm. And if you dare to go to the bathroom - you have to walk through the kitchen and all the staff yell and warn Brenda that someone is coming through! How this place got so jam packed popular is a mystery to me. Maybe it's all down to Yelp, because I doubt she has to do much advertising and I you would just pass it up if you walked by it. Unless of course, it's one of those days where there is a massive line out front. And, of course, the food is slamming good. The beignets are to die for. I've had the original and the granny smith apple and they are delish. In fact, I think it would be great to just get some of those to go. Yes, you will have to wait. But it is so worth it. Go around the block to Peet's coffee to starve off your hangover hunger for a bit while you wait. You'll be glad you did. Oh, and you can bring in your own wine/champs etc. Mimosas anyone? I haven't done it yet, but I was tempted on New Year's Day. There are always specials and on NYD she served a special dish of black eyes peas. While I chose to go with eggs and bacon, that sure did look mighty fine. I also wanted to try the pumpkin bread French toast. Doesn't it make you salivate just thinking about it? If you live in the hood - Upper Tenderloin, Lower Nob Hill, Civic Center or just the TL, this is a must. Go Brenda! You're my hero.

it was just yesterday that me and my lady had figured out we would try this french soul food joint.  she had just gotten off work and i was due at work any minute.  we hoofed it from union all the way to the tl.  there was a line, but it moved very quickly and we sat down.  we ordered the donut thingys, my favorite were the crayfish, the watermelon tea, which was alright but only because i am not one for watermelon juice.  just as were finishing up our donuts they brought out our main course, she had gotten a veggie omelet with hash and a biscuit, and i got the eggs benedict.  WOW it was worth the walk, the wait and everything else in between.  the biscuits are freaking fluffy and soooo tasty not to mention the strawberry jam they had.  everything else was good, go there.  only problem, a little pricey but not bad considering it is the city.

Ok, here's the thing with this place, DO NOT GO IN PARTIES OF 3. this place is sooooooo small that they literally have tables designated for the amount of people in your party to insure that every seat is full every minute they are open, which from a business stand point is genius but when ur the party of three waiting out side for 3 hours watching people who just got there get seated before you, IT SUCKS. I was in SF 2 weeks ago and ate here sat/sun and it was unreal. I had the shrimp/goat cheese omelet and the pecan french toast and i am salivating just reminiscing on the flavor. The sh***y part, we were a party of three and it took 3 hours to be seated. Apparently, there is only one table for parties of three, and God forbid they seat you at a table for 4 and have an empty seat...other than that its great. Oh, and i cant remember the brand of coffee they have but its the best damn coffee I've ever had.

incredible.  the only places better that i can think of for breakfast are dozens in denver and my all time favorite, sabrina's in philly.  not to say that brenda's doesn't go pound for pound with them.   had the catfish benedict, steak and gritz thing and some donut things.  sorry, i can't remember the names for some reason but you can find them in the other amazing reviews.   i love this place.  this is truly good food that anyone can appreciate.  the best drink ever is here i'm convinced:  watermelon iced tea.  and the refills just keep coming.   the line is pretty long, but it's definitely worth it.  i waited as long at mama's and i wasn't that impressed.   the best part is that htis place is so reasonably priced.  about 10 bucks or under per entree.  do yourself a favor if you're in sf or visiting and get down to brenda's.  i'm already planning my visit back.

OK, we had heard that the food at Brenda's was BIG, so neither of us had eaten and we were starving by the time we were seated for lunch.  We started with the beignet flight - wow!  WOW!  Apple, chocolate, plain, and crayfish - delicious.  For a main course I had the hangtown fry scramble with biscuits (amazing, even after all of the beignets) and grits (oops, I had ordered hash, but since I didn't have room for either no big deal).  Even though the tiny space was packed the waitress didn't rush to turn the table and allowed us to linger and chat (and digest!).  My new favorite breakfast spot in the City.

5 Stars! 5 stars! 5 Stars! After 27 years of searching I have finally found the Holy Grail of all Breakfast/Brunch places. Brendas! Brendas! Brendas! Where have you been all my life? I finally came here with my girlfriend and waited an hour to get seated. As we were waiting I was thinking to myself of how I always hate waiting in line for 1-2 hours to try all these good breakfast/brunch places people yelp and see on the Food network. I have gone and tried most of the top breakfast/brunch places and only one stood out which was MaMas and I still thought to myself It was not worth waiting in line for an hour UNTIL NOW. So we finally got seated and both of us knew what we were going to order. I ordered the Egg and Bacon Tartine & my girl ordered the special eggs benedict with deep fried catfish. We each also ordered the Sweet Watermelon Iced tea. Let me just say this everything was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. I also loved how you get free refills on the iced tea. We really wanted to order the Beignets but didnt because we were too full. We heard it was really good. Why I gave this place 5 stars was because 1. You could write your name down and kind of guess how long the wait is going to be, walk around and come back to be seated (unlike a lot of places where you have to wait in line). 2. The food is unbelievably amazing. 3. Free refills on the watermelon iced tea. 4. Great service. 5. Affordable great prices. those were my 5 reasons Why I gave this place 5 stars. I could not stop thinking about this place all day since we left here and no other restaurant has ever done this to me except for Gary Danko. I will definitely come back here real real soon.

A tiny and popular breakfast spot featuring substantial Southern breakfasts. It's even crowded the morning after Tgiving (as if Tgiving didn't fill you up enough!) and the place was packed by 8:20. Not the most kidcentric (but they have 1 high chair) because its so small but we managed. Shrimp and grits and their sweet watermelon tea is what i recommend...makes the place different than other brunch places (I'm personally not a big going-out for breakfast person...we can make most of it at home :)). I prefer the delicate pillow beignets from Just For You better (just make sure they're fully cooked, they weren't the last time we went) than the sturdy ones here...though the crawfish one and apple ones have good flavor. Interested to check out their gumbo!

TWO hour wait (granted that I got here at 11:30 on a Sunday...definitely prime time brunch rush). The seating area of the restaurant is small, only seats about 44 people. But other than that.....you MUST try this place. I can't even start raving about how delicious it was. This is a restaurant you have to taste to believe what all the great reviews it's getting.

With most brunch spots you should expect a wait but it wasn't too bad for our table of five which was good. The beignets were huge! We shared one order and couldn't even finish them. The main dishes were also sizeable. Everyone enjoyed the food... I had the shrimp and goat cheese omelet with Cheddar grits and a biscuit. I honestly only had a few bites of the grits and didn't even try the biscuit. There should have been half size portions!! Now... the host was a nice guy. The lady who appeared to maybe be the manager was cheerful as well. Our server - Rachel - was rude. She literally would halfheartedly ask if we needed anything but wouldn't wait for the answer. If one person said coffee she'd turn around and leave.... like did you hear the request or did you just rudely walk away from us??? She literally came to the table with the check, put it down, then asked if we needed anything... like shouldn't u ask BEFORE putting the check down?? Then when someone asked for coffee it was like she was pissed. She snatched the bill and crumpled it up in front of us then walked away. Huh??? Who messed up ur morning? Not us so stop being stank. If I head back to SF yeah I'd go back to Brenda's but I would publicly and explicitly request not to have Rachel as my server. FYI, she's the one with big curly hair... I'm just saying...

Is it authentic?  I don't know.  Is it good?  Heck yeah!  But don't go on an empty stomach.  The line is long and you'll be sooo hungry by the time you sit down (an hour wait on a Monday!).  Also don't go if you're not hungry at all.  The portions are a good size (read: stuffed at the end!), and you'll need to have room for the biscuit, oh-so-yummy and just the right amount of moist and flaky.  I had the black-eyed peas and andouille sausage dish, one of the specials of the day, and it was fantastic.  Gumbo was so-so...kind of salty for my taste.  Table of 4 also shared the flight of beignets at the end -- yum!  I'm a vanilla person by nature, so I liked the plain and chocolate filled ones the best, but the others really liked the crawfish beignet.  I'll be back soon, to try the sandwiches.  Can't wait!

I must have gained 5lb after eating here. The beignets were excellent. We tried the flight and they were all delicious, the dough was soft and the fillings were super rich. The watermelon iced tea was refreshing, esp. after waiting for 30 minutes. I can't remember what else we ordered because we were already in food coma after the beignets.. but I know the food was all great and we needed to go to the gym after.

I spent 5 wonderfull, well fed years living in New Orleans, so I can authoritatively say that this place cooks up some good soul food.  There's usually a wait, especially on weekends, but it's wroth it.  I should mention that I hate to wait, waiting is for the suckers at the end of my block waiting to get into Mama's.  Except in this case.  The food immediately transports me back to my time in NOLA and makes me want to return.  Order the gumbo.

Got there at 11:45. Seated at 1:15. Morning + uncaffeinated + 1.5 hour wait = crankypants. It was cold out and raining and by the time I got seated I was miserable and bitchy. Luckily, their lovely coffee and beignet flight perked me right up. Waitresses seemed very aware of the time issue but after waiting for so long, I didn't really want to be rushed. Great food, but I'll come back when their renovation is done or it's no longer hip, whichever comes first.

I love it here!  I tried one of their specials they had on their board outside the restaurant.  Forgot the name of the plate but it was deep fried oysters and bacon omelette with a side of grits and a biscuit.  The omelette was so different and sooo good.  Never had oysters in my omelette before, I highly recommend this dish.  Also tried the flight of beignets, liked all of them except the apple one.  The crawfish beignet was surprisingly good.  I was pretty impressed.  Worth trying!  Also had their chicory coffee and watermelon iced tea....which were both soooo good!  Everything was just sooo good.  I was stuffed before I got to finish my meal that I had to get a take home box.  Ill definitely be here again to try other dishes.

Went here on a Tuesday at about 1:00 P.M. and there was a line of about 10 people at the door. You are not allowed to wait inside as there is no room...there is a small clipboard hanging at the door where you must write your name and place yourself in the dining queue (never saw that before). We ordered a flight of beignets that came with a plain, apple cinnamon, chocolate, and a crawfish. The best one was actually the crawfish. I could have dealt without the other 3 to be honest as they weren't anything to rave about. In fact, they were pretty dry. Our party ordered an omelete with potatoes and a biscuit, marinated shrimp and cheese grits, and the strawberry cobbler pancakes. The meal was nothing short of amazing. All of the food was to die for and it more than made up for the let down which was the beignets. The watermelon ice tea was also spectacular. The place is very cramped and only sits about 40 people so if you are concerned about being too close to people or can't stand long waits, don't come here. Service was also good...highly recommended!

I'd have to say the place is over rated.  All the starches turned out sub-par: potatoes are soft, almost soggy and nearly flavorless.  The grits while swimming in yummy butter, unfortunately also lack the wonderfuil texture I remember so relishing during family reunions along the pre-hurricane Andrew shores of Pawley's Island, South Carolina.  The biscuits, alas, were very dry.  I had a hang-town scramble, and while I very musch enjoyed the odd oyster, which in fact tasted like oyster, alas so too did the overly present ratio of egg, taste like egg, so no winners there.  Incredibly people will wait on the street for an hour to have their party of eight seated, until they finally succomb to their hunger and ask to be seated as smaller tables become available...and I thought law school students were supposed to be intelligent.  I did enjoy the fire-drill that sent the kitchen scurrying when I had to use the bathroom.

Wow. I cant even get into how much I love Brenda's. I would wait an hour to get in this place. The food is excellent; so authentic. Straight up Louisiana cooking. So far, I've endulged on the sweet potato pancakes with butter pecan sauce and powdered sugar....damn! Also the pork chops smothered with molasses was delicious! Oh my god and the catfish with biscuis and the eggs benedict was also delightful!!!!! I love you Brenda, thanks for coming out here to the sco!!!!

So I only write reviews on places that leave a lasting impression or I feel haven't been clearly reflected. Went here on a Wed around 12:30p w/my bf because based on Yelp! & friends info we know it can get busy! So, this place is TINY, like a New York apartment tiny.  The SIGN UP SHEET IT OUTSIDE don't walk in unless you want to sit at the counter, we didn't make that mistake, we signed up & stood outside. Short wait, about 10min. Yes, you have to stand outside, the place is tiny & when ppl have had to wait outside they will take their time to eat, you have to wait your turn. Oh, its SF, it COLD outside, wear a jacket, common sense people. Again, yes, outside, on the sidewalk, like a nightclub. (im repeating this in hopes that people will stop saying it in their reviews.)  We were seated @ a table next to the window, & were VERY close to the people seated on stools @ the counter (fyi), and while we're eating some jerk and his wife keep pressing their face against the window to see what's taking so long inside. I wanted to bang the window sooo badly. (please dont be that idiot, it only ruins other ppls experience & makes them eat slower bc you're irritating) by the way, they'd only been waiting 15min & others were there 30+min & not complaining. About the food, we ordered a bignet flight. Crawfish (to die for), Apple (better after we took it home & microwaved), chocolate (I looove choc, but this was waay too much, & more bittersweet than milky or fudgy choc), plain (just that-dough w/powdered sugar, i've had better)  I ordered shrimp omlette (comes w/grits, eggs, & biscuit) that was the best omlette EVER. only prob, the goat cheese, some type of sauce & major goodies were @ the end opposite where I started. (which made it better when i took it home & microwaved it) Grits (yellow grits not typical white) were a still very buttery, biscuit was like 2 of grandmas biscuits stacked on each other. The bf had some kind of chopped steak over grits, he loved it, it was okaay. I had watermelon Ice tea, which was very good. Not what i expected, tasted like english breakfast tea w/a piece of watermelon in it. (my 2 fav things, married.) I was expecting something like a watermelon flavored tazo tea (the kind @ starbucks), so it was interesting. Waitress, Paige, she was nice. Not overly nice, not rude.  About what i expected from a busy, small place. She came & took our order quickly, brought the food & checked on us here and there. I think they get frustrated when they're swamped & you're asking 25 ?s that are answered on the menu.  Also remember this place is so small the 2-3 waiters are literally stepping on each other & ppl are constantly walking in asking how much lgr. (which is rude) So if you walk in to sit @ the counter or take out & you think they snapped @ you, they prob assumed u were going to ask the  same stupid ? 10 ppl in front of you did. This place was cool, but i'd never wait 45+min to eat here. ie dont come fri-sun. There are plenty of other great places for breakf/brunch.  Maybe bc i grew up on soul food. Oh and price was about average, it was small but felt cozy, other than the fools @ the window, we didn't feel rushed & Paige seemed to appreciate our business. (prob bc we knew what we wanted, ordered quick & didnt ask for much. lol)  Lastly, the portions are HUGE, some ppl have said just order bignets & share an entree. Well we dont like to cook, so we recommend order the bignets & eat half of the entree & take the rest home & have it for dinner, it microwaves well. They do charge .75 for a take home box. (leeches)

San Francisco food caputured my heart in this place.  Sure we've all had beignets....or some sort of high quality donut. But would you ever think to put crawfish and chedder cheese inside, fry it to perfection, and then top it with paprika? The most unique mix of flavors, incredible texture, and all in all a mouthful of delicious. Do it. Do it now.

I have yet to go to Mama's, but this is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in the city.  It fills up fast, so if you want to eat without a wait plan on getting there before 8:30 on weekends, but it's definitely worth the trip.  Try the watermelon sweet tea, the ghiradelli chocolate-filled beignets, the grits, the biscuits...you really can't go wrong with anything.

Well the food was good. the one and only waitress was very professional and awesome . She handled the crowd well . however Brenda needs to get more help or pay her more than she does . And where is Brenda ???She was not there . the place itself is not in a good area and its extremely run down and uncomfortable. You need a btl of olive oil and a shoe horn to get in and get seated. I drove from San Mateo to go there but its not clean or nice enough to continue to go back . I used to drive to Ella's for breakfast until Dan sold the place not its not worth driving to either . Brenda you need a better location or a nicer building. Not good for kids and today when we were there a handicapped person in a wheel chair had a difficult time .However the one and only waitress helped  him . This girl is a real gem . Brenda will loose her if she doesnt do something because some other restaurant will grab her up in a heart beat . Brenda  do you really know what kind of a gem she is ?????

I love eating and I don't ever mind waiting for good food, but today I took a really good friend  to Brendas and waited 2 hours, mind you the parking meters suck in SF. for 25cents you get  6 Min's which blows, so then the hostess calls my name and I go to confirm she ask if my party was with me, I pointed to my friend who was putting money in the meter and he would be right over, she was so f-ing rude and told me she would seat me next then shut the door, not only did it take another 15min but I had to run back and put more money in the meter when I made it back in time to heard her tell my friend we can't seat you until Ur party is here(pissed off at this point) she again didn't seat us, then after 10min we got seated no apology for the wait just told us table to Ur left and that was that!!! Not only were they super rude but when the stubby short dirty blond girl came to give me my bill she was all smiles, what a shocker!!!  The food is good, but those chicks need to check  the attitude at the door before they clock in!!!!!

This place would get 4 stars from me if they did the following. MOVED! This place is truly not worth a two hour wait; the food is good though.  Good food is not hard to find in San Francisco. Anyway, I get there at 10 minutes to 3 and I see the signup list said closed. A lady came out and told me I needed to leave because the list was closed. She did not have room for a party of one.  I figured since I had already waited 15 minutes, I should standby to see if any customers abandoned their spot or walked.She came back out and read two parties who were not present. This stubborn woman still would not seat me! This is what made me find this incident unacceptable, especially in today's economy. This unprofessional woman has no idea I will tell all my coworkers and friends about my horrible experience today. I have referred my office, and even helped promote the establishment by blogging and through print. I work in the service industry and I would have accomadated a customer if two others walked.  They are losing business by people giving up and leaving. Brenda's will need to relocate to a larger location before I ever return again.

UNBELIEVABLE!  Best Burger ever!  Staff was great!  Ambience Great!  Value Great!  Not just a place to eat ... a destination!  Next visit to SF ... breakfast at Brenda's!  PLEASE SHARE WHAT THE SEASONING WAS ON THE BURGER ...

Finally got to eat here!  First time we went the wait was 1 hr 45 min so we went to get Vietnamese sandwiches.  Today we only waited 35 min for 4 people at 9:40am-- not too bad.  Had crawfish beignet, egg & bacon tartine, sweet potato pancakes, hangtown fry, and watermelon ice tea.  First off, ridiculous amt of food.  Can easily share 3 dishes among 4 people.  I'm not a big soul food person so not the best to review.  My husband thought food quite good.  To me, food was a bit brute-- too much, too salty or too sweet.  Watermelon ice tea quite yummy though.  Also liked the apricot jam w/ its chunks of apricots (only slightly too sweet).

Blustery rainy day at 1330h and waiting area was outdoors.  We were seated quickly.  French toast was excellent.  Egg and bacon tartine was tough half french roll covered with equally tough bacon and nice scrambled eggs with tasty sauce.  Side of potatoes was inedible.  Chocolate filled beignets were large and tough, but tasted nice and chocolate was creamy.  Very noisy.

A great waitress can really make the difference between a good and great dining experience.  Recently several of us went to Brenda's (our favorite place in the Tenderloin) to celebrate someone's birthday.  The food was good (as always) but the older waitress appeared overwhelmed and looked around glaring at the diners.  (Brenda's is a small space and very busy.)  Bad timing?  I looked her way and asked if she had been the one to take our order but she emphatically denied it.  A few minutes later, she took our order (and yes she was our initial server).  What gives?  Fortunately there is another waitress who is friendly and gracious~~always coming around to refill tea and coffee with a smile.  Do go to Brenda's and hopefully you'll be served by the friendly waitress.

I was very excited about this potential breakfast spot after reading about it in The Tablehoppers guide by Marcia Gagliardi - which often is on the mark but as in my experience this morning - not always..... First the positive - the service was excellent as were the grits.... However, for a gal who has lived in San Francisco for 22 years, and simply appreciates what San Francisco has to offer ranging from the Richmond, the Avenues, the Mission,  the Western Additon, Russian Hill, the Tenderoloin, Pac Heights to the Marina...I have to say I was so disappointed.  The beignets we so far from the New Orleans prototype I can't tell you (and yes, I've been to New Orleans many times and I know my beignets...) - these were not only huge, but hard and not light or tasty....the biscuitz...geez could they make them any larger?  No wonder we have such an issue with folks unable to control their weight... although honestly they werent that great - and the only spread was either butter or apple compote (which I can tell you none of us liked - I think fresh strawberry jam would make more on an impact and its seasonal....).  I had an egg omelet with sausage - yes, the egg itself was light but it just wasn't anything memorable.   If your looking for heavy, high carb and mediocre food this is it.  I'd suggest Roses Cafe at Steiner and Fillmore any day for the same price - and much much higher quality and lighter cuisine - not to mention if you want a fresh pastry they know what they are doing.  While on the subject - Pacific Puffs right up the street at Union and Fillmore makes the most amazing chocolate cream or strawberry cream puffs - and I never ever liked cream puffs before - when I have to have a sweet and break down I go to Pac Puffs before any cupcake site in the city.....

Went for brunch on a Tuesday. The wait wasn't too long, 10 minutes. The food as good. I had the breakfast: eggs, potatoes, biscuit with butter and jam, bacon!! My friend had the grits and shrimp. She couldn't finish it so I got to eat half her shrimp. Yum!! A lot of rich food, not too expensive, in a cozy atmosphere. The red beans and rice looked awesome, too. The beignets and coffee look like a must have. I want to go back and eat everything on the menu. It looks like they are expanding into the storefront next door so it should be easier to get a table on a weekend morning.

First time at Brenda's and wasn't disappointed.  Best breakfast diner by far on this trip, and cheaper than most.  Great to have some coffee with real flavour,  and the shrimp, goat's cheese and caramelized onion omelette was spot on.  Mostly though it was nice to spend time in a place with some real character.  No queue, but I was there at 08:00am.

A-ma-zing. Got the goat cheese and gulf shrimp omelette and nearly died of happiness. It also came with home fries (that they call "hash") and one of the famed biscuits. At under $10 it's also cheaper than similarly lovely food which is a total plus. I came on a week day afternoon and there was a bit of a wait so I can't even imagine the weekend madness. However, you can call in an order to-go so I guess that helps if you don't care about dining in. Also heard they're working on getting their liquor license so mimosas for everyone soon enough!

My first time at Brenda's I loved it.  After the second visit, I doubt I'll go back.  Moving next door to the refurbished location seems to have stretched the staff and kitchen beyond their limits.  Add to that the cold wind that blows in with each opening of the door, and the place has lost its appeal.  Everyone in the place was huddled in their jackets against the cold.  Service wasn't much to begin with, and now don't expect to see your server once the order is taken, and (much later) delivered.  I don't know, to me "hash browns" imply something crispy and tasty, rather than the lukewarm lump of soggy potatoes I received.  The Hangtown Fry was so-so.  The only winner was the biscuit, but hardly worth enduring the rest of the experience.

Worth the hour or so wait. The beignet's are awesome! (I wish I could have had these to munch on during our wait)  My wife and I did the flight of beignets (plain, chocolate, apple, and crawfish) which was enough but we pressed on.  Hogwash Fry (oyster and bacon scramble) was a nice mix of flavors; the grits are creamy and buttery, and I took the biscuit home to finish.  Wife had the croque monsieur that was good.  Next time we will try to granola pancakes and poboys.

9/7/09: arrived here with wife at 11am, absolutely wrong time to come. we waited for one hour until our name was finally called. this wasn't what i expected, all i could think was how this place has been yelped and now is covered with throngs of people interested in jumping onto the wagon. the wait is much better that at mama's, atleast you're in the shade (which, surprisingly, on this day was needed). we started the meal with requisite benigets, plain version - clearly tasty and still dripping with hot fryer grease, we devoured them within minutes and found our mouths covered with powered sugar. i order the grillades and grits, while my wife tried the gumbo (her first ever) - i was planning to be less adventurous but decided, what the hell, why not since many others were having it. anyways, the meal arrived without too much delay (twenty minutes) and we were soon stuffing ourselves. the biscuit was fantastic and awesome, the grits were well prepared, but the grillades tasted fine but was a bit too greasy for me. i think i ate only half of one beef cutlet.wife's gumbo was delish, bowl was a huge portion leaving probably half for the compost bin. overall good and new experience. peer pressure gives it another half star, 3.5 stars otherwise.

i came to brendas because a friend of mine recommended this place. i can rely on his tastes buds. i have to say i was not disappointed one bit. the service was wonderful. the food was great. i had the pulled pork eggs benedict and  shared the flight of beignets.  first off the grits with my pulled pork eggs benedict was done well. i do love me my grits. it wasnt to thick or too light. the eggs benedict was done well. the biscuit they used added the much needed texture to all the soft elements. they did not over spice the creole gravy which was good. if done abit more it would have over powered the dish. the flight of beignets was wonderful. the warm chocolate insides on one. the wonderful interesting crawfish beignet. mentally im thinking how will this work sweet with crawfish. but no it was all savory. i think they could have dusted a little less with the seasoning on top but thats just me. aside from that it with was wonderful. i had a wonderful experience with brendas. make sure you go early because it packed up really quick after we got there.

Got here on a Saturday around noon and the wait was about 45 minutes.  Not bad since I've waited longer at other places around this time.  The parking situation isn't bad with plenty of metered parking, but my complaint is that they are only 1 hour parking which means that you will have to leave during your meal to feed the meter.  We ordered the hangtown fry (a scramble with oysters and bacon) and oyster po boy and the beignets flight.  I'm a beignet fan, but I wasn't impressed with them here.  The cinnamon apple one tasted like the apple pie at McDonald's back when they used to fry them.  The chocolate one was too sweet and the plain one was flat like a cookie.  The crawfish beignet was the best out of the four by default.  The rest of the meal was just mediocre...not really worth the 45 minute wait.  The staff was polite despite how busy the place was.  Our waitress was rushing to get us out that she cleared our plates even though I wasn't done with mine.  I feel that they should always ask if you're done with your food before clearing your plate.  I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but I'll be going elsewhere for brunch.

Oh my.  Just thinking about those biscuits brings tears to my eyes and sets my wandering mind to wondering . . . .  how the hell can a biscuit be crunchy on the outside, and soft and flaky on the inside?  THAT was the best damned biscuit I have ever had in my whole freaking life.  It was cold and raining outside, but I was determined to get in there and sample one of those biscuits that I saw through the window and had longingly been staring at on the internet through Windows!  Oh yeah, I had the Hangtown Fry with grits too.  Meal was delicious.  Grits so smooth and cheesy (in a good way) and buttery - I could feel my cholesterol risin'.  And the crawfish beignets, incredible.  Coffee was so good, I had two cups.  Brenda's food is amazing (she was there cooking up a storm too) One problem though the place is dime sized - and since I drank 2 cups of coffee and a glass of water and waited for 45 minutes to get in the place, I had to tinkle - and in order to tinkle, you gotta go through the (dramatic pause) KITCHEN?! . . . . Dude, are you serious?  GO THROUGH THE KITCHEN??!!  To get to the bathroom?  Oh Lord, but I gotta PEE BAD!!  Have you ever been in a restaurant kitchen?  I have and it's not fun.  I am going back to Brenda's.  I am taking my friends one at a time 'cause I want to see their faces when they bite into that biscuit for the first time . . . but I am going to make sure we use the bathroom before we go. . .

came here for brunch after checking out bay to breakers this weekend.  yelped it and saw the positive reviews so decided to check it out.  plus it was featured on the 7x7 100 things to eat before you die list, so figured i had to go.  when we arrived there were people waiting outside.  you sign up on the list hanging outside and wait for them to call you inside.  everyone waits outside since the place it pretty small.  i have to give brenda's BIG props for efficiency.  they had us in and out within 30 minutes.  we waited about 20-25 minutes before being seated (not too bad considering i read about people waiting for 2 hours).  we sat down, checked out the menu, got some drinks and then ordered.  the food probably came out in 5-10 minutes (impressive!).  i had the grillades and grits.  i recently tried grits for the first time and now i'm addicted!  the food was pretty good...the meat patties were very different from anything i've had before.  the dish also came with 2 eggs and a biscuit (the biscuit was absolutely DE-LICIOUS!).  i would definitely recommend checking this place out...and definitely try to get a biscuit.

Came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago for lunch with my cousin. We are in walking distance from work and decided to come early to beat the lunchtime rush. At 11:40ish on a Friday, we only waited 10 minutes to be seated. I was surprised because the place is really TINY and we opted to sit at the bar rather than wait for a table.  We ordered the beignet flight because neither of us had tasted them before. I will say that they were not what I expected- the were very doughy and the chocolate one was quite rich. I thought they would be more like doughnuts but they had entirely too much dough to be doughnuts.  My cousin loved the crawfish-me, not so much. I order the shrimp and grits because I am used to eating grits with butter and sugar and these seemed much more adventurous. They were really flavorful and when I brought them home to my husband- who is from the South, he thought they were great. I would come here again and try something else, including the watermelon tea I've heard so much about. I definitely liked my cousin's po boy more than the shrimp grits.

YUM! YUM! The reviews don't lie, this is a fabulous place with a long wait. But its worth the it. Got to Brenda's at about 1:30 pm on a Sunday.  We waited for an hour for a table for two. Started with the beignet flight (4): crawfish, apple pie, chocolate and plain. Beignets were large and the fillings were good though I didn't like the dough at all. Had the shrimp po boy and sweet potato pancakes. The po boy was scrumptious. The bread was light and airy, shrimp perfectly cooked and lightly breaded, sauce had a nice kick to it and added good flavor to the sandwich but was not overpowering. I wanted another one. Sweet Potato pancakes were soooo good! Two large and thick pancakes but they were airy and fluffy. You could taste the sweet potatoes and the caramel sauce with pecans on top were a perfect combination. Just slightly sweet to compliment the dish. The food was really good and worth the wait. I would definitely come back again. While waiting for our food we couldn't help but see what other people were ordering and EVERYTHING looked amazing! Service was prompt and courteous.

Unfortunately like many wildly popular restaurants Brenda's has forgotten about service. The biscuit is the bomb but everything else is usually bland to pretty good. The bottom line is that some of the staff are just plain rude. It has nothing to do with the place being small and busy- it has to do with them not listening to a customer, staff not communicating about what they've told a customer, and quoting an ever changing policy. I've had them tell me to wait at the bar only to be told that if I take a bar seat they won't sit me at a table. When I tried to explain I was cut off numerous times and told that I could have a table as long as no one else was waiting AFTER me. WTF? Like I can go wait out fucking side if that makes it better but was told they wouldn't seat me period. I've also been told that we couldn't split our group of 8 into 2 fours and be seated totally separate because it's their policy to keep groups together.  It seems like the policy is 'we don't give a shit if you eat here because so many people want to eat here that we don't have to care.' My business is going elsewhere.

I went to Brenda's for the first time this past Saturday for a late brunch.  I had already seen a few of the Yelp reviews regarding the wait time, so I wasn't surprised to see that there was a line to get in.  My wait wasn't too bad (25 minutes), but once inside I realized why there was a wait...the restaurant is really tiny.  Once inside everything moves a bit faster.  We were greeted with smiles and offered a drink as soon we sat down.  If you get the watermelon ice tea make sure to add sugar. Next time I'll probably get regular ice tea.  My BF and I shared an order of beignets and was able to order a sampler so we could try all four flavors.  All of them were so good, but the plain beignet with powered sugar and the crawfish and cheddar were my favorites.   We also shared the shrimp and cheese grits, and the andouille sausage and cheddar omelet with potato hash and a biscuit.   All of which was served up hot and fast.  It was delicious.  The grits were creamy with lots of cheese and bacon mixed in and the shrimp on top were cooked in a really tasty tomato sauce.  The omelet was oozing with andouille sausage and cheese and it meshed well with the potato hash.  The biscuit was huge! It tasted great by itself because it was light a fluffy, but was fabulous with the homemade apple butter.  This is defiantly not a place to count calories, but a wonderful place that offers up something different than a regular brunch.  I will go back again in order to try something else.

we didnt get to eat there....waiting in line for half an hour and only moved up the list two parties! so yeah, definitely be prepared to wait in line for a super long time. we decided to leave because we were incredibly hungry and couldnt wait any longer. but the menu looked amazing!!! it hurt standing right there next to the restaurant, watching people eat delicious-looking food....and not being able to join in!! if i ever have a good amount of time to kill, i'll try to find this place again and actually eat there!
