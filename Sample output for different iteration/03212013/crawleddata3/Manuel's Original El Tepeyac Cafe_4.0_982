If it's delicious and authentic Mexican food you crave, then you need not search any further.  Manuel's Original El Tepeyac Cafe, will provide an exhilarating dining experience to remember for a lifetime.  Why, just uttering the named itself, has me chasing my tail and drooling like one of Pavlov's dogs. Certainly this in no secret to Tepeyac's devout and loyal customers, but the "Hollenbeck Machaca Burrito," is legendary for its incredible flavor, and is a surefire winner that will send your palate into full scale sensory overdrive! Speaking of pallets, that reminds me, be forewarned that this is one "Massive" burrito, and you'll know when it's on its way to your table by the beeping sound of the forklift that delivers it. Trust me, you may want to share it with someone special for your first attempt.   Now, if you're not familiar with the area, please know that this is right in the heart of East Los Angeles, and can be for some folks a bit intimidating as you gaze upon the rather edgy environs.  But that's just one more reason to make the journey and bathe yourself in this ultimate cultural dining experience.  Anything worthwhile in life is bound to have a little risk factor.  It  reminds me of my very first visit to this hallmark establishment.  It was in the early 80's and me and a few high school football buddies decided we would make the trip and see what all the buzz was about.  Well, to make a long story longer, one of my friends who just happened to be hearing impaired, was apparently so overwhelmed by the vast selection of menu items, that he began to fire off a barrage of hand sign language to us in an an effort to assist him in choosing the perfect item for his very first visit.  It seemed innocent enough at the time, but unbeknownst to us were a group of locals who interpreted his rapid hand gestures as some form of rival gang signs and before you know it we were being confronted by some truly intimidating and scary individuals.  Guys with tattoos of Aztec Warriors, Virgin Mary's, and Crying Clowns encircling their bronzed flesh were all of sudden distracting us from our delectable desires.  Now, I'm not suggesting you risk your life or do anything crazy like we did, but when it comes to delicious Mexican food, you gotta do what you gotta do.   Fortunately, everything ended peacefully that memorable afternoon, and we were able to negotiate our way out of this apparent volatile situation.  We simply agreed to join their local gang and commit a few initiation crimes to prove our loyalty and everything worked out just fine. I mean aside from spending most of my 20's in a hardcore correctional facility, i can't imagine any other food establishment that would derive this type of loyalty. Okay, okay, you got me.  Perhaps i embellished the facts a bit for my own entertainment value, but the statement i made about the burrito is indeed a verifiable fact.  Go check it out for yourself and i promise you will not be disappointed.  And for  those of you who may have been swayed by my fictional rant, know that there is an additional El Tepeyac in the city of Industry, which offers a much more businesslike environment for those of you who are not willing to allocate 7 to 10 years of your precious lives for the search of the greatest Mexican food. By the way, does anyone know of any affordable tattoo removal specialist?  Just kidding... RIP Manuel.  Your loyal customer's and the entire community will never forget you.

RIP to Manuel. I've been coming here since I was in my mother's womb (I'm told). This was my parents spot in the 80's. I have carried the torch. Mountains of Cheese wrapped around meat stuffed in tacos. No, but serious so much cheddar cheese. It's delicious. The enchiladas have a rich rojo sauce that kicks with each bite. The taquitos and Guac are what it's all about. This is GUT FILLING MEXICAN food. Don't come here looking for a Baja Fresh type venue. This is hardcore, come with an appetite and leave the hoity toity at home. Manuel thanks for the love!

Salute' to Manny  RIP brother! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… https://s3-media2.ak.yel…  One day we'll have another shot of tequila together at the big taco stand in the sky! I'm saddened to see this LA Icon has passed away. But he will not be forgotten by me or the great many patrons he greeted over the years.  http://www.latimes.com/n… This was the first Mexican place I ate at when I moved to CA as a teenager in 1983. My old man took me to all the LA places, Tommys, Pinks, Coles and El Tepeyac , for some cultural exposure. This was my favorite of the bunch. I remember trying the Hollenbeck the first time. I knew this place was for me. While these days I seldom have made my way back there to the restaurant. Over the years I visited them a couple of dozen times and was not once was I disappointed.  I hope El Tepeyac doesn't change with Manny's passing as it has changed little in the almost 30 years since my first visit. I may have to give the Manny's special one more try in his honor. RIP Manny you'll be missed.

No offense to those who love this place but Ive had better mexican food elsewhere. Chips were old and stale. I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito and I have to agree with other yelpers: The meat was dry. The Plus Side: The portions are huge so you do get a lot of bang for your buck.

The news that Manuel Rojas just passed away has reached clear over here to Phoenix.  That's how special his cooking was, & how sad it is to lose the founder of this great little cafe where I've enjoyed many a terrific meal! Here's hoping the family keeps things just as they are here at this (near) East L.A. icon which I've been loving since 1976 when friends first turned me on to it. Now please excuse me to eat the second half of my huge Manuel's Special Burrito that I brought home.     :-))

This place is just a local legend you should go to for the novelty of it. The food isn't amazing as everything is doused in sauce and stuffed with dry meat, but eating a huge burrito and then having leftovers for like 3 days is pretty great. I always find there is tons of liquid in the burritos I order so the leftovers are pretty soggy. I guess this was on Man vs. Food so now everyone is coming here, but the food has remained the same forever.

I went on a West Coast road trip, from Seattle, with a bunch of homies through this Boys and Girls Club teen program I'm involved in. We stayed two nights at the Salesian Boys and Girls Club of East LA. The night we arrived, we went to this local Mexican restaurant they recommended. Despite the fact that it's been all over the food network, I never even heard of it before. We had a van for transportation, but the teen director told us it was within walking distance, so we walked through the streets of East LA for some Mexican food. Thug life For serving a group of 14, the waiters did hella well. The place looked kinda small, and it was warm out so we ate outside, which was covered in cool art, so that's a major plus if you enjoy art. Oh shit, the food. I'm pretty sure Manuel's a legend. I was a part of 4 people who tried to devour Manuel's Special Steak Picado in the biggest size they had. Frickin' WIN. The tortilla was soft, the steak was perfect, and the beans and rice were the truth. Oh, and do yourself a favor and order the Jamaica, it'll make you rethink life. If you live in LA, you better just get the biggest burrito tonight and feed your family for the rest of the week. If you don't live in LA, that's really too bad, unless you're down for the pilgrimage. If you just so happen to be in LA for a weekend, then just do yourself a favor, damnit. In my hopes of dreams of living in LA, I can see myself as a regular at Manuel Original El Tepeyac Cafe. FTMFW!

The pork in our burrito was a bit dry, a complaint heard by other Yelpers. I will admit, it was a bit dry but many other things redeemed our experience on this night. With the competition between Mexican food restaurants, the sheer number of Mexican restaurants, even the legendary El Tepeyec will face critique. The restaurant gets crowded and cramped during the later hours in the day, 5PM or so. Parking is good if you come early, when it is not crowded, at times you may see lines develop at the door. The service was friendly but they do have many customers to tend to. We did not take the Manuel Special Burrito Challege, will you? Everyone loved the quesadilla, grilled crunchy tortilla and hot oozing jack cheese. The Jamaica (Hibiscus) was great, a bit sweet for my taste, (Descendant of Mexicali) but cool and smooth. Some use this drink for the health benefits. Tritia T was not feeling this burrito because of the pork and I can sympathize. But I loved the soft red rice and soft, flavorful beans. I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice. Song parody of R. Kelly's 1994 song "Bump N' Grind" http://www.youtube.com/w… I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice You may critique the pork, but not the rice and beans And I know you like tortilla with cheese I have a complex carbo need A sweet Jamaica on ice sets me free See you need fresh beans, or refried with cheese, to satisfy your foodie needs I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice You say the pork is just to dry Well, have some beans and rice They sides are just so lovely No need to pork no more A burrito you ignore The sides are filled with much foodie luv See you need fresh beans, or refried with cheese, to satisfy your foodie needs I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice I don't see nothing wrong with a little beans and rice

No disrespect to any Tepeyac lovers out there but my review was based on the Hollebeck burrito. Lets be honest, the pork is dry! There's no way to describe it, its dry... the sauce is good, the beans and the rice are onm point but the pork is dry. It totally kills it! That thing was over 9 dollars and I'm sorry but, i was dissapointed. Maybe they can keep the pork in a steam pot?

Came here with my In laws for breakfast and it was crazy decorated in Mexican Christmas bling. This is more like Chicano food rather then  Mexican. I ordered the Chilaquiles and so did my Mother in Law. A few seconds later we decided to share a plate since my Father in Law informed us that the plates were gargantuan . Good thing we did!! We both (mother in law and Moi ) ate some of the Chilaquiles , rice and beans and had plenty left over. My kids ate the rest the next day for breakfast. The leftovers alone fed my 3 kids. Lol The service is great! The place is immaculately clean! The food is not appetizing to my eyes. It was way too much. But none the less a landmark and it was a cool experience. Get well soon Manuel!

I have been eating here since before I was born.  I will eat here my whole life.  If I possible... I will eat this when I'm dead. I have come to this for as many birthdays as I can remember, and there's one reason.  It feels like home.  You have Manuel at the door ready to greet you.  Somehow he knows everyone who has ever been to his restaurant, and will remember random details about you (maybe not your name, but other things).  He'll bring candy for the kids, and a little something special for the adults (who he still remembers as kids). I remember as a kid who didn't like much stuff, they had the best chorizo burritos.  If I ever feel down, one of those things will pick me up in a sec!  The bean and cheese got me through many a Lenten season. For now, I have upgraded to the Manuel's special.  You can take the personal challenge of finishing it, but it's not the best way to enjoy it.  But sharing with three or four friends is a fun afternoon!  I like getting it for myself and just snacking on it the rest of the week. There will probably be a line out front, and for good reason.  It's a very small place, but they are fast once you're in.  It comes so fast they don't give you chips (you have to order them for a couple of bucks, and they are fresh and tasty).  If you don't want to wait, the counter is usually open if it's just one or two people.  They accept card now (crazy, I know). These burritos make others look like soft tacos.  Grab your knife and fork and dig in!

I had been hearing about El Tepeyac for so long.  Finally I had a job on Cesar Chavez blvd and I asked a local person where to go for lunch.  Turns out a mile a way was El Tepeyac.  Finally!  I had heard about the Hollenbeck and was not disappointed.  It's in my GPS favorites now.  I'll be back!  A funny part.  I post a pic of the Hollenbeck on Facebook and said, "Guess where I am."  Three of my friends said "El Tepeyac!  It's a Hollenbeck!"  right away.

To avoid the wait, we ordered from the to-go window around the corner from the restaurant. The menu has a variety of dishes that it made it hard to pick! I ended up having a Chorizo, eggs, and beans burrito and an Horchata. Of course, I was only able to eat about half of the burrito because it was pretty big; however, they have much bigger burritos on the menu if you're up for the challenge of eating one of those bad boys. The food was delicious, and the Horchata was yummy. It's hard to find a place that sells yummy Horchata, and this is one of those spots that does not disappoint! From the looks of it, this place is small, but very much worth the wait. They have patio seating with a canopy to enjoy your meal, if you choose not to wait in line to be seated inside. Customer service is great, and inviting! I will definitely keeps this place on my radar when I'm in the area!

Easily the worst burrito that I've ever had in my entire life, and the reason why I will no longer eat Mexican food in East LA. You may think that is a silly statement. After all, isn't East LA the heart of Mexican culture in Los Angeles? No, sorry. Please understand that East LA has acculturated to the American way of life and the food here is more American than it is Mexican. Case in point: people love to complain about the grotesque ability for Americans to consume large portions of food, and this restaurant embodies just that! The size of the burritos is the sole purpose for any hype that this restaurant receives. The flavor itself is nothing to speak of because it simply doesn't exist. Hence why everything is covered in some kind of hot sauce. I mean, don't you do this all of the time? Douse disgusting fast food with sauce packets so you can scarf down whatever combination of horse and wheat you've just ordered. Manuel's is no different. Stop and think how a restaurant could serve gigantic portions and make a profit. It is by selling you low quality ingredients, and the meat here clearly reflects that.

I like. El Tepeyac Cafe is small, quaint little restaurant with a large following. If you come here, be prepared to wait in line or order take out at the side window. The decor is cute and reminds me of a mom and pop mexican diner. Family photos and El Tepeyac souvenir t-shirts. To my dismay, I was not able to be greeted by Manual or a shot. Instead, I was informed that he has been hospitalized. The food was delicious and portion generous. I shared a machaca bowl and hollenback pork burrito along with 1/4 order of chips and salsa with the girlfriend. The machaca bowl left the greatest impression on me--very tender and packs a lot flavorful goodness. Thank you, Adam Richman, for this find.

Upon recommendation, stopped in to El Tepeyac. After waiting outside ten minutes, we were seated and in a few minutes, the attendant took our orders. To keep up the high quality food, there are no free chips =) We did order some chips n' salsa and they were crispy and tastey; the salsa was pica pica. I always like crispy taco's; so I ordered the #7 Two crispy taco's, one beef and one chicken. They are non greasy, perfectly crispy, packed with a handful of beef or chicken, then, generously  garnished with lettuce and cheese. Muy Bueno! Comes with a side of refried beans and Spanish rice and the remainder of the plate is garnished with a generous amount of shredded fresh lettuce and fresh shredded cheese and finally, a sprinkling of fresh diced tomatoes. Each crispy taco is packed with tastey meaty meat, fresh lettuce and fresh cheese. The Refried beans are creamy and taste good and the spanish rice is fluffy and warm. It's a good sized meal, two light eaters could share and be full. And happy. Nom Nom. Great Mexi food here and friendly vibe. Amazing fact: the attendant brought us some fine brandy. On The House, Gratis. Just a mini shot. How could I refuse? Decor: classic 1950's Los Angeles cool diner with stools covered with red naugahyde. Many many pictures of family and other mex-american traditions. Tip: check out the garden in the back of the parking lot. Parking: ok to tight. We left a generous tip and we left with a happy smile.

This is where the barrio meets the 'hood in East LA. Don't be there after dark. But do wait in daylight as long as necessary for one of the best burritos you'll ever have. That would be the Hollenbeck - enough food for three. I've been going to El Tepeyac since my high school biology teacher took a few of his students on an unofficial field trip back in 1975. The Hollenbeck was $1.70 and its big brother, the Manuel's Special, was $3.50. A lot has changed since then, but the burritos are still great. I think I ordered tacos and taquitos once or twice. Meh. Go with the Hollenbeck. Get that other stuff someplace else. A lot of people talk about traveling to Southern California and making sure they visit In N Out. I try to get to "Teps" instead.

El Tepeyac has got to be one of the most over rated Mexi spot in So Cal, next to Pancho's (Long Beach). The food in general is bland, the portions are small and the prices should be illegal. WAYYYYYYYYYYYY too expensive for what you get. I have said it before and I will say it again, mexican food is CHEAP ( dollar wise) FOOD. Period. I had a number 7 which is two beef tacos, beans and rice, and some shredded lettuce with tomato on top. Our other order was the two taquito plate, also with beans and rice, shredded lettuce with tomato on top. I dont remember what that plate number is. with two soft drinks, the rounded out to $30.00!! UN-FRIGGIN believable! The two beef tacos were so small I thought they were mini tacos, the portion of bean and rice were ridiculous given the price. The beef taquito's were rolled thick, but not a lot of meat. I had a couple bites of the taquitos and they were just as bland as my tacos. With all that East L.A. has to offer, I am amazed that Tepeyac is still there, we actually ended up at Tepeyac because Ciro's was closed (forgot they were closed Monday's) and didnt feel like roaming around East LA late. My advice, eat elsewhere, East L.A. has the best Mexi food around, just not at Tepeyac.

Clearly this place needs another review. So let me get started. My brother was in town and per food network directions asked to go here. So we went for lunch, during the day time because I don't know East LA like that. Just being honest. We got the big ass burrito because there was 3 of us- all of which can put down some burritos. We got the original with the pork. We demolished it.  We couldn't however finish the pound of guacamole that came in the 1/2 order. what the hell. The thing is, I would totally go back because the rest of the menu looked friggin irresistible. The breakfast, gawd i heart Mexican breakfast.  Also, the service was great, the fine ladies and gents in their El Tepeyac hats and costumes were on point. Parking on the side, you have to wait in line outside and all was worth it.   TIP: they have Jukebox! How adorable amirite?

ordered their Hollenback pork burrito (which is the smaller version of the Manuel Special, which is what they're known for) as we as a small side of guac and chips. the chips were pretty fresh and the guac was on point. i didn't like that the onions in the guac weren't chopped and that they were just thrown into the mix like an afterthought. the chips were kinda overfried and too crunchy and hard for my liking. as for the burrito, the pork sauce they put on top was okay...although the pork was completely overcooked...so it was quite dry and hardened. nevertheless, the burrito's size was still very generous and filling. i can see how some ppl would love this place, but for me i don't think i'll be craving or wanting to make the drive to go here.

El Tepeyac is a Los Angeles institution and I am so glad it is still ticking and going strong...just like Manuel!  During my last visit, there was a lot of loud talking, laughter and outbursts at the counter.  I turned to see what all the ruckus was about and there he was - Manuel - flirting with the ladies and having a good ol' time!  I loved it! :) There is always a line but people actually look happy to be in line!  It's the anticipation of having good Mexican food that keeps them happy and not grumpy :) I've had their Chicken Taquitos and Enchilada plates.  Both were delicious!  The guacamole is awesome too!!!  Oh, and the portions are HUGE!!! I'd like to try the famous Hollenbeck Burrito one day just so I can say I had it haha.  I'll just have to make sure it's the one meal I have for the day because it is HUGE.  It's actually a little scary to look at.  Splitting it with 2-3 people would make the task less daunting. AMBIENCE:  It's a little shabby but El Tepeyac is the kind of place where its shabbiness is appreciated.  It is a piece of LA history, after all.  I hope the restaurant never gets a facelift because it's fine just the way it is.  Families eat here, professionals who work in Downtown LA come here for lunch Mon-Fri and people who are hungover come here...all are welcomed! :) There is a dining area inside and a patio section off to the side of the restaurant.   PARKING: There is a small lot next to the restaurant.  Ample street parking. PROS: It's nearly impossible to not get your Mexican food fix here. CONS: I thought it was a bit pricey especially the drinks. OVERALL: I give this place 3.5 stars.

I live in East Los and I have heard the mad hype about this place. I ordered a burrito, I honestly do not remember exactly which one. I've honestly had better. I prefer King Taco burritos. The quesadilla was pretty good though, awesome good. If I go, it would be for the cheesy ass quesadillas, not the burritos.

Too legit. My family and I come here every year for my brother's birthday breakfast, it has become a tradition. It's the time of food we don't mind waking up before 7 am to eat (because we all have busy schedules and it gets packed later in the day). I know every one loves the huge ass burritos, "Manuel's Special," but trust, the rest of the menu delivers too. My papa loves the Huevos Rancheros. I love the Chilaquiles. Some of the best I have had. I know people say the other location, City of Industry, is not as great as this one, the Boyle Heights location. So I would recommend trying the Boyle Heights one if you are interested in this place.

I came here because Man v Food came here. I left fairly impressed. Ok, first of all this place is in a nasty part of the city. Good thing it was across from a church or all hope would be lost for approachability. Prices are closer to the high side, but for a reason. Everything is huge. Almost carelessly huge. But don't get me wrong - it's all good. In my group we ordered a bunch of different burritos. They all came out to be the size of babies. All filled with tender, delicious carne asada and shredded chicken. Lots of vegetables on top making the tortilla worthless, as well. Our side of guacamole would embarrass any other Mexican restaurants' portions. They give you guac by the pound.  Insane. I've never tried so hard to finish a bowl of guac before. I remember I went back to the ordering window to get something else after our meal. It took a while to grab their attention, because they were busy constructing another gigantic masterpiece. I watched and drooled even though I had just eaten. The guy next to me was doing the same. We glanced at each other and nodded. We knew what was up. Deliciousness. Worth it. So, so worth it.

Saw this place on Man vs Food and figured Id try it out on a special occasion. My friend from Germany came to visit so this was a great time to go get some authentic Mexican food. Pro's: Good parking, good portions, good salsa, fast service Con's: The food lacks taste, the ingredients are cold, the price does not match the quality My friend from Germany was not impressed either and he doesn't even eat Mexican food regularly. If you prefer quantity over quality, this is your kind of place.

If you are looking for volume this is the place to go. They have BIG burritos! and at a decent price. Usually i tend to stay away from the peak hours because there is always a line. Good thing they also have a to go window if you are really craving thier awesome burritos. I do wish thier burritos were more flavorful but for the price it is a good deal. Dont expect a fancy gourmet burrito. Expect simple and fullfilling. great small place with a homely feel

Quick and dirty review: it's a "hole in the wall" joint in East Los Angeles. It's literally in the middle of a neighborhood. It's small, when busy it's cramped. Food is a solid 3 out of 5 stars. Is it mouthwatering authentic Mexican? It's tasty, but I've had better. It is definitely overpriced. Overhyped? Yes. Safe yourself the trip unless you're dying of curiosity.

I'll admit I'm biased about Manuel's. My dad grew up in the area and has been eating there since he was kid, and when we were little it was a big deal when we got to go to Manuel's. So, I grew up with this place, and it's kind of annoying to know the history of this place and have a parent who Manuel himself has known for years and hear self-proclaimed food experts disparage this place and call it over hyped. I read some reviews referring to it as a "hole in the wall" with a negative connotation--yup, that's right, this isn't some frou frou place in Silverlake people. It's in Boyle Heights, so deal. Also, I have to wonder if some of the reviews are even truthful--seriously, Manuel's serves food fast. No way you could actually be seated and get your food in less than 15 minutes (usually 10 or even less, depending on your order). At any rate, you do get quantity with Manuel's. But it's also good. Their prices might be on the high side, but you get a lot for your money so you can easily share dishes, or save some for later. I've tried a lot of the Manuel's food--chilaquiles, the chili verde burrito, taquitos, enchiladas and the vegetarian burrito and I like it all. The chilaquiles are delicious, full of chips and cheese and sour cream. Maybe it's because I grew up with this food, but I love their rice and beans and many of the dishes they make come with a generous portion of both. Their guacamole is awesome, and the chips are really good (although you do have to pay for them). Yes, there's often a line to sit in the restaurant, but if you're scared of the neighborhood or too starving to wait, you can order your food to go. They also have tables outside.

My boyfriend and I went here during a road-trip last summer - my boyfriend loves the show Man Vs. Show, which featured this restaurant once. My boyfriend LOVED the Hollenbeck Burrito (we shared it). But.... I found the burrito to be mediocre. Good, but nothing extra special. (we've been their a second time now, and my opinion remained the same.) I have, however, found other people's plates filled with taco's and fajita's and such, to look extremely appealing and look forward to trying something else there the next time I'm in town. Since it HAS been on TV, I would recommend stopping by - just because it's always fun to say 'OOOH, I've been there!'. But it is a tad out of the way if your staying in Beverly Hills/more tourist areas of LA - wouldn't recommend going way out of your way unless your into the TV appeal of it.

I admit that the size of their burrito can draw a wow factor with anyone who's never seen one, but that's just it. It's it's big, but it lacked tastes. I got the Mechaca Bowl that came with a generous portion of dry shredded beef and guacamole. It was so bland, I had to drench my beef with whatever salsa they offered for the table. Although I must say their freshly fried corn tortilla was addicting. BF ordered the manuel's special with regular beef and it was so massive, it scared me a bit. How many calories are in those thing?!! He polished off the whole burrito which I thought was meant for at least 3 people, by himself...ahh I'd hate to go to the bathroom after him!

The Original Hollenbeck Burrito was the size of a small child.  Okay, a preemie baby, but still--you could probably feed my family with one.  We are small people.  It was all very tasty, but I did feel that the meat on the Chili Verde was dry.  And the Chili Verde no es verde but more rojo.  Not the way Nana used to make it.  Service is fast.  I'd give it another go if in the area!  (1/20/13 Note: my comparison of the burrito to a small newborn child just won me a shocked note from another Yelper.  Sorry--didn't mean to sound cannibalistic.  But it's a really big burrito; I guess metaphor does not go down well with some...)

I used to have fond memories of this place but when I recently went back after 10 years since my last visit, I was completely disappointed.  I ordered huevos rancheros and the ranchero sauce seemed to be the universal condiment that looked more like heavy orange goop than the flavorful light ranchero sauce that I remembered.  Is there a new cook?  I had trouble finding the eggs under the heavy "ranchero" sauce, the beans tasted like canned Rosarita beans, and the rice was not memorable or flavorful.   The other plates, chile relleno and enchilada, were also covered in the same heavy orange sauce.  Wasn't it supposed to be ranchero sauce?   Sorry Manuel, we won't be coming back.

El Tepeyac is simply amazing. The service was prompt and welcoming. The food arrived within 10 mins. The ingredients were very fresh. With a party of 3 people, we ordered the Original Hollenbeck and the Machaca bowl and it was just the right amount of food. The Hollenbeck tastes divine; the pork is cooked to perfection, and the guacamole still has bits of avocado, showing that it's made fresh. The portion of the Original Hollenbeck was gigantic, easily a share dish. Pros: food arrived fast, service was prompt, cheap food. Cons: the restaurant is very small (less than 10 tables), the neighborhood is shady at night, the tables are very near each other. Overall: fantastic food.

GUT BOMBS  GUT BOMBS  GUT BOMBS  This is El Cazador and I've been an El Tep fan for decades.  The El Tepeyac Cafe on Evergreen is a seriously famous El Lay cuisine landmark; same "sacred food place" category (known to at least a million Angeleno food fans) as:  Philippe's Original in Old Downtown El Lay, the Dal Rey in Pico Rivera, El Cholo near MacArthur Park [USC], Tommy's (Tommy Koufax's original corner shack in the Rampart Division) [USC], Junior's Deli on the Westside [UCLA], Pink's Hot Dogs on La Brea (where a romantic and cheap Sean Penn proposed marriage to Madonna when they were young), The Apple Pan on Pico [UCLA], Pie 'n Burger [Cal Tech] (the Nobel Prize for burgers?), Brent's Deli in the Valley [CSUN], etc, etc, etc.  HALLELUJAH !!! But I digress.  Food?   Food?  You say you want tasty food?  I have one word:  HOLLENBECK, mi amigos.  The ultimate GUT BOMB.  Eat all of that nasty monster burrito for lunch -- YUMMY -- and, taste it bubbling up all afternoon long. Entertain yourself.  Bravery counts; even in the modern world.  The Hollenbeck burrito is my RECOMMEND. And, for the foodie elites of you out there (and, you know who you are); ambience?:  There is NONE at the El Tep.  A clean diner at best. Car Safety & Personal Security:   Surely, you jest?  The El Tepeyac Cafe is LAPD's (LA's finest) official East El Lay HQ for Code 7 (meal break) time.  Show me any picture, day or night, of the El Tep parking lot during biz hours when there AREN'T LAPD black & whites or LA DWP cars or trucks parked.  No trouble at El Tep.  Ever.  As safe to dine here as at the LA Police Academy coffee shop (speaking of another "sacred food place"). In Summary:  Tasty authentic Mex-El Lay food served in large portions for a man's appetite and for women who eat like men.  GUT BOMBS. At your service, amigos --- El Cazador

Have been going here since the mid-60s.  Always been great.  Outstanding food and service.  While I will try things that friends are having, I always order the same things: either a Machaca dinner, or a Hollenbeck with grated cheese (as well as sauce) on top. Hope that Manny's health keeps up and that he will continue operating this place for many more years.  The new location near the 60/605 interchange just isn't the same, even though the facility is nicer and they have a full bar.  Will post a review of that place separately.

One of the most legit Mexican restaurants ever! I always bring my friends here to give them a taste of authentic Mexican food and to see their face when the huge burritos are delivered to our table =D I always get the carne asada burrito but there is no way I can finish it alone so it's best to share. All of the burritos are massive so make sure you bring your friends if you want to finish the entire plate (or you can take it home and eat it later!)  If you are a guacamole lover then It's totally worth it to get a side of guacamole, it is so delicious! Order some chips or taquitos and start dipping; pretty sure they make it fresh it's so yummy. The place is quite small so when it's crowded a line starts to form outside. It's definitely worth the wait though!

We normally order to go. It's in & out if you call ahead of time.  Their machaca burrito is very good with lots of shredded beef.  The onions and bell peppers add to the sweet spiciness of their salsa.  The Manny Special aka Manuel's Especial is something to try but don't eat it alone unless you weigh 400 lbs and haven't eaten in 3 days.  I got one once and fed a staff of 8 with 1 special.  No lie.  Manny's is one of those iconic places like Pink's, Tommy's, the Hat etc.  It is what it is-a landmark and trademark of LA's food scene.

Well, let's start with this... I just relocated and had seen this place on Man vs Food (I'm sure like most out of towners)  and I remember thinking "damn, that burrito looks sooo good!" I was wrong...So wrong. I really expected this place to taste authentic since it is in East Los, where most residents are latins.. I am mexican myself so I was pretty disappointed as was my fiance who is irish and puerto rican. Parking was fine, the place wasn't as packed as I thought it would be for a Saturday. The staff were very nice... and our food came very fast. The inside is super small, wasn't expecting it to be a whole in the wall, which I didn't mind though since most of those kind of spots are delicious. Anyway, I got a chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole. It had no special flavor to it so I had to keep putting salsa on every bite. The chicken seemed like boiled chicken that was shredded? The red salsa is so not good at all, taste bitter and needed salt. They don't even put cheese in your burrito which I thought was so weird, the server gave us a ton of shredded cheese on a plate. If they had put all that stuff inside with would probably add some flavor to it! The chips seemed to have been made on the spot, those tasted fine and so did the rice they brought out for my daughter. But that's about it. We did order guacamole to start with and that needed some salt and lemon onions anything. So bland. Only thing I liked was that it was like going to my families house to eat, very cozy and family ran. You can tell, but we will not be returning. Total for our meal with tip was $40 for 2 blah burritos and guacamole and 1 coke and water with lemon. (not worth the price)

My fiance, a friend and I waited almost 2 hours for a seat and I was underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were cast too high from the beginning? You step in and it's truly a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. There are a few seats at the counter and a total of less than 8 tables. I didn't even finish 1/4 of my chile relleno - it was nothing like what I've had before. It was sponge-y and trip-ey. It was very very strange! However, my fiance and his friend loved their humongous wet burritos. I tried a few bites of his burrito and I didn't love it either. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. I wish it was! : ( However, Manuel was there and when my fiance told him it was his first time, he came over and gave him a shot of tequila! His hospitality was contagious and generous and the only reason I gave this establishment 3 stars.

FOR NOVELTY PURPOSES ONLY I hate to be the negative Nancy but I'm telling you how it is! Yes... I gave it two stars because as a Los Angeles native I definitely have experienced better. Sat at the counter last night about 8:45. The waitresses are peaches but didn't get my order right. I wanted the #4 with ranchera sauce and not red sauce. I got the red sauce. I didn't take it back because I'm a good sport and I don't like to waste food. Fine, I'll eat it. The red sauce tasted like it was straight out of the can. The beans and rice were pretty much standard but I will say the chicken was tender and flavorful if and when I could get it out of that red nightmare of a sauce. The salsas on the table? El Tepeyuck!! Seriously the worst salsa I have had in my life. Both the green and red. I actually jerked back a bit in surprise when I had the salsa verde. How you can mess up such simple ingredients and have it taste like that?? So bitter! So spicy but with no flavor? How'd the sam hill did that happen? It seemed like I was nickle and dimed every step of the way for every little moco! $2.75 for Horchata no refills, $1.45 for a dollop of sour cream to try to mask that devil red sauce. More $ for chips, $5 for quacamole (which was fine)... No! The madness stops here! So, you want a gigantic burrito of mundane ingredients that was featured on a second rate reality food show? Take the instagram pictures and post them, say you did it and ventured into the hood. You will never be back unless you don't know any better. I say,  lob that burrito in any direction in East LA and find a better burrito with exquisite, certified abuelita made salsas for much cheaper.

Visiting from out of town, this place could not give a better representation of authentic home style Mexican food and cuisine. Bring your appetite and order sensibly because the portions are epically large! If you are a burrito fan, you cannot go wrong with the "Manuel original." Speaking of Manuel, I hope you get the honor of meeting this special host. The last two times I visited I was offered tequila shots at 11am from the 79 year old founder. Enjoy, get their early to avoid lines and appreciate this truly LA Mexican food gem.

Hahaha, like many others, I heard about this place from Man v Food.  It turns out my Dad used to come here when he was younger as well.  He told me some funny stories about his interactions with Manuel, the owner. I am a man of value, and this place gives it to you.  I get the Okie Burrito because it comes swimming in red sauce.  I get the carnitas.  There are chunks of carnitas in the burrito AND on top of it.  Lots of cheese.  Beans.  Delicious. That being said, have I had better tasting burritos and carnitas... sure, but not for this kind of price value.   Tepeyac is popular and it can get crowded at times, avoid high traffic hours, like lunch and after work.  The place is small, so if you can't find a place to sit, expect to wait in a line or take it to go. You will most likely not finish your burrito, so you'll have some left over for tomorrow. The Manuel Special is giant.  I can't even finish the smaller Okie.   Anyway, this place is a LA staple and you need to come eat here.   Normally, I would give this place about 4 stars, however, I have to give it 5 stars because of the incredible value.  The food is good and there is a lot of it, and they deserve kudos for that.  If the food were bad, they wouldn't be considered a value play. Definitely one of the ultimate WET burritos though, phew.

We saw this place on "man vs. food" and decided to give it a try. (I also saw it featured on "Southland") If you're getting a burrito, get the Machaca over the asada. And man these burritos are HUGE! The place is small and the line to get in was HHUUGGEE!!! We just decided to sit at the counter and then the wait was only 2 minutes or so. So be aware. But this place is definitely a must try for sure!....it just isn't "amazing".

Ive been consuming Manuel's food since my mom got pregnant with me twenty two years ago. EVERYTHING is delish. When I go, I always spilt a Manuel's Special (massive burrito in guac., meat [beef or chicken], cheese, rice and beans) with my brother and father (its that big). Decent pricing, friendly fast service. I also reccomend their chicken taquitos, cheese or chicken enchiladas, Manuel Special (if you're a huge eater or eating in a group). Sometimes Manuel is there when the line is long and he'll offer you a free shot right then and there! Hahaha! I don't drink but most other latinos do so this is a pretty nice gesture hahaha

I was on a roadtrip with 11 high schoolers and we were staying at the Boys & Girls Club in the neighborhood. We asked the employees and kids at the Club where we should eat, and everyone said "El Tepeyac." Being that we were a group of 13 black or white people, the guy who worked at the Club walked us there and ate with us. I'm not sure if any non-Mexican people have ever been in that neighborhood. It was a great experience, especially for my teens. The restaurant is basically an experience in and of itself. We got the Manuel's Special burrito and it was legitimately huge. What the actual fuck. It came in one of those big tin serving trays that could otherwise be used as like a baby crib or something. It wasn't just huge, either; it was really good. In ordinary fashion, I just asked the waiter what was best and we went with that. I got the Jamaica to drink and it was for the win.

Manny...Manny...Manny... Dunno how you did it but I went to your place twice in one week.   I went with my girlfriends for dinner and I was skeptical at first.  I tried El Manuel Tepeyac @ City of Industry and I never went back.  Simply put, not a fan. Ordered burrito de asada ($9.25).  I was disappointed when I found out this place didn't have any carnitas.  What do you mean no carnitas?  The worker let me sample the pork and I decided to order carne asada instead. The burrito was good and its carne asada was finely chopped.  They were generous with both beans and guac.  Too much bean but loving its chunky guac.   I went back again 2 days later since I was craving its carne asada and guac bad.  Yea..I ordered the same thing again.  It was still good, but not as good as the first time.  My carne asada was chunky and this time I asked for less beans.  Its meat wasn't as tasty as the meat I tasted on my first visit. Service was amazing!!!  I asked for extra sauce and got it in seconds.  Someone was always checking to make sure I got everything I needed.  I ate half of the burrito because I didn't want to be Ms. Piggy (even though it's hard to stop eating) and the worker actually grabbed a new tortilla and made a new burrito from the leftover. Funny how this place is so different compared to Industry location.  This place is like a neighborhood place and Industry place is so corporate.  Service is efficient, fast and friendly here and the other location messes up all my orders.  The food at this location is 10X better too. Plenty of parking and I think I saw Manny sitting in this small white car parked next to me.   4 stars!!   Manuel's Original El Tepeyac Cafe is kinda yummylicious!!

I visited this place after seeing it on television. The guacamole/taquitos were what  brought me here but once I arrived, most people were wolfing down burritos and so that's what I ordered. I ordered the Machaca burrito with enchalada sauce. Now you can see from the photos above that these are as big as your forearm and somehow I managed to put away three-quarters of it. Afterwards I felt proud and disgustingly full at the same time. Since it also happened to be my birthday...they did not hesitate to pour me and my girlfriend each a shot of tequila (maybe moonshine because it came out of a Vitamin water bottle). On top of that, they played a Happy Birthday song on the old school juke box. It was so unexpected, but everyone was so incredibly  jovial and friendly that I won't soon forget it. Overall this place deserves five stars from me because of the friendly and fast service, good taste, big portions, and great value for what I ordered. Bravo!

Overrated.  Lines are long and this place is one of the biggest hole-in-the-walls in a really ghetto area...NOT someplace you'd visit at night.   I ordered their so-called "legendary" Hollenbeck carne asada burrito and it was edible at best.  The carne asada meat was barely cooked and the sauce was just watery and flavorless...reminded me of tomato water with salt and bell peppers.  Maybe I should have ordered something else like the taquitos or tacos (which were recommended by a friend) but yelp lured me to try the burrito.  At $10, this place was disappointing.   #BURRITO_FAIL

So as my bf and I were leaving CSULA and we thought it would be a good idea to eat before we got on the freeway so he yelped mexican food and became super excited when this place popped up since he saw it on the man vs food...or some tv show..not sure. Anyways, we went in at about 3pm and there was not a lot of people. We sat ourselves and the waitress came over and took our order. We ordered a chicken burrito (it says it feeds 3-5 people or something like that). When the lady brought it out I almost had a heart attack!! IT WAS GIANT! We ate less than half and I was surprised because my bf is a monster and he eats like a pig. Overall, the taste of the chicken was really good. The burrito had beans, rice, chicken, and chili. I would come back and would recommend if you are around the area.

I love this place. I always get the taquitos because I love their guacamole. Their burritos are HUGE, but my friend got the Hollenbeck and ate it all in one sitting. She said she didn't feel so good the rest of the day, so take that as you will. The service could be a little more attentive (I had to wait a while to get a refill on my water) but the food comes out so fast that you are basically in and out. Great food.

I always get the giant Manuel's Special burritos. (1 burrito is $20ish and will at least feed three men, easily). The novelty of such a large burrito is well worth the sacrifices in burrito construction which you lose. It's almost more like eating a whole animal family style than eating a burrito.

Went on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. A short line of people were waiting to be seated inside as expected from what I read in the reviews. The hubby and I decided to get the food to-go at the window on the side of the building. That line was pretty short and they helped each customer very quickly. We ordered the Hollenbeck - one of the most recommended burritos in reviews and I believe it was the one featured on TV?? and a side of guacamole and chips and a couple horchatas. There is a huge outdoor eating area, mostly covered overhead, and you can just get your food "to-go" and eat it there. Pros: -Burritos are as huge as people say they are. The two of us are big eaters, starving and needing food to pick us up after getting our pockets emptied (just had our taxes done down the street). -Guacamole was HUGE for a small size and you can taste the freshness of the avocados. -Tender, juicy meat. -Fast service. Cons: -Size isn't everything. Don't get me wrong- the Hollenbeck was delicious, but I've had better. The large size does not yield equal distribution of ingredients. My half had a ton of meat and some beans, my husband's side had some meat, little beans and a TON of rice. The massiveness of the burrito also makes you want a better tortilla-to-meat ratio. If I am in the area, I'd probably try El Tepayac again but I wouldn't drive there for no reason other than to have their food. -The menu board outside doesn't give much of a description of what is in the entrees. It is like they assume that you know what a Hollenbeck, Okie and Oscar entail.

I remember back in the days Manuel would give us shots of tequila in the morning to my friends and I.  If your looking for a place to eat and drink a beer get there be for noon they stop selling beer at a certain time call them it's be for noon I think. To all you Haters out there El Tepeyac  lives up to the hype ya there is plenty of places to eat Mexican food in LA but this is one of the originals in Boyle Heights/Los Angeles it's a land mark for people in LA go with a appetite if your going to order the Manuel Special it is Big if you can Finnish one by your self you will get put up on the wall of fame and get a free t-shirt. I love there Hollenbeck Burrito with Asada with rice, beans,guacamole topped with sauce,again  if your real Hungry  order the Manuel Special it will feed 2 to 4 people try the Chile Verde  it is huge take a friend your going to need help. Family owned and nice people and you could order to go. It's a must try at list once if you love Mexican food this place was on Man Vs Food Tv.

The oversized burritos are overhyped. The burrito is huge but the flavor is lacking. It's super salty and that's about it. I'd say the only saving grace was the guacamole in the burrito - so chunky and yummy. This place is obviously well-known and worth trying once, but a second trip is probably very unlikely.

My dad was super excited to bring me here for lunch. He has been eating here since he was in high school and he raved about how great it was. We arrived at a good time and there was barely anybody here, no wait. The waitress was very nice and attentive and helped us right away. I decided to get a burrito even though I knew there was no way I would finish it. I went with the Hollenbeck de Machaca - typical Machaca burrito, but also with rice, beans, and guacamole inside. My dad ordered a shredded beef enchilada and a cheese quesadilla. The food didn't take long to arrive. My burrito was massive, as big as my freakin head. It was delicious!! I ate half of it and took the other half home for my boyfriend. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the guacamole was fresh. Very, very good. My dad's enchilada tasted like it was made with Las Palmas sauce, which is good, but definitely not homemade. His quesadilla was really good, super cheesy and kind of burnt on the bottom. I love burnt cheese :) I ate one piece of that with the green salsa they give you. Very cheap meal, about $20 for lots of food and two drinks. I would definitely come here again.

I had a chicken salad at El Tepeyac. I know. I'm probably the only customer that has ever walked through their doors and ordered, of all things, a salad. El Tepeyac is famous and beloved for their burritos of enormous proportions. The burritos have been well-reviewed by other Yelpers already, so I'll keep this brief. I've had the Hollenbeck a couple times and the Okie, and preferred the original Hollenbeck. Yes, the first time I came here, I ate the whole burrito for lunch... and then I didn't eat dinner. Never again. After that, I always cut half or 1/3 of it to set aside and take home for later. The burritos don't really taste that special to me... I think it's moreso that the ridiculous size is the huge draw. And now... the review you've all been waiting for... the chicken salad. El Tepeyac, or any Mexican joint, really isn't a good place to go to if you're trying to watch your diet. However, I came for a birthday lunch today, and was determined to stay my ground. Mission: To order something a little less heavy... so, the salad. The chicken salad costs $9.50, and comes with grilled chicken, iceberg lettuce, jack cheese, grilled onions, avocado slices, tomato slices, tortilla chip strips, cilantro, and bacon. I requested no bacon and dressing on the side. The menu advises that it takes 15 minutes to prepare. I really should have used the burritos to guide my expectations, however... because the plate came, and the portion was ENORMOUS. It's piled high, covers the entire plate, and is larger than any of the regular burritos. This thing would easily feed two, and possibly three people. So much for going light! Consistent with their apparent mantra of "bigger is better," they gave a plate of two huge containers of salad dressing, which looked like thousand island and some other kind of viscous clear stuff with red flakes... Italian? The plate also had a container of several lemon wedges, which I opted to squeeze over my salad instead. The salad was... a little ordinary. I'm not much of a fan of iceberg lettuce, although there really wasn't much of it under the huge pile of ingredients. I thought the onions were tasty, and the chicken was good at first... and then it started to taste dry. If I were to go back, I probably wouldn't order this, though it was kinda fun... which lends credence to my theory that at this place, it's moreso that the ridiculous size is the huge draw. This totally isn't the point of Yelp, but I did take all my leftovers home, and had it for dinner after adding spinach, kale, quinoa, chickpeas, and some of El Tepeyac's guacamole... and wow, I thought it tasted a lot better. But, personal preferences. Service today was great. We came in a large party of 11 at lunch and were seated outdoors, which I actually preferred to the inside. We were also treated to beer, tequila, or brandy! If I wasn't trying to be health-conscious, and it wasn't in the middle of a work day, I would have been tempted to imbibe...

The burritos are enormous, you get a huge side of guacamole with most orders which is amazing. They even let you try a sample of the meats before you order. They are all delicious. The dining room is small and they don't serve alcohol. It's better to go at an off-time so you're not waiting outside in line, however they do have carry-out. I like sitting at the bar.

If you live in LA, check this place out FOR SURE. I had a road trip through Cali last October, and this place was a definite pit stop, after seeing it on Man Vs Food.  On television the portions looked huge and delicious -- and the owner seemed like a very nice guy. First attempt: We drove through east LA on a weekday night, and realized that we were near the restaurant.  The restaurant is in an area that looks a little sketch, particularly at nighttime, but that doesn't bother me.  In fact, it probably adds to its appeal.   As I approach the restaurant, I notice a lone car parked in front of the restaurant.  I pass by the car, and I hear "psst, hey man."  I turn, and quickly try to remember all my very useful tae kwon do moves I learned when I was 11.  Lucky him -- I didn't need them. He explains that the restaurant just closed, and that it will be open tomorrow morning.  He proceeds to tell me that if I come in the morning, before 12 I can meet the owner, Manuel.  Thanks, random sketchy guy. Just the info I was looking for. Next Morning: The neighborhood looks a lot nicer in the LA sun and smog.  We approach the restaurant, and I notice the dark silhouette of an older man standing outside, enjoying the first rays of morning pollution.  It's Manuel. I recognize Manuel, and when I say, "Hi Manuel" to him, he greets me as though I thought I just saw a family member I haven't seen in a while (ie, a positive response).  He wasn't fake at all.  He genuinely likes people. My friend and I talk to him for a bit, and after he realizes I'm visiting for my birthday he has us sit down at the counter in the front and gets us free shots, and later comes around and tells us we should drink more so he gives us some beer.  He stops by and checks on us throughout the meal to tell us interesting stories. We ate the hollenbeck burritos which were large, and I thought quite tasty as well.  Everyone who works there is either family or close friends of the family.  The waitress came around later, after we were full, and forced us to eat some machaca (sp?).  It was some type of beef/egg/cheese medley.  It was so good, I cried. Overall: Everything contributed to this experience to make it perfect, but for me this was the best restaurant experience I have had to date.  Your experience may be different, but at the very least, go to this restaurant and visit these people.

The Hollenbeck burrito is quite the beast.  I was sent here by Jonathan Gold and his "99 Things To Eat in LA Before You Die" list.  Came with a party of about 12, for dinner on a weeknight (so it wasn't too crowded).  We all pretty much got that burrito.  And we all thought it was pretty mediocre.   This really is a Quantity over Quality type place.  The economics of a burrito that large make you understand that they can't be using great ingredients if they are selling it for that cheap.  Everything stuffed inside of it reminded me of the burritos at Cafe 84 at USC when I was a freshman in 2003/2004.  So basically what I am saying is that this is a larger version of dorm food. If you are in the neighborhood, then sure stop by.  But don't bother making a trek all the way out here from Silver Lake like I did.  There are far superior burritos around where you live.

I really like their burritos.  They are a tad big though.  I got a Hollenbeck chile verde. This was easily big enough for two.  Instead, I saved half for lunch the next day.  Even as left overs this thing rocked. Get the guacamole too, cant go wrong there. If you have more than 3 in your party, go to the el tapeyac in city of industry, this site is small.

The original hollenbeck is the best burrito ever made. The chunks of pork are tasty and the chiles and tomatoes they are cooked in compliment it very well. I've been going there for 30 years and only had three things--quesadilla, bean burrito, and finally a graduation to the hollenbeck when my tastes matured. I highly recommend getting cheese added to your hollenbeck and then maybe a sprinkle of salt. Perfect! Parking can be tough and there is often a wait outside in line. But it's always worth it!

Revisiting my roots is certainly not good for the waistline, but my tummy hasn't been happier! The decor and the ambiance has not changed over the years. If not mistaken, they have been open since 1955. This was THE place to go after football games and just because. This is truly a LA icon that has weathered and survived the bad times. Seated at the counter were the locals that frequent the place, in "Cheers" like fashion http://www.yelp.com/biz_…,  http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. Conversations about family and friends were our background noise. The task at hand of ordering was difficult for me and hubby. Mom was easy and she ordered the bacon and eggs $7.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. I finally decided on the Huevos con chorizo $7.50 nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZefFhlg3YlP2mG0Z6­WVc0A?select=j2T3tHJkPBOQc8yzH16YHw and hubby decided on the chilaquiles $13.25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. Interesting how they indicate on the menu that certain burritos feed 4 - 6 people, but absolutely no warning about their other items! Each of the plates included a massive amount of rice and beans and of the main item! Their flour tortillas were the size of a flying saucer! Mom did her best with her plate eating some of the rice and beans, 1 egg and half of the bacon. Quite impressed! I THOUGHT I could eat all of the huevos con chorizo, NOT! I cut the tortilla with my hands into pieces and scoop the chorizo with the tortilla. Since the tortilla is humongous, I was only able to eat half of my chorizo and a small minuscule taste of the rice and beans.  Might I add it was comfort food fit for my tummy... Not greasy, just sheer happiness. On to hubby's mondo plate of chilaquiles!  Sitting regally on a bigger plate was this massive amount of chilaquiles. It was quite daunting. His eyes widened and he started his attempt to make a dent.  It was quite tasty with the scrambled eggs on top of the fried tortillas, chiles and massive amount of cheese. He ate around the perimeter and was able to whittle the 12" round of comfort food down to 11".  kudos for his valiant effort. As we sat there wondering how we were able to do as well as we did, Manuel himself came in and greeted us at our table.  He shook hubby's hand, kissed Mom and me on our hands! Wow... Chivalry isn't dead and the gesture would make any woman swoon. He said he loves Nihongenes (Japanese). How the heck did he know? Impressed once again. He then asked my hubby if he wanted a brandy. Hubby loves brandy and after recovering from the initial shock, he accepted the kind gesture. His belly was quite happy! We kindly asked them to box our five pounds of leftovers and gladly paid the bill, and vowed to be back! Food - 5 Stars Service - 5 Stars Ambiance - 5 Stars - thanks for bringing back the memories of late night football game eating extravaganzas! And for Manuel's kindness. Anyone have any ideas for the leftovers?

This review is for take-out only. So I've lived about 5 min away from El Tepeyac my entire life, but the lines always kept me away. Thanks to yelp, I found that they have take-out, with it's seperate window around the corner! My next problem was this, El Tepeyac is known for it's huge meaty burritos, and I'm a vegetarian...but thanks to yelp once again, I found that they have a vegetarian burrito! That was it, nothing holding me back from El Tepeyac any longer...so off I went. It was a Saturday night, but it was raining, and there was still a line for people to be seated! Armed with my knowledge of the take-out window though, I confidently walked around the corner as if I had done this many times before (this is why I love yelp, never lets me look lost and foolish when going places for the first tme) There was a nice covered patio area with tables and a huge poster of the menu, but I already knew what I was ordering. I was greeted by a friendly young woman and ordered my vegetarian burrito. It came out to about $8. I took a seat and waited. No lie, my order was ready in less than 5 minutes, despite the fact that they were super busy. I couldn't wait to get home to see what the fuss was all about so as soon as I got in the car I opened up my box and was amazed at the size of my "burrito"! Let's just say it was BIG. and it smelled soooo delicious! The 5 min drive home seemed so long as I couldn't wait to try it. Well, about 1/4 into it, I realized I was stuffed! Beans, rice, guacamole, cheese, and some sort of tomato sauce were the perfect combination that made this burrito. My bf tried it and was also susprised by how good it was but couldn't finish it either. The next day, I had the leftovers for lunch and it was still great. I will definately be going back to el tepeyac, and probably try dining in.

I could have killed my boyfriend for taking me here.  This is his favorite place, he swears by the 'hollenbeck' or something like that (which looked unnaturally juicy and disgusting).   First, I'm vegan.  So...there are not a lot of options for my particular choice of diet.  Second, after watching a stray dog run up and pee on the outside table area, I wouldn't have ate anything anyway.  Third, is this place even safe?!  I was cat called and 'holler'd" at by the church go-ers across the street.  Seriously.  Ugh. Long story short, I felt uncomfortable by the menu, the area, and the over all vibe of this place.

First, let me get something off my chest.  I am sick and tired of people who think they are "foodies" and leaving negative comments about what really are great places to eat in Los Angeles. Look at yourself in a mirror. Stop being an ass. Just because your family forced fed you chicken feet or jelly fish as a child, that doesn't make you an expert food critic.   On to my review... if you are looking for authentic mexican cuisine in the heart of east los angeles, i strongly recommend you come here.  You will not get any fancy garnishes or presentations with the dishes here.  Just good ol' down home east los angeles mexican food.  If you want the fancy mexican dishes, you need to go to Bayless' Red O in West Hollywood.  At El Tepeyac, there are no fancy gimics. Think of it as a diner or cafe.  A casual setting serving comfort food.   So for you people out there pretending to be food critics... You should stop wasting our time getting in line to eat at this fine establishment. We don't like you here.  There's a restaurant called "Chipotle" just for people like you.

We must've smelled like bacon, because Manny's first words to us were, "are you guys on duty?"  When we told him we weren't, but his instincts were damned close, his next question was, "well, then, you want some margaritas, right?"  We politely and regretfully declined, but not before Manny sweet talked the females in our group.  Guys, lock up your girlfriends and wives because Manny is a smooth operator and his place kicks out great food. I had the Hollenbeck carne asada burrito with cilantro and onions.  The waitress waivered when I ordered, and asked if it was just for me.  When I answered in the affirmative, she just giggled, and told me okay.  That's because this burrito was enough food for two people with regular appetites.  It hit the spot nicely, and even though I didn't finish more than two thirds of it, I was in a food coma for a good two hours afterward.  Before we settled the bill, our playful waitress made sure to rub in the fact that she knew I wouldn't be able to finish the burrito, but was kind enough to package what was left of it for me to take home since she said she could tell I was one of those guys that needs a woman's help.  I tell you, the people who run this place are sharp cookies.  :-) As we were leaving, we walked past a guy who had ordered the Manny's Special burrito.  I told you that I thought I had done alright by finishing most of my burrito, but, let me tell you, if that dude finished one quarter of the Manny's Special, I would've been owned.  That burrito is almost the size of a football.  No joke. I was going to give the place four stars for the long wait and cramped quarters inside, but I think that Manny and our waitress deserve better.  Check it out the next time you're in East LA - just plan for some nap time afterward.

Was greeted by the infamous Manuel who was working the floor by greeting patrons and leading them to their table. I was really excited to try this establishment after seeing it on Man vs. Food. Decided to try this place for some post-race grub (LA Rock N Roll). I wasn't in the mood for the 5-lb burrito. I was actually looking for my usual Cali burrito, but was bummed that I didn't see it. I opted to order the carne asada burrito ($9.25). It was noted that it would take about 15 mins for the order to come out. I was ok to wait for deliciousness. Less than 5 mins later, my order came out. It was massive!!! When I took one bite of the carne asada, I was disappointed! The carne was dry, hard, and tasteless. Did I place the wrong order??? I finished about a quarter of the burrito and took the rest home. The chips were good and crisp ($1.75), however, the salsa was too spicy for my liking. The service was prompt and friendly and I got to talking to Manuel. We even took a picture together! What a sweet old man!!! There is a parking lot next to the restaurant with street parking available in the neighborhood. The restaurant is small, and can only hold about 40 patrons. Be prepared to wait if you decide to come on a weekend.

I've been visiting College BFF (CBFF) in Eess El Ley for a decade; I hate that I'm just now discovering El Tepeyac. The bottom line is--if you top my nachos with a heaping helping of chunky guac & use thick, non-greasy tortilla chips--you get five stars. The shredded white meat chicken was a bonus & I can even forgive the ungodly blanket of cheddar cheese because it was easily pushed aside (can we say instant artery clogger?!) $9.95 for a portion that fed three. The rest of our order was equally gigantic & equally five-star worthy. My cousin & I shared a two taquito plate ($7.50, again, with generous scoops of guac); shredded beef for her & shredded chicken for me. The bf ordered a Carne asada burrito called a Hollenbeck ($9.55, no idea where the name came from.) El Tepeyec has its own parking lot, a cozy, comfy dining area & quick (but not always accurate) service. As if the CBFF wasn't reason enough to visit this part of LA, now I've got a nacho joint to look forward to. And you know how much I love nachos...if you don't know, check my ample nachos list (now you know beybeh beybeh uhh.)

Manuel's Tepeyac is an East L.A. classic! I've tried many items from the menu and there's never been a letdown. My favorite is the Huevos Rancheros plate for breakfast! I'm also a fan of the famous Hollenbeck burrito. It's a tiny place so if you want to eat inside plan on waiting in a long line. We mostly eat outside in the patio area. Visit this place if you haven't already, it's authentic mexican food and super yummy!

Don't go there!!! If you do, DO NOT order a bean and cheese! It is the worst burrito I've ever had. Also tried the foot long asada burrito was very unhappy. I drove 40 mins to go try it was not worth it what so ever!!! I will say the waitress was nice and they're chips and guacamole are really good but thats it!!! Oh yea also tried the enchilada no good, it was filled with a little to much cheese that wasn't even melted!!! :(

Wow they really know how to maximize the floor space haha. There's tables and chairs crammed in every free space available. If there's a group or line of people outside you might want to go inside and speak with one of the waiters or waitresses to let them know how many people you need a table for (they don't make a list or take names, they seem to just remember the number of people in your group and call you by that - shrug) the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar. We ordered a carne asada burrito and one beef one chicken taquitos with rice beans and guacamole. The meat inside the burrito was not what we are used to, they were sort of hard cubed beef pieces inside and the outside is smothered with sauce. It was ok not that great, but maybe that's just how it's supposed to be? the taquitos were ok too, same tough meats inside. I usually like the meats to fill up most the roll but it didn't, I got left with a lot of tortilla at the ends. The hot sauces were not that good. The spiciest one tasted like chemicals and not like fresh peppers. Not sure if this place just got the hype from the food channel show but the food was just edible not yummy.

Been wanting to try out this place ever since I saw man vs food where Adam chowed down a 5 lbs burrito ... went on a Sunday around like 2pm waited in line outside to be seated for maybe like 15minutes and went I got inside i was shocked to see how small the place is. I ordered the carne asada burrito while my partner ordered the wet carne asada burrito . we ordered some chips and salsa also and I really enjoyed the chips it was fresh and the salsa was really good too ! when the burritos came, I was shocked to see how big it was ! their very generous w/ the guacamole on the side too ! when I took a bite of my burrito, I was immediately disappointed as to the quality of the carne asada was not not very good at all... you can just tell they did not use charcoal or grill it and they also didn't use ranchera meat whatever meat they use was chewy, hard and mostly fat it's so disgusting! I hate poor quality and tasting meat... my burrito was $9 and yea sure it was good value but I rather take quality over quantity any day ! my partner and I both agreed we rather have gone to chioptle and got a barbacoa burrito where we know the meat quality and taste is much better ! I had way better carne asada burrito from other mexican restaurants this place was a disappointment sorry to say !

All I will say is Hollenbeck burrito! It is huge and flavorful. The beef is so damn tender. Definitely a knife & fork burrito which can be shared by 2 to 3 people. This place is small, holds no more then about 15 people. A lot of people just order takeout on the side because I heard this place can get super busy. I went on a week day around 11am so it wasn't to bad. My coworker and I went as she had been bragging about their burritos And oh boy she was not lying ! Customer service was excellent. Luckily when we went they had just celebrated an anniversary the owner gave us free tequila shots.

So the man who owns this place is funny and gives his guests a shot of tequila.  He's great and you can tell he loves his patrons and his restaurant.  He is an institution, he's not stodgy and well -liked.   I'm not a Mexican food expert but the last time I checked, Chile Verde is not Red so here it is Red sauce and the pork was chewy and slightly tough. I was craving tomatillos and chile and the red sauce didn't work for me.   I was not impressed, it was a huge portion though so I'm guessing that is another draw to this place.  And honestly, Im not into getting a dish only to dare myself to finish it, because it's a large portion.   I will not write a review for the Cheesecake Factory for this reason, LOL.  Maybe ill go back one day and try other things.

Yep, gonna start this with... "I've been eating here since I was a kid."  I still remember when the Hollenbecks were shy of $3.  A testament to how long I've been gorging myself here.  I miss the window server with a very distinctive voice - c'mon y'all know who I'm writing about!  But, I miss the flavor of the Hollenbeck from "back in the day" even more.   Met a couple of my old friends from Evergreen Elementary and Hollenbeck Junior High the other day for lunch, and was anxiously awaiting to sink "los dientes" into a savory Hollenbeck.  WTH, the chile verde was tomatoey and there was too much of the chewy meat!  Granted, the meat has always been somewhat chewy, but in small quantities I was able get it down.  And, they forgot my lechuga y tomates a lado!!! One buddy ordered a Hollenbeck w/ Machaca and was very disappointed in the lack of eggs, onions, jalapenos, and flavor.  Mostly dry shredded beef.  He said that the last few times he's been here, the quality has been on the decline.  However, that did not stop him from devouring the entire burro! My other buddy ordered the Hollenbeck and seemed to think it tasted the same.  Sorry dude, I think you left your tastebuds behind when you departed "da hood." Perhaps, Manuel should exercise a little QC on his menu items and bring back the wonderful flavors from my memories.   On a side note, enjoyed my ghetto soda de fresa y chile roja con chips - glad to see some things haven't changed.

This place is all right. Ive actually never eaten inside the restaurant, only outside or takeout. The burritos are pretty good. We almost always order the manual special burrito. Its pretty huge and can easily be shared with at least 4 peeps. Never order their menudo, it sucks. Its pretty much 99percent meat with no hominy.

This place is great!  Whoever puts lower than 4 stars, get out of the heart of Los Angeles and back to Beverly Hills.  This place has it all, great food, great staff, and one of the coolest owners, Manuel, who will definitely take a Tequila shot with you! This place is great for groups, and the food is massive.  Yes the "Regular burrito" is 9 dollars, but it feeds 2 to 3 people.  The portion sizes are massive for all their orders, and I have always enjoyed the taste of all their meats!  You cannot go wrong!  It has gotten busier but that's because of its popularity.  It was always this packed even before Man vs Food. Go check it out with your friends and make sure you are prepared to eat a Thanksgiving Mexican Meal!

I lost some respect for my fellow Yelpers on this one. It's not as if this place was really bad, but with over 700 reviews and an average of 4 stars, I expected a whole lot more. I hate leaving a bad review when everybody there was so nice, but I gotta keep it real for the sake of my Yelpers. Like I said, the service was great. The people were super nice and friendly. However, the food was less than okay. We ordered the Chili Verde burrito and Taquitos, which we were told was their specialty. Yeah, the servings are huge, but the meat for both the burrito and taquitos was really dry and hard. The sauce for the Chili Verde was nothing special. In all honesty, it tasted like a simple canned tomato sauce. They do give you a generous amount of guacamole, but it didn't make up for how bad the meat was. So, if you're really all about the size of the burrito, then this place is cool, but  a giant plate of crap, is still just a plate of crap at end of the day. I honestly would have given them just 2 stars based on the food alone, but gave them an extra one because they were so friendly and nice.

I read the reviews... well I saw the ratings on Yelp and decided I need to check this place out.  I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but I don't think it lived up to it's hype. Whenever I can, I like to try new Mexican places.  I'm on the hunt for the perfect carne asada.  That is how I gauge any Mexican restaurant.  If you cannot make me good Carne Asada, then I will most likely not be coming back. I ordered two dishes, the Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito (at the suggestion of the cashier) and Carne Asada Nachos, which is sort of my litmus test for whether or not a place makes good carne asada. First the Nachos: The steak itself was kind of dry, which I was not a fan of.  It was also sort of bland.  The way they do their nachos there is kind of plain.  It comes only with guacamole and sour cream, no cilantro or pico de gallo.  Also the texture of the chips they use bothered me.  They weren't stale exactly, but they were not crisp. As for the Hollenbeck Burrito:  This one I liked a little better, but again the steak was not that great.  The mixture of rice and peppers and what not inside the burrito made it a little better than it's nacho counterpart.   I will say this of both dishes.  They are BIG.  Though I guess for $10 each, they'd better be.  When I go on an eating binge, I usually eat a LOT, like a large pizza at a time.  Which is part of the reason I ordered two dishes.  I ate them for 3 meals that day and still have leftovers.  You definitely get your value that way.   I don't know, maybe I should've tried different dishes, but I was unimpressed with Manuel's.  It was not bad by any means, but after all the hype it received, I expected it to wow me a little more.  My search continues for a carne asada that will eventually dethrone the current King in my book, Chano's Drive Inn on 30th and Figueroa.

Manuel's Special ($20) can feed 3 really, really hungry people to the point of "OMG, I can't eat any more" or 4 people to the "satiated, just right" level. Or, it can also feed 1 person to the point of explosion. (When I was here on Saturday night, two guys ordered one each!) On the menu, it says carne asada will take an extra 15 minutes, but we didn't wait any longer than if we'd ordered a different meat. The chips here are thick and crunchy. I didn't really like the salsa (too much chipotle?) but the verde was good. Sides of guacamole are HUGE.

I love this place.  It is so cozy! I admit I was really scared coming here in the evening.  There were guys standing around suspiciously in the parking lot, but it turns out they were just helping their friend into a wheelchair.  Talk about not judging on first impressions! Once you're inside, everyone is so nice.  You feel like you're taken back in time when things were more simpler.  People next to us just made small talk with with no reservations.   We ordered for the Manuel's Pork Special for $19.50. It was HUGE!!! For first timers, this is a sight to see and try! =) The pork however was too thick and flavorless.  I would recommend paying a few extra bucks and getting a better meat. I will definitely come back and try their other items! =)

I got the Hollenbeck de Pollo and have to say that it was outstanding.   No problems at all (except potential angioplasty later).  The burrito was really, really good especially after a long hike where I ate nothing but raisins, fruit, and nuts the entire day.  Also, the service was just great considering that we walked in on Sunday at 8:30PM.   Guacamole-10/10 Burrito-10/10 Fried Chicken Taquitos - 9/10 Green Salsa 10/10 Red Sauce-good 9/10 Chips-too fucking full to eat but two of these -ok

Wonderful portions. I enjoyed the generous portions of guacamole I received on the side. The waitress sat down, talked to us, recommended some plates with a smile. The burrito I ordered was humongous. It was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty or too bland for my taste. I ate it all, but its okay, I can splurge once in a while. I felt like the place would start feeling a bit cramped but fortunately the good food and the attentive waiters helped to ease my worries. Great service Good food Nice atmosphere Good parking.

I came here with my family one day and it was PACKED as usual! If you're ever planning on coming here, don't expect a 5-10 min wait cause the norm here is approximately 20-30 mins on a GOOD day! El Tepeyac was one of the restaurants featured in Man V. Food, and as a result has gained a reputation for its ginormous portions of food! The best option I recommend is that you order take out! There's a separate line for "dine-in" and another line around the corner for "take out." The take out line is a lot faster and it's a lot more efficient especially if you're always on the go like myself! But let's get to the food. The portions here are HUGE and the prices are decent for the amount of food that you are getting. The people who work here are very generous and they are so friendly that they even let you sample some of their wide array of meats so that you can have a better "feel" on what you would want. I would highly recommend trying their Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito though! It is jam packed with succulent pieces of Carne Asada steak, with fresh pico de verde, onions, salsa, and fresh guacamole! It was so delicious! You should also try the Manuel Special but be warned because this is ONE HUGE BURRITO! It literally fed 4 grown adults and 2 kids and there was even a little bit leftover afterwards! Everything about the food here is great. The meat is nice and juicy, the salsas are fresh and there isn't a better place in East LA where you can get quality style burritos with these kind of portions! It's definitely a MUST TRY for any fan of Mexican food hands down!

Just because this was featured on Man vs Food it doesn't mean that is good! Mediocre Mexican-American food! Huge servings! Decent prices! Meat was hard, dry, and too salty.  The rice was too salty.  The chips had salt grains all over.  Salt! Salt! Salt!  It seems that the only spice they used was Salt!!  The guacamole dip had a rotten taste.  The corn tortillas were rough and tasted "cornless."

My soul cries every time I hear someone trash this place because it's not "authentic" or because "for Mexican food in LA, it sucks." I mean, even if those are true (an opinion that likely changes from person to person,) I don't really understand how at this stage in the game, people don't know what they're getting here. El Tepeyac is not about being on the cutting edge of Mexican food, or even really about being the best burrito in LA. It's about the atmosphere, the family feeling, the serving of Mexican comfort food (if you will) to the community, and of course, some damn huge portions that will feed one person several meals or a family of four all at once. Now, I'm not Mexican, so maybe I should shut my mouth, but really, there isn't a lot to not like here. I've been a lot, and sometimes the quality has been inconsistent, but never so much so that I wouldn't go back. I think people may hear all the hype about this place, and if it's not THE BEST THING EVER they are exceptionally disappointed. I feel that if people went to El Tep not expecting the Biblical experience that Adam Richman made it out to be on Man vs. Food (sorry Adam, but I do think you kind of oversold your performance a bit,) their expectations would be much more in line with what El Tepeyac is actually serving -- above average, but not stellar, Mexican food, and LOTS of it. Who can really argue with that?

My favorite restaurant, period. I've been coming here since I was born. I usually get the Manny's Special, all 8lbs of it. Glorious. If food was a woman, Manny's would be the most beautiful thing to ever grace the planet. I got to see Manny himself for the first time early this year. He gave me some tequila and was very friendly and chatted up my girlfriend (in a good way). He kicks ass. He's been running a badass joint forever. Anywho, not much else to say other than this is THE place to go. Been going here for nearly 30 years.

So one of my co-workers made me a list of Mexican places to try, and this was on the list. He seems like he knows what's up, so I decided to hit  up one of them, and that one happened to be Manuel's Original El Tepeyac Cafe. I phoned in an order for a Hollenbeck carne asada burrito, and picked it up on my way to work. The parking lot was packed, but there happened to be one last spot, so I parked in between some nice big black sedans. I could feel people watching as this Asian girl hopped out, passed a line of people waiting to get in, picked up her food, and drove off. Considering how popular this place seems, the restaurant is a little small, but it feels pretty homey, and the staff were really nice! All smiles and one worker opened the door for me when I entered and left. The burrito itself is gigantic! All my co-workers who passed by literally said "WOAH. You eating all that?" No, it was way too big for me, but it was delicious! Packed with meat and beans and rice and a ton of avocados in their guac! Talk about generous! And all for about $10. If that doesn't fill you up, go for their 5 lb burrito special. Pero tu eres loco if you can finish that!

You know that saying "Bigger is always better" in this case Manuel has made it his passion to surprise and make many people fans for his burritos. In no way do I come here and get a large burrito all by myself but they are delicious and very tasty! I like how much meat is packed into each one and the right amount of flavor is put in it! This place is tiny but I felt like I was actually in someones home sitting on a kitchen table. I really enjoyed that and having this experience. It makes me so happy that a small business is doing great and yes it is really good! I have tried both my friends burritos that they each ordered and boy they were awesome. I know some people like to have it by themselves but I just wouldn't be able to even get a 1/4 of it down. I like how fast the service went and the food came to us in a matter of minutes. If you are looking for a giant burrito with loads of flavor this is the place to come and check out! :) Manuel might be inside cooking up a storm or greeting customers soo check him out.

If it's on TV, of course everyone will flock there... Including me. A buddy of mine was visiting me in LA, and we were watching Man vs. Food: Los Angeles. Being a 'Barney Stinson', he of course proclaimed "CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!", and we headed out to try the Manuel Special. We decided to eat outside, where the line was minimal rather than to wait for a table inside. The line moved quickly, and a couple minutes later we were at the window to order our gargantuan burrito. Each of us ordered one, as my buddy was not willing to share. He was determined to eat that burrito himself. When asked how many plates I would be needing, I scoffed and went "PLATES?!". The lady gave me a "You can't hang.." sort of look, and proceeded to ring up my order. It took a little while for our food to be ready, but we expected that, considering how busy the place was inside, and the quantity of animals they would have to slaughter to fill that burrito. When we got our food, it was shocking to see the burrito up close. I knew this would be a self-imposed challenge even my buddy couldn't win, and I think he knew it too. The burrito was delicious, the perfect ratio of meat to fillings, and I very quickly was defeated. It was a good defeat, as I was satisfied in my choice to get the mainstream burrito. I wish now that I had ordered something that wasn't featured on a "how to get fat quick" TV show, and rather tried something else, but... live and learn. Just means that I will be going back again. The embarrassing part was going back to the window to ask the same lady for a box, at which she laughed at me and I sauntered back to my table with my tail between my legs. P.S. My buddy couldn't hang either..Challenge failed...

I saw this place randomly when I was chanel surfing and landed on the show "Man Vs Food" on the travel chanel. The episode is all about places in Los Angeles. As I was watching, I saw this place and their Manuel's special (their 5 pound buritto)!!!! Their food in general looked amazing. And the owner, Manuel, look like a major flirt but super sweet because he greeted you with a shot of tequilla! Cant ask for anything else. So I grabbed my girlfriend, and we went on a mission to this place! When we arrived, let me say the neighborhood wasnt super clean but i expected that. The owner wasnt there but we did get our shots! Yum! And my girlfriend and I ordered their special. Yes, it was 5 pounds but at $18 it was a bargain. We were stuffed, and couldnt move. Everyone was super friendly. The place itself was tiny, but had many tables, which was all filled. What do you expect from a random LA eatery?! The place was clean, but needed someone to just clean the tables because the empty ones were dirty. At the end, on the way out, we ordered another one of this massive buritto because we had to have our family try this...or have it be our lunch for the next day LOL. All in all, if you are in the area and want an amazing low key experiance then I would stop by.

This place is the real deal.  If you want good, authentic LA-style mexican food, huge portions, and not looking to spend a lot, you cannot get any better than this.  There might be a wait, and you might feel rushed or cramped in their tiny, East LA dining room, but if you're willing to put these small inconveniences aside for a burrito like no other, then El Tepeyac is worth the trip. The only thing that's truly worth ordering off the menu is the Original Hollenbeck Burrito, but get it with pork.  I got mine with shredded beef, which was really good nonetheless, but was blindsided by the promise of accompanying ingredients (e.g. cheese, guacamole, jalapeños, eggs) to complement the beef.  The pork burrito in comparison looked way more delicious and had larger chunks of the meat inside instead of scattered out and around the meal. But you really can't go wrong with anything here.  Just expect large portions and a doggy back to take back the half of your burrito that you end up not eating.  And if you come here on a good day in the middle of the week: a line to get in.

I've been coming here with my parents since I was a kid. As I got older, the burritos got smaller. Nonetheless, I still can't finish a burrito by myself. My favorite is the machaca burrito, which I always share. It's full of shredded meat, beans, it's cheesy and delicious. Sometimes it comes with a salad, sometimes it doesn't. I don't understand why the cooks aren't consistent. I will be honest, I have not tried much else on the menu but I believe you can't really go wrong. The food is ready fairly quickly which is a bonus considering that this place is ALWAYS busy. Chips and salsa are not free, regardless of whether you eat in or take the food to go. That's REALLY lame. I went today and our waitress was kinda nice but at the same time made you feel like you were inconveniencing her by asking for....water. Yeah water. The food was delicious, but the experience could've been more pleasant.   Overall this place has good food at somewhat decent prices. But like my sister said today, it is overrated...just a bit. I will admit however, that my experience was soured because of the customer service INDOORS. The food itself is delicious and I realize that is what people want. PS. I really wish the people who live next door would sell their house. That way the restaurant could expand and perhaps improve the eat in experience.

Very tiny place with Big food.  You will want to order the Burrito, but make sure you share.   My girl has been going here for years and rarely has she seen anyone finish one plate by themselves in one sitting. Heat factor is here as well as the joy and flavor in the cooking.

Saturday afternoon spent with two of the biggest burritos in the world (with 5 other dudes)! The 6 of us ordered two Special burritos (Steak Picada and Chile Verde) and sodas/horchatas.  Price is definitely affordable since it came out to about $60.   The food was mediocre.  The size of the thing is amazing and even while you're eating it, it's heftier than it looks.  They drench the burritos in sauce and cheese and extra chunks of meat.  But I feel like the size of the thing works against it.  The flavor was okay at best.  I've had wet burritos that were more flavorful.  But overall, the burrito is still delicious and easily fills you up. I'd give this place 4 stars but the waitress was .... not nice.  I specifically asked the lady behind the counter for a receipt because the meal was going to get comped, and she happily said they always give receipts.  Then the waitress comes and tells me to sit down at the table in a snappy tone so she could help us.  I didn't even know they have waitresses at the outside tables.  Then the waitress took my receipt and ended up losing it.  She tried to lie by saying that they don't give receipts.  Come on now.... ruined a perfectly good trip to Manny's....

Came in on a lovely Wed. at 11:00 am & this restaurant was already fully packed! Luckily, I had already called in to order, so there was no need for me to wait. I bought a carne asada hollenbeck burrito, split for 2, and it was more than enough for my brother and I. By far theeee best burrito that I've had in California, and I'm not from around here. The only ones I've tried before were: King Taco, Alfredos, & Albertos??? And they're all hmm...not as good as Manny's. Maybe it's because they add the guacamole inside the burrito that makes it all gooey and yummy? Since the texture wouldn't be as thick as beans? I don't know what it is exactly but it's a lot of goodness up in that burrito. I will definitely come back for more! :-)

How can you not fall in love with a little, old man that offers you a shot of tequila right when you sit down? Manny you are so adorable I just want to put you in my pocket!! I couldn't turn him down and that's how my experience at El Tepeyac started. Shots shots shots! I got the Steak Picado burrito and it was so good. The steak was so tender and the sauce was amazing. The thing was massive and I could barely gobble down half. The only bad thing I can say is that I felt like crap after. Food coma like a mofo. I knocked out in the car and could definitely feel my heart slow and blood thicken from all the unhealthy food I consumed. There's no way you can eat anything after. Despite the near heart attack, I do want to come back and try something other than a burrito. I wonder how Manny stays so thin with the food he serves...

Went to El Tepeyac for the first time in over a year last night.  I was happy to see there was a new menu board at the take out window.  It was easy to read and find what you are looking for.  I was however a bit disappointed to find the prices had gone up across the board. We ordered a Manuel's Burrito with machata for the family to share.  When we got it, it seemed to be smaller than it use to be.  Since we had to drive back to Inland Empire, we didn't break into it for another hour.  As soon as we got home we opened up and dug right in.  The flavor was fantastic as usual but as suspected, the burrito was smaller.   Now I know if I want to feed my HUGE family of 11, I need to buy 2 of them but at almost $25.00 a piece, it's not going to happen anytime soon or very often.

After a meeting this Friday afternoon on the Eastside my friend and I stopped at El Tepeyac Cafe because there was a small line. Long lines kept me from sampling in the past so I took advantage today. Our lunch included: A side of guacamole and chips. The guacamole was flavored with fresh avocado, onion and cilantro layered on a basket of their deliciously-greasy-crunchy chips. The Manuel Special - this ginormous burrito is a beast. Inside included beans, rice, carne asada, guacamole, and cheese. On top, mounds of chili sauce and cheese. Seriously, the burrito is the size of Lebron James's forehead (that's big!) Trying to eat this thing in a car is ridiculous. WTH was I thinking?? You cannot pick it up so that meant knife and forking it. The flavor of this large burrito was good - not bland like some of the reviewers noted...messy, but good.   Trying not to look like a pig in front of my friend, I only finished half of the thing.  Still a feat if you ask me. My friend is from the area and shared her usual enchilada plate. The red sauce over the enchiladas was tasty and not watered-down. It had a strong, dark chili taste to it that I liked. The depth of flavors the sauce had was quite refreshing. Underneath all that sauce and cheese were huge chunks of beef - tender and moist. I enjoyed my first visit to El Tepeyac Cafe, the food is good but nothing stellar except the portions. The owner's personality alone earns them high marks - over 50 years in business says a lot.

In my town there is nothing but cookie cutter Mexican food places that are worthless and not even worth an honorable mention. But if I go to my grandmother's  stomping ground where she was a crazy and wild young woman cruising Brooklyn Avenue looking for men who looked like Desi Arnaz, I would have Manuel's El Tepeyac to eat. El Tepeyac will forever remind me of my grandmother and all her stories about Manuel and El Tepeyac that goes back many many years. Hi Grandma! Anyways, I love to hear her stories and it makes me like the restaurant even more. OK back to the food. It's the best Mexican food you can find. The best I have ever eaten. I love the Hollenbeck with cheese (yes, it comes with cheese and this is the way you should order it). It is glorious and the guacamole along with the meat and ranchero sauce is delicious. I love the food--my mom ate nothing but El Tepeyac when I was in her stomach so I am forever doomed to love it hahaha. When I went the other day with my dog friend LUCY aka LUCIA, Tracy the outside waitress was just about the nicest waitress I have ever come across. She is so good to everyone (even the cholos) and deserves an honorable mention.

I just happened  to be working down the street from El Tepeyac. I decided to stop by and get something for lunch, and I simply asked for a carne asada burrito. Simple Right!!!!! I mean how could you mess up and when you think of carne asada you think carne ranchera not chunks of fat and no flavor what so ever. The tortilla was cold and I had to ask them to warm it up again. They told me it was because I was outside. Last time I checked it was 90 degrees outside.  The thing that was semi- decent was the salsa. They should have called that burrito chuck wagon steak burrito with plenty of fat. The beans tasted like Rosarito Beans straight from the can.I have never been to a place so disgusting, overpriced, and in the heart of the hood, like this Mexican place.

El Tepeyac? More like, El Tepeyuck. Overrated, over-sized burritos. I tried chicken, steak and pork. All the meat was dry, and the sauce for the okie style was not appetizing. A friend threw up after lunch and another threw away half a Manuel Special because of the dry meat and lack of taste. This restaurant is for those seeking quantity and not quality.

I swung into this place after my friend referred new to try it saying this is his most favorite burrito in all the land. I got a carne asada burrito and was floored at its massive size and the ungodly amount of guacamole they throw on (a huge plus), but I was a bit upset that you can't pick it up and have to opt for a fork like an open faced sandwich...but burrito.

This place is great. It is a real L.A. institution. There was a line out of the door, but the wait wasn't that long. Everyone was friendly and we had great conversations. Some people might get scuuurred because of the different types of people, and it is in East Los, but to me these are normal people. I had the Hollenbeck de pollo, and my fiancee had the Hollenbeck de carnitas. I found the chicken to be tender and flavorful. This burrito lasted me 2.5 meals, and I am a big eater. My fiancee loved the carnitas, she said it was tender and tasty. Since I don't eat pork, I can't tell you. The chips were fresh, and I loved the salsa. If your cooooollll, Manny himself will give you a shot or two.... or three or four of tequila.

Me & the Mrs shared the Original (with pork) along with a single chicken taco + guacamole & chips. Everything delicious. Great food. HUGE portions! Very nice service. There's not much to this place I can share, which hasn't already been shared on the Travel Channel. (Thanks Adam). The place is exactly as advertised. It's small and quests need to wait outside, but that wasn't an issue for us. We actually met Manuel briefly.. he seems just as eccentric as I'd have expected. If you'd like to mark this off your 'Foodie' check-list, you can do it pretty cheaply and in-out pretty quick (all things considered). It's worth the revisit if you have out of town guests.... ALTHOUGH - the food wasn't beyond this world spectacular and not any different than the majority of other 'quality' Mexican restaurants in the LA area. Enjoy!

My friend and I were going down to Los Angeles for the day to do some shopping and whatever.  My dad recommended this place.  We thought it sounded good, so we went, parked, and waited... waited for 30 long minutes outside, in the hot southern California sun.  after FINALLY getting a seat inside, we sat right next to the juke box, the server brought us our drinks and some chips, and we took a look at the menu.  My dad recommended the Hollenbeck burrito, so, we both ordered that.  While we waited, we munched on chips and salsa, which was pretty damn good.  I totally dig places that do chips in salsa, especially when it's free, especially when the chips are fresh, and especially when the salsa is rockin'.  I then turned my attention to the juke box that was RIGHT behind me.  After browsing through it, I found that Led Zeppelin IV was on there.  Not my favorite Zeppelin album, but they ARE my favorite band, so, I put the money in and played the entire album.  good stuff. The burrito had finally arrived, and it was massive.  one of the largest burritos I've ever seen... then... we dove in.  I added some of that rockin' salsa I mentioned earlier to the burrito which was a pretty good idea.  Everything on it tasted excellent.  The meat was great, and so was everything else on the burrito... it was quite incredible... but a bit TOO filling.  by the time "When the Levee Breaks" started playing, I had gotten 3 quarters of the way done.  My god.  another bite could NOT be had.  A burp of satisfaction was had (in a mannerful fashion of course) and I then gave up.  My friend however, finished his burrito.  props to him. El Tepeyac was excellent.  Really good food, great employees (our server kept our glasses full, which is a must for carne asada. I swear I always need to drink after taking a few bites), prices weren't INSANE, but a tiny tiny bit high.  like, 15 a person or something?  but  whatever.  money is no object.  I'd certainly go back.  I loved this place.  very small restaurant too, but I like that kind of thing.  it was quite busy when we went in, and it just kind of added to the atmosphere somehow.  EVERY table was full of people having a good time.  Families, business people on their lunch break, all kinds of people just having a good time, enjoying some swell food.  pretty loud in there, but again, i enjoyed that.  something about it just made the experience perfect.

So for a while my friends from Pasadena wanted to try some authentic mexican food north of the country itself. So being from east LA i though of El Tepeyac. Suprisingly i had never been there so i was actually looking forward to it just as much as they were. I think we went on a Sunday evening. Being a popular place of course there was a line but  only waited 15-20 min(not too shabby). We ordered the massive burrito everyone talks about and let me tell you: that's one BIG burrito. Despite the size it was really good, cooked just right and the seasonings/herbs were on point. I definately recommend this place. The price was reasonable and the service was good. The only setback is how small the place is. We were a group of 8 and were crammed in the corner. I wish they expanded the place but chances are is "what you see is what you get". I do suggest you get there early on wknd's since chances are you'll be waiting outside for a while. Enjoy the food and my backyard known as East LA!

So i ventured to this place only because i wanted to be greeted with a shot and have really good Mexican food... double negative I had the Carne Asada Hollenbeck beans, rice, sauce, guac, and was mildly enthused about the flavor... it was bland and lack pop My friend had the chiliquiles and these were enormous and bland as well...basically the first time I've ever seen him put salt on anything. I did order the chips and guac- and those were d lish! nice and salty and greasy and the guac was filled with flavor and the cilantro hint was perfect. Our service was not friendly when we sat at the bar top it was like pulling teeth or flaggin someone down, the ladies were almost pissed we were there eating. I had the horchata which was watered down and not enough cinnamon in it to give it that zing. As we sit the gentleman which look like Manuel's son was hugging all over the waitresses and well never said i once to us. I was disappointed in this whole experience, i don't know if I would be back to try something different.

My friend's mom used to get the giant burrito here and it was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten in my life. However, the last two times changed it all from that first experience. We would kind of pitch in to get the burrito now and order it. The last two times I got it, it tasted a bit bland and the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. Also, the drinks for this place is real pricey. $2.75 for a 20 oz is pricey and tasted ok. However, the good part is that the burrito is good to feed like more than 10 people and it's somewhat worth the price. A decent place to get a big share of food, but not a place I will go often.

This place is a Los Angeles icon.  While most people think of the Hollywood sign or Grauman's Chinese Theater or the Watts Towers as Los Angeles icons, this place defines Los Angeles to foodies in more than one way. Manuel was an awesome guy when I met him.  I can't recall if he gave me tequila (he probably did, but I forgot), but that is his welcoming tradition here - that and the line that always goes down Evergreen Avenue at every waking hour.  The interior is small, but it historic - it shows Manuel's humble beginnings as well as his restaurant's rise to prominence. I tried Manuel's Special, which is a five-pound burrito topped with salsa and stuffed with pork.  I wasn't too thrilled with pork after I finished the burrito (I couldn't finish the entire plate, but I was happy that I ate what I did), but it was a decent burrito that failed to separate itself for anything else I've ever had until about 2/3 through the burrito.  From there, the burrito was horrible, especially the salsa.  Looking back, it wasn't too bad, but I don't understand why it's so revered in East L.A. If you want to dine here, prepare yourself for a wait.  However, I've tasted better pork burritos here in Ohio (unfortunately).  I'd go back just to see if the 5-pound burrito with steak would taste any better (knowing my love of steak, it should), but the challenge will only count if you eat the whole burrito with pork - just a heads up.  I respect Manuel as a person and respect Manuel's restaurant for what he's done, but it unfortunately was unable to take me to culinary nirvana.

Ok...so after watching Man v Food, I needed to put this on my list as well to try. I sure as hell wasn't going to attempt the challenge, but was going to try one of their famed burritos. First, driving through East LA...my husband said - "Where the hell is this restaurant? We're in East LA!"  I didn't know where I was going, I was just going where Adam Rich ate! When we got there, there was a line waiting outside for inside dining.  I told my brother-in-law to peek around the corner because I saw several people going in and out there with bags...and yup - there was a take out window where you can choose to eat in the back patio or take your food to go. The menu was exactly the same! I needed to know the difference between hollenback and okie style burritos.  Okie was apparently red sauce, and the hollenback was green chile.  So you choose your prefrence. I ordered a regular burrito which was still enormous!  My husband and I shared the okie machacha (tender shredded and flavorful beef).  I've never seen a burrito so loaded with meat.  I almost didn't see my rice and other stuff inside because it was so full of meat.  We both barely finished the burrito because it was so big...I can't imagine the size of the manual's special! My sister ordered the beef stew burrito that again, had chucks of savory and tender beef.  My son had the carne asada, my brother-in-law had the chicken okie (but his chicken was a little bland). In addition,we shared a small order or menudo that was so delicious. This is a must for mexican food in LA.  You have to try it...and see it to believe it.  Portions are huge!  come with an appetite or plan on sharing.

I honestly have to say that I don't have any issues with the restaurant, and I really liked the down-to-earth ambiance. But the food itself was a little bit of a disappointment - what it offered in quantity, it didn't make up for in quality. For two we ordered the Hollenbeck de Machaca burrito and the 2 Enchiladas in Red sauce combo. The Machaca wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, and the sauce that topped the enchiladas was just too overpowering. There wasn't much guacamole in either of the entrees. Overall I'm glad I tried the place. As an FYI there are two lines - one for eating in the restaurant, and one for getting take-out, where you can eat at one of their outdoor seats if you want. The food comes out pretty quick in the restaurant, so it really just depends on which line is shorter, and if there's outdoor seating available.

Holy Manuel's Special!  2 to 4 people my butt! All the other reviews pretty much said what need to be said.  Must have the tortilla chips here.  Super fresh and delish! Very cramped restaurant.  Very welcoming staff.  Not sure about the hygiene here; reason why for the 4 star.

Learned of El Tepeyac through a friend. I wasn't aware of the publicity it received from Man vs. Food until researching it. I support independently owned restaurants getting a lot of attention from the food & travel shows.   I hadn't actually seen the show though, so I was still surprised by the size of my small, basic Original Hollenbeck burrito.  I had stayed clear of the Manuel burrito's that say they are good fro 2-3 people or the Foot Long Manuel burritio's that say good for 6-8 people.  My small,basic Original Hollenbeck burrito was easily large enough to feed two. The Original Hollenbeck has pork chile verde topping the burrito (the other Hollenbeck's have the meat on the inside.  Erin ordered an Okie Machacha (shreadded seasoned beef) burrito and Marc ordered a Hollenbeck Carne Asada burrito. I didn't learn what Hollenbeck and Okie mean, but the Hollenbeck is a wet burrito with a green sauce and Okie is a wet burrito with a red sauce. The Okie Machacha was the big hit at our table and I recommend you try it.  Kelly ordered a chile relleno that was tasty too. No cervezas at El Tepeyac so that helps keep the bill down.  The house made tortilla chips were appreciated. We were fortunate and arrived immediately before a long line (4-5 tables, 10-14 people) queued up behind us.  We ate on a Sunday night.  Go expecting a wait.  If you do not want to wait to dine in, El Tepeyac offers a take out window.

I've been going to El Tepeyac (or "Manuel's" as we know it) since I was a fetus.  It wasn't until decades later that I realized that many people viewed it as a novelty Mexican restaurant.  When people outside of East L.A. talk about it, they speak of it like it's the prototypical Mexican restaurant.  Geez, what pressure!  The food is great.  Its notorious burritos are amazing.  But like anything else, it can be over-hyped.  So try to temper your anticipation and don't build unrealistic expectations that can't be met.   I usually don't order the burritos.  They're just too big, and I'm gluttonous, which results in an awful stomach ache.  And besides, everyone already knows about the burritos.  I like the taquitos.  Hard shell filled with chunks of pork (or chicken if you prefer) and fresh guacamole.  Sometimes I get the Kiko's Special, which is a plate of red chile enchiladas with a fried egg on top ...fried eggs make everything better!.   Expect a line (outside, so bring a jacket).  Service is usually rushed, but you'll totally understand after having stood in line.  No alcohol (thank goodness.  or else you'd be standing in line outside forever!).     My only complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa.  It really pisses me off that chips are extra even when you order a side of guacamole.  I love avocados but, c'mon, I'm not gonna eat it with a fork.  or at least not in public.  :P

I ate here about 15 years ago when driving thru LA on the way to San Diego.  The people I was with said, "It's the best Mexican food on the planet!"  They were right.  I had dreams about it afterward and never forgot.   Yesterday, I took my husband there for lunch and told him the same thing.  He agreed that it was absolutely amazing!  We split a regular burrito and still took half of it home in a box for tonight's dinner!  We are stuffed AGAIN and will be dreaming about the awesomeness.  Thankfully, we now live within 20 minutes of this gem!

He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food Raymond Chandler I grew for a time in my childhood in East Los Angeles, in Boyle Heights, next to the Aliso Projects near the LA River, across which you could reach Little Tokyo in a 30-minute walk.  I played baseball for the Union Church Saints in the Evergreen League where our games were played at Evergreen Park, not far from the legendary El Tepeyec For a period in my life, El Tepeyec was the greatest restaurant in the universe.  In reality, it was a modest, small restaurant that did most of its business through a take-out window. It was established in the early 1950's, but serves up some of the best burritos of all time.   The burritos here are huge, packed with quality ingredients, and are smothered in a wet sauce.  I like the Hollenbeck Burrito, which is packed with rice, beans, guacamole, and pork.  The Manuel Burrito is another signature item.   The menu has been expanded and includes additional items such as enchiladas, chorizo and eggs, tacos, and menudo.  Their taquitos with guacamole are among the best taquitos I've ever eaten. I consider El Tepeyec a landmark restaurant.  It's great to eat here even if some of the legendary qualities of its past have fallen by the wayside. Don't be squeamish about eating in a restaurant in a tough, East LA neighborhood.  Don't go to the El Tepeyec in Monterey Park - go to the original El Tepeyec in East LA: burritos always taste better in the barrio...

Dang, I can't believe I haven't even heard of this place until recently! I'm up in LA pretty much every week and wish I woulda found out about this place before. My friend seen this place on the food network and went to check it out and he was ranting and raving a lot of good things about this place so I decided to give it a shot myself last Monday. El Tepeyac isn't too hard to find as its right in the middle of a residential street in the 'hood of East LA, so that was a good sign that this spot will be good!  Being a native San Diegan, we are spoiled with taco shops all over each corner of the city and the ones in the 'hood are always a lot more bomb and hooked up fatter! ;P I came here around 8:30pm-ish and noticed this place still had a good amount of people inside.  I was on the way back down to SD and decided to just grab it to go at the side window outside the restaurant. Looking into the kitchen from the outside, it appeared this place was family owned from everyone who was working. Seemed like chaos inside, as they were stacking order after order of burritos for people dining in and for some peeps waiting outside. They made some of the biggest burritos I've seen in quite a while, prob enough to feed 3-4 people, LOL! I knew I would not be able to finish that so I opted for the Hollenbeck burrito.  It was also quite large and I barely finished half of it before getting bloated.  Must have been the smooth and thick horchata that I downed before I started to eat the burrito. I have to say that their horchata is one of the best I've drank in a minute! It wasn't watered down and powdery like others and went down good! If your in LA, this place is a must visit! ;)

Well, here we are in ELA again and we just made another trip to El Tepeyac.  This place has been around for more than 50 years and  I'm sure most of the customers have been going here since they wre kids. This is my standard for Mexican restaurants---down-home, huge portions, lots of locals and families, friendly staff, fun ambiance, and fantastic juke box. It is still teeny but if you go on an off hour like we did you can walk right in and have a seat. This time it is just the hubby and I.  He ordred his usual-a veggie burrito (massive).  I got two taquitos that came with at least a cup of guacamole plus lettuce and tomatoes. We also ordered chips and quacamole. I had to take one taquito "home" (motel home) with me.  Our sweet waitress gave me two tubs of salsa togo with it. I love seeing the changing pix of family members on the walls. My late dad used to have long chats with the owner.  So I always think of him when I come here too.  He was a very friendly guy.

Let me get this straight: 'HUGE portions' merit the authenticity-stamp for Mexican joints?? *sigh* This place is as authentic as Knott's Berry Farm's Montezuma's Revenge snack-bar. Maybe I'm spoiled by the regional Piasa joints that don't cater to LA nostalgia but I don't trust any Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve Asada, Carnitas or Pastor meat. Iceberg lettuce!?? *shakes head* After all the hype from my newly extended East-Los familia and fellow die-hard Dodger fans, Its safe to say I was disappointed by TepeWac's condensed, portion-friendly menu. I agree, not ALL 'authentic' Mexican joints serve the same type of food, but they DO serve a protein other than thawed-out chicken strips and Shredded beef(Machaca).

Manuel, your burrito is so special to me. It's so big I don't think I can even wrap both of my hands around your massive girth. I thought two mouths would be enough to take you down but I was wrong. You are just too much to handle. Way too juicy and way too hot! They say you are big enough to feed two people, but you are massive enough for three mouths. It's just so muy grande! The way your juices dripped down my hands as I was taking you in my mouth... I was so relieved when the cream finally came. And such a mountain of a load you unleashed onto my table with a thud, commanding attention. You gave me a full scoop of your lovely sour cream! You looked just like a bowlful of vanilla ice cream on a hot summer day. We order this monstrous burrito suited for 2-3 people and they must weigh about 2 pounds each. I should know I couldn't breathe after eating here and my already loose dress was suddenly two sizes too small. I want to say the Manuel's special burrito base is a thick and rich meat stew. The beef was absolutely tender and slick with juices: a delicious stock made from beef, tomatoes, bell peppers and other veggies. Amazing! 5 Stars! The tortilla chips were stale. Boo! 1 Star. Side of sour cream was seriously a bowlful but the perfect accompaniment to the burrito! I like my burritos a little creamy. Manuel, you were just so good that lazy Sunday afternoon. I have to see you again... Burrito for two, one soda, a side of sour cream and a side of tortilla chips came out to $30.

The world's most perfect salsa exists here.  I know, I know, I bet your momma or your abuelita or your tia makes an incredible salsa.  Mine do too.  I think what happened at Tepeyac is that they combined all the incredible salsas that moms, abuelitas and tias made and decided to serve it and call it theirs.  Pretty brilliant if you think about it.   Enchiladas were delicious, the guacamole was good, but it needed salt.  The jamaica was so so good!  Not too sweet and the perfect way to wash down all the deliciousness that is Tepeyac. FYI, don't go on a Tuesday 'cause their closed and you don't know disappointment until you see the "Closed" sign of a restaurant you've been dying to try.  Not that I know personally.  I'm just sayin'.

Was a decent place when prices were cheaper and you got value for your dollar for bland tasting food, but since the prices have risen i don't think its worth eating here. Overhyped burrito has chunks of meat that look like Alpo - what someone would feed their dog.   cheap quality I know lots of people will disagree with me on this opinion, but i'm 'real talk.'  Quantity doesn't equate Quality.

There's just something I love about fried eggs, especially when it's fried to the point that the white edges are browned and yet the yolk still retains some of its liquid gold. Sometimes a fried egg sandwich on lightly buttered toasted bread is all I need for a satisfying meal. Why all the egg talk? When it comes to dining out, I always seem to be drawn to dishes that feature fried eggs, whether it's fried quail eggs on scallops or fried eggs on pizza. So when I was out with friends to dinner at El Tepeyac, a restaurant icon in East LA, I had a hard time deciding what to order. Finally, something finally caught my attention and made my palate say "Ole!" Do you know what that was? Well, it certainly wasn't taquitos. My one dish quickie at El Tepeyac were the Beef Enchiladas topped with Fried Eggs. When I finally got my order, I looked down and then I immediately looked around to see who'd be willing to share this dish with me. It was huge, but so were a lot of the other dishes ordered by my companions. I was definitely on my own. Fork in hand, I cut into egg and enchilada and was happy to see the yolk gushing out. My first bite was delicioso. Granted, your doctor probably wouldn't recommend a steady diet of melted cheese, beef and eggs, but for that moment, I didn't care. Now is this the best enchilada I ever had, even with the fried egg? Probably Not. Would I go out of my way to return to El Tepeyac just for this dish? Not really. But for that moment, it was tasty, filling and hit the spot. Of course, whenever I go to into a Mexican restaurant in the future, I just might have to see if the chef would be willing to take a special request - fried egg on enchilada, anyone?

HOLY BURRITO. So, yes, I'm obsessed with Man Vs. Food. I have a crush on Adam Richmand. I find him freakishly attractive. So, yes, I ended up here, since he was feeling the love. I did not order the Manuel special, I do not have the stomach to handle that. I did order the Okie burrito, in hopes that it would be smaller. Um, psych. Their "normal" burritos are still literally bigger than both of my hands and are gigantic.   Really guys, really? Ah, but then, I managed to take a bite, and the clouds parted. This is effing awesome. This is one of the best authentic wet burritos I've ever had (and I had two today... I'm pretty sure I'm just made of burritos and beer at this point).   The meat is perfectly marinated and the way it blends with the rice and everything it's just... perfect. I'll be back way more when I'm down in LA again.

Meh. Yeah, it's huge, but my burrito seriously had no flavor. Tasted like store-bought guac and canned chicken. No hot sauce or salsa to doctor it up- and the staff was pretty rude. I saw this place on Man v. Food and thought it looked amazing. Unfortunately El Tepeyac didn't live up to the hype- at all.

Not a huge fan, but it's still not bad. The food seems to be a lot more bland than I remember 10 years ago when I used to go, the ingredients, although not bad, used to be a lot more different, maybe even fresher and the meat was tastier and juicier. It could be because now they have a whole lot more clientele which means more demand and with the way this shitty economy is they may have had to cut cost and turn a profit who knows. Any way like I said, not too high on the food, but the service is great, the tequila while you wait in line is great and the prices are pretty good too.

We came here directly after our YELP bball event...  http://www.yelp.com/even… We also saw it on man v. food, where Adam Richman highly recommended it.   There was a long line out the door, which we bypassed by ordering outside.  We ordered the Hollenbeck burrito, steak fries, and a large diet coke. Even though Princess and I shared this delicious meal, we were still leaving with two huge take-out boxes full of burrito guts and freshly fried fries.

It's been a while since we've eaten here. My husband's a foodie channel watcher.  He saw El Tepeyac featured on Man vs. Food (one of his favorite programs) & has had the Manuel's Special on his brain the last few days. I'm a sickie today, so he went to get take-out.  The Manuel's Special for him & the veggie burrito for me.  He said the owner, Mr. Rojas, was out on the patio being personable with the crowd.  There was a young asian couple who he suspected were Yelpers because they were taking pictures of everything & posing with the owner.  Even at 2pm, the place was busier than usual.  Probably because of the TV exposure? I don't remember the veggie burrito being THAT big!  It's going to take me until tomorrow to eat this!  So good, lots of guacamole.  I forgot to tell my husband to ask them to go light on the cheese.  So our doggie got a treat too. My husband got through 3/4 of his burrito & is now lying down on the couch, rubbing his belly & groaning about over-eating. Price-wise....Almost $26 for the two burritos.  Not complaining though.

Split the Hollenbeck with Carne Asada. Good amount for two, but way too much for one. The meat was honestly kinda greasy, but the peppers made up for it! Definitely a dive and definitely out of the way but a fun LA experience none-the-less. And, you won't walk away hungry.

This restaurant was amazing. The servers were friendly, the draft was cheap enough for the pitchers, happy hour is great, and the atmosphere is friendly for family and friends. The Hollenbeck burrito is amazing in that it's gigantic for ten dollars. It doesn't get better for the price. I tried to eat it all to myself, and simply couldn't. I should have split it with one other person on the table. The only reason that I gave it a four star instead of a five is that the carnitas wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. By no means was it bad, I've just had better.

This place is the SH*T, I kid you not. When I was a little kid, my papa would take my mom and I here at least once a year.  It was a bit of a drive from Long Beach to East L.A., but TOTALLY worth it.  Usually we'd head there for an early dinner after spending the afternoon downtown.  JewelryMart, anyone? As a littl'n, it greatly impressed me that this little place in a (relatively) quiet neighborhood would have the best tasting Mexican food, all served as quickly as possible with little to no fanfare.  You wait to get in, you sit, you order, you eat, and you get the hell out of there so the next person waiting could eat. THEY DON'T MESS AROUND AT EL TEPEYAC. My favorite dish is the cheese enchilada plate. YUMMERS.  Cheese is a food group, didn't you know? God, I gotta head out here again next time I drive down to SoCal to visit the parents. By the way, my papa worked in a family-owned Mexican restaurant for several years back in the day. His job was to make menudo.  This means you can trust my taste in Mexican food.

Never tried the burrito.  I'm a taco afficiando whose always searching for the best L.A. has to offer.  Well, at least among the non-authentic versions.  (For authentic, see: Mariela's)  Found it here.  I always get the beef taco/cheese enchilada combo plate and order an a la carte chicken taco.  I may as well ask for a to-go container before the waitress leaves.  What is it that my mother used to say?  Oh.  My eyes are bigger than my stomach. Tacos: delicately crisp shell loaded to capacity with shredded, flavorful beef or chicken, topped with lots of cold, tasty cheddar, sprinkled with salty white Cotija cheese.  Even the lettuce has a certain tastiness to it. Enchilada:  A folded over tortilla package stuffed and surrounded with rich, cheddar doing the backstroke in a perfect, not too spicy red sauce. Rice and beans: Tasty and delicious and not stale, as is my frequent experience elsewhere.  These rice and beans are the primary reasons why I can't fit out the door when we leave. I think we sat at a table exactly once.  It was on a Sunday, the time I had my first bowl of menudo.  (Not too shabby.)  Otherwise, we skip the line and head straight to the counter, where we can enjoy the pleasant family photos that cover the walls as we wait (not too long) for our meal. Oh, and unless they've changed their policy: it's cash only.  Call first to make sure, 'cause I haven't been there for a while.

I don't usually like to share my food, but I'll make an exception here. I came here for a friends birthday...note to everyone out there, this is not a good place to go if you have a large party. How they arranged the table was a fire hazard. It was crazy. The person at the end of the table had to keep moving because people needed to pass by to go to the restroom. Not good. The whole hype is about the size of their burritos, which really is giant. Its burritos on steroids. The tortilla has to be massive to wrap this thing. They must have gallons of sauce prepared as well. It's insane. In my opinion the burrito was good. It wasn't the best. I was expecting worse just because of the monstrous size.

LOTS of hype about this place. Adam Richman and his Man vs Food has came through here. I mean, they even have pictures of Danny Trejo, the star from many Robert Rodriguez flicks including Machete stopping by. My buddy picked up some take out for us for Super Bowl Sunday. What better else to have bomb Mexican food while watching one the greatest sports game played. Unfortunately, El Tepeyac didn't execute like a champ. It's more like a playoff team that gets knocked out in the first series. The portions here are ridiculous. When you pay for a $10+ burrito, you're probably going to ask wtf are you paying for? It's a damn a burrito. They rationalize the price with the amount they give you. Even a giant lineman would smile. I shared a burrito and we both weren't able to tackle it. The taste to me was a bit bland. I had to douse my food with the different salsa and hot sauces. It just didn't have that real Mexican street food magic that I was hoping to find. Maybe they went too mainstream? I wouldn't be able to tell you. Personally, I rather pay $10 for a bomb smaller burrito than a ginormous bland burrito that I lost my appetite for in the middle of my meal. I can now say I have tried this place & knock it off my bookmark list. It wasn't out of this world nor was it horrible but I can surely live without it. Back to the Mexican street vendors where they hardly speak a lick of English. Orale'.

Guacamole Torta burrito- basically a guacamole omelette in a flour tortilla with beans. =D Machaca burrito =D and..the taquitos!! Some of the best taquitos ever with a huge glob of guacamole =D The only bad thing is that the prices have gone up. 2 taquitos for $7? Burritos for 8? 1 taco $3.50? They don't serve alcohol, but sometimes Manuel will be nice and give you a shot or two =D Don't forget your candy when you leave either!

I finally got to try the famous El Tepayac. My friend had raved about the burritos from this quaint restaurant that sits on one of the East L.A. Hills (yes - east l.a. has hills too!). So we're driving, driving, driving and I'm telling her, "tell me when ok?" Then she says, "Ok, it's here, where that huge line is." Quickly, I turned into the small parking lot and parked right next to the little worship garden. We went up to the "to-go ordering" spot and it took no more than 5 minutes before we took our babies home. Babies. The burritos were like the size of a 4-5 lb baby. good lord! I think I got the Hollenbeck Steak Picado burrito (came with beans, rice, onions, cilantro and big chunks of steak with sauce) without the sauce topping (ironically, i'm not much of a wet burrito gal). When I opened the box, the burrito was so huge and it went from corner to corner. It was really good! I only got to eat about a quarter of it and saved the rest for later. When later came, we managed to make dinner out of it for two people, one including a growing young man. We were stuffed! So you know how when you go to your momma's house and she's packing up food for you to take with you and she puts all these things in containers for you, salsa, cheese, lemon, ketchup packets, really anything she can find in the fridge. Aw, what? You're not your mom's favorite? Ok, well my mom does this for me all the time and I felt right at home at El Tepayac because when I got home and dug in to the bag, I found that the lady had put the wet burrito sauce in a container for me, along with tons of green salsas (I guess she overheard me tell my friend I loved green salsa), and lemon. Woman after my own heart, I swear. I plan to make chilaquiles with that salsa!! On to the salsa -wow! They must have the spiciest green salsa I've ever tasted! It's really good, but it did give me heartburn later and made my nose run. Sinuses CLEARED!   Overall, El Tepayac deserves all the accolades it receives. I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos! Imagine?

It's not authentic nor is it exceptional.... it's a hole in the wall place, like so many taco stands around L.A.   The people at the Travel Channel are smoking something, this place was a WASTE OF TIME! There was a line of people waiting outside because this so-called 'restaurant' is the size of my living room, with people packed in like sardines, loud and unpleasant.  And with their prices, you would think they were like an El Compadres Restaurant or something.  But I opted to give them a chance and ordered my food 'To-Go'. When I got home, I found that THEIR REFRIED BEANS WERE OUT OF THE CAN!!!  WTF?  (I can tell between home-made refried and canned beans - HUGE difference.) Portions might be decent but whats the point if the food is flavorless?!  AND THE MEALS DO NOT COME WITH SALSA!  When I ordered 'chips & salsa', they even forgot to include my salsa.  WTF?!   Save your $$, gas and time (by not waiting in line for 45 minutes).  Go to King Taco, Dos Burritos, or a real restaurant which is not over-hyped, over-priced and smaller than your apartment.  It's a taco stand that serves absolutely NOTHING SPECIAL AND THE FOOD IS ALMOST UN-EDIBLE. Thanks gringos at the Travel Channel for the recommendation - it sucked. AND SOME OF YOU YELPERS MUST BE GETTING PAID TO LEAVE ANYTHING ABOVE 2 STARS.  Your reviews have deceived me.

Tasty, dirt cheap, and ginormous quantities.  El Tepeyac is a shining example of why we all worship the hole in the wall.   I challenge every other Mexican restaurant I've been to in the greater Los Angeles area to serve taquitos like these: they're fat with tender, shredded beef and not skinny and dry like most others.  But the beauty of it all is the mound of chunky guacamole that tops them.  I'm not talkin' tablespoons here--y'know, the kind of tablespoon that gets lost in a bed of shredded lettuce (anyone else share my disdain for that?).  I'm talking about a heap of guac that's typically shared between 4 people at every other restaurant in town. No lie.  When was the last time your guac ran out of taquito? For that matter, when was the last time your burrito ran out of tortilla?  I ate a quarter of my Manny's special burrito and had to order tortillas to go.   The beef tacos are so loaded with shredded cheddar cheese that you'd swear you made them at home.   Not my favorite Mexican food, but the quality, quantity, price, and homey service (you can tell the same people have been working there for decades) is one in a million.

Prolific! Never before has there ever been such a great burrito as the `Hollenbeck` for a spicy beef burrito drenched in a red chile sauce. You will need a knife and fork and a designated driver. Not for every day eating, but certainly to be remembered as the day you ate at Manny's El Tepeyac Cafe . Make the trip and say hello to Manny who personally sits most of his guests. He will remind you of your grandfather.

Just three words to describe..... QUANTITY OVER QUALITY. No doubt a classic old place where people line up forever to eat.  However, much like Tito's Taco's in Culver City, I just don't get it. The other BIG negative is seeing all the Latino gang members and their families standing and or eating all around you...... Service was excellent.......  But I'll risk my life eating elsewhere....

I have a hard time handing over all five stars. I guess I think of five stars as "now that I know this place exists, I can't live without it" and want to reserve it for serious, serious food love. We were in the market for a cheap meal. We got there at five pm and there was a line of people on the sidewalk. You wait outside until a table opens, then an empolyee will come out and invite the next group in. I was starving, having saved myself all day, so the wait felt eternal but was probably 25 minutes. When seated, we realized there was no liquor or beer. Well, fine, even cheaper meal! We split a "1/2 guace with chips" as the appetizer and settled on sharing the Hollenback muchaca (shredded beef) burrito. The guac came first- good thing I resisted ordering the "full guac with chips", the 1/2 was huge! For $5.50, it was crazy good deal. It was also crazy good-tasting guacamole! The problem was the two of us could never finish it, even if we drowned our burrito in it. Not being able to finish an order of guac just felt wrong. I'm more accustomed to licking the little bowl than leaving any behind. We didn't really dent our huge guac mound before the burrito showed up. It was, as promised, enormous. Stewart divided into two very large burritos. We ordered sour cream to go on top and melted cheese, extra charges fyi. It wasn't as pretty as I expected it to be, and it tasted a litle different than I would have thought. The meat was very good- tender, juicy, flavorful. The red and green bell peppers on top were a very predominant flavor, along with a tangy tomatoey sauce with a zip. The Rice and Beans, which I had read were excellent, were sort of drowned out, couldn't really discern their taste. I sort of tried to order an extra side of each for this reason but the waitress looked at me like I was insane and warned me "Is very big! Burrito is very large!", but next time I would, even if I couldn't finish everything. The sour cream and guac did their thing on top and did it well. Over all, it tasted very good, in a comfort food kind of way, not in a "how did the genius chef achieve this?" kind of way. It was very tasty and a great price- our entire check with sodas, oversized guac, and tricked out burrito was 21 bucks. Even with the tip it was still slightly less than our Arclight movie tickets! And even splitting the massive burrito, I left STUFFED. They gave us a handful of double bubble and tootsie rolls (the long skinny kind, horay) which was perfect for the movie were going to. It was hike from Culver City, but I'll come back some day. I'd like to try some of the other dishes. Oh- when we left at 6 pm, the line was looooooooooooog, yikes.

At the take-out window, once I asked for the price of the large horchata ($2.99), I felt it was high.  A large horchata in this location should be $1.50 to $1.80 max.  But then I asked for the price of a small one ($2.55), I decide not to order ANYTHING.  Being a businessman and a good mathematician, I smelled a very greedy man behind the operation.  Here's the game theory for this.  You see $1.99 would have been greedy enough for the location but smart enough to hide under the 2 dollar mark.  But the guy  is not  only asking over $2 but actually over the 2.50 mark at 2.55 not 2.45.  I smelled the heavy stench of greed. I refused to have any food here because i know it cannot be better than all the good mexican food I have had in this town. I guess I am used to tacomiendo which despite being on the west side is both good and inexpensive.  I also don't believe in paying %30 more than what a meal is worth.  A $200 dinner at Valentino is well worth it and an $8 burrito in Boyle Heights is not. This place is a rip-off, especially for its location.  What is this Beverly Hills? Every item was 30% higher than Tacomiendo which is in Culver City and not the gang-ridden Boyle Heights.  This place is too popular...

First, I dare anyone to navigate the streets of ELA to get here. It's not easy and requires a lot of courage, unless you live here of course. I used to live off of Rowan and Cesar Chavez Bl. Basically, this was an illegal house to restaurant conversion that eventually received a permit to do business the legal way. Who's gonna deny this place a permit anyway? Fat ass Councilwoman Gloria Molina, The Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, countless cops, firemen, and other politicians frequent this joint I'm sure. I park around the corner on a public street because I don't want to deal with the hassle of the little lot. In most cases, I have to wait out front until the folks inside start slowly exiting. Upon entering this restaurant, you have a slim choice of a bar stool area, and some dining tables. Room in here is very limited. I wasn't joking when I said this was a home to restaurant conversion. Manny still works this place and you can identify Manny by his distinguished raspy voice and large prescription glasses. Nice guy all around. I usually order the Hollenbeck burrito. Feeds a family of twenty. Picture two of Oprah Winfrey's thighs wrapped in a large flour tortilla and you can visualize the size of a Hollenbeck burrito. Just a masterpiece that you can't possibly finish. They also have a walk up window that I was completely unaware of until my last visit here. I cannot wait to go back!

I saw this restaurant on Man vs. Food and I was so excited to try this place because I love grungy hole in the wall mexican places with amazing food. The show made my mouth water, so I was like alright, I HAVE to go. I called up my favorite foodie (also my best friend) who goes to USC and asked him if he had heard of it and he said no. We hung up, and 10 minutes later he called me back and told me he had yelped it and we were going this weekend. I believe we went on a Saturday at like 3:00 PM and there were 4 people ahead of us in line, outside. We wanted to eat there to get the whole experience, so we chose to wait in line - the line took about 20 minutes and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. You could also opt to order from the to-go menu which was outside on the side of the building. It was a little odd that they kept the door to the restaurant closed until they had a table ready. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. Hahaha, and when they finally opened the door, it was amaaazing. The restaurant itself was tiny, but not cramped. I was kinda hoping Manny would be there forcing tequila shots on people, like on the show, but he wasn't (I wasn't really expecting him to be, just on a whim). Our hostess seated us at a table, but there was also counter seating available. I ordered the vegetarian burrito. OMG, soooo good and HUGE. I ate about one quarter of it and was full. Someone at the table next to us had ordered Manuel's Special - which is a 6 lb, burrito loaded with all kinds of  good stuff on top. Aven referred to the experience of eating the burrito as "eating a baby" because it was the size of a new born. He ordered the nachos which were piled high with an insane amount of cheese, guacamole, etc. Definitely not for the health conscious. This tops the charts of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I will definitely be back many times. The drive from Irvine was well worth it and so was the wait in line. I'm hungry now!!

IMO - niki'd review was straight troll'n Anyways, Great place.  But be prepared to wait, because this place is the bee's knees.   Huge portions (side of guac is a meal!), great location (close to cal state LA/downtown/USC hosiptal) and nice people who work there.  I recommend the vege burrito - wet.  Huge slices of onions, cheese, and everything is fresh. The hostess (male, mind you) has been working there for years, and hes one of the nicest guys around.     They dont serve beer/liquor, but I think this place can get away  with it.

I've been here quite a few times now, but it has always been take out. The place is old and nostalgic, but I'm not the sentimental kind of guy (hence my poor review of Clifton's Cafeteria). However, unlike Clifton's, the food here are worth coming for. Since I live 5 minutes away, I just get it at the outside take out window and eat at home. I first discovered it last year when they put it on the market after being in business over 20 years. Before a new owner could ruin it, I thought I better try it. As far as I know, it still hasn't sold. If you like wet burritos and have a big appetite or family and friends who like to share, this is an excellent place. I've tried the Hollenbeck de Pollo (fed 3 of us) for $9.20 and Manuel Special de Pollo (fed 4 of us) for $19.50. We are a skinny Asian family so the prices come out well for us. Mileage may vary for you and your family. I am not Mexican, so I can't vouch for authenticity. Most of the clientele are Mexican, so that gives me some indication that it is authentic. But I don't really care who the other customers are because the food speaks for itself. One thing I generally think about this kind of Mexican food is that it lacks contrast - so that is another reason I like take out. Along with these incredible delicious sauce-heavy burritos, I make a nice spring mix salad with a vinaigrette dressing to balance it out. They lack a side salad on the menu, instead offering french fries, rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, tacos, taquitos, etc. See what I mean. Lack of contrast. They have tostadas, quesadillas, sandwiches, and various dinner plates, none of which I have tried. After all, they are known for their burritos and I go there when I'm in the mood for a burrito, so that is what I get. So what are you waiting for? Go there and try it!

You just need to remember 3 things when you come here. 1.) Hollenbeck Burrito 2.) Hide the wifey/GF if you do not want Manuel to kiss her hahah 3.) Beware if he gives you a shot of tequila in the morning. Joking aside, one of the best chile verde in LA.  You probably wont even get through a normal burrito but it's tasty goodness to go.  Check this place

Visited here a couple times for lunch, I was surprised by the effort my friend had in venturing from her office in downtown LA.  But with it being right next to the 10 fwy. the parking was the only hang up...  Well, the seating was a bit of a challenge too, it seemed like every detective from the LAPD was here, as well as Fire Chiefs! I'm glad I was hungry because the portions here are not for the shy!  I got the machaca burrito and at first I thought I wasn't going to finish this beauty but the favors made my eyes roll back into my head and I became an eating machine!!

I am about to commit high treason for what I am about to say.  But, i would like to know that I will at least be truthful and repent before I die.   Please tell my wife that I "usually" loved her! Get ready for this....This place is like montezuma's revenge.  Intended to target all non hispanics for all of the social injustices to mexicano's through time  and for stealing California from Mexico. If i said the food here was good, I would be slapping my abuelita in the face and spitting on her grave(she is not dead yet by the way).  The food is bland and expensive for being beans, rice, and what i think is beef, chicken, and pork.  Look at it....anything shredded like that can't be meat.  If your latino and think the food is good, then you were raised a mother or grandmother who couldn't cook for sh*t.  I haven't read the reviews but I can bet that most of the people who like this place are not from "around here" and just wanna see what's doing.  Authentic places have flavor..most likely from Lard and are heavily seasoned with chili, etc.   Back in the day, the food was cheaper and tasted better.  Now, its more of a novelty in my opinion.  I've had my share of "hollenbacks", Manny's Special, etc but Im not a youngster anymore.  In the world of Yelping...Imma Shot Caller.  Don't hate the player...its just part of the game(oh yeah...I changed it...because I can).   Keep on Yelping

I HATE LARD! And guess what? everything here is swimming in it! Especially the tortilla chips that felt like bombs to my stomach--as I write this now I suffer from the effects (aka explosions). The food is served in industrial portions. First adjective that came to mind: grotesque. It just looks like wacatelas!!!! I had the enchiladas rojas con pollo. Couldn't finish half of it... And no way on earth I could handle their burrito, which looked like the meal for an army. Best thing of the evening: will.i.am. He was there eating, that being a close place to eat in his childhood as he grew a few blocks away from there. Other than the random celebrity sight-seeing, El tepeyac offers cheap, vein-clogging food, that might make you happy, if you survive the heart attack...

OMG. My boss took me here when we were up in LA for a work meeting. He was so excited and raving about the place and grew up eating it. The inside is small with maybe 8 tables and counter seating. He said we were lucky because we got there early and the line wasn't out the door yet. There were 3 of us that night and we ordered 2 hollenbecks. A male co-worker and I shared one and my boss had the other. The portions were enormous! I ate about 1/4 and so did my co-worker. I took the rest home to the boyfriend who made it into two meals! My boss somehow managed to eat the entire thing. I was almost disgusted watching him though. The hollenbeck burrito had big pieces of carnitas inside and around the outside. It was covered in red sauce that  wasn't too spicy. Inside was refried beans, rice, guac, and cheese if I remember correctly...You could tell the pork had been cooked low and slow because it just fell apart. Yummy! Service was quick and very friendly. Prices are good here for the amount of food you get. Unfortunately, I probably will never eat here again since I live "behind the orange curtain". But if I were in the area by some odd chance I would definitely stop in.

I've dined at El Tepeyac numerous times and found it to be very good each time.....until recently. During my last visit I found the the meat in the Hollenbeck burrito was dry and overcooked, as if they took left over meat from two weeks before and added it to that day's batch. BUT that was not the deal breaker for me.  The reason I will never go back again was more of a sanitary reason.  Half way into my two week old burrito, I looked back into the kitchen to find the guy who had just made my food BLOWING HIS NOSE IN THE KITCHEN IN PLAIN SIGHT!!!!  I saw it and I HEARD it.....Granted he was using a napkin...BUT BLOWING YOUR NOSE IN THE KITCHEN!?!?!?!?! To top it off...HE WENT BACK TO MAKING BURRITOS WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS! I know there are many things that happens behind the scenes in many restaurant that perhaps we are not privi to, however, to see it (and hear it) actually happen in one of your favorite spots just KILLS IT for me. RIP El Tepeyac......I will never be coming back

I haven't been to Manuel's El Tepeyac in like 8 years, and I don't plan to especially if I can go down the street to Ciro's and have a tastier meal with complimentary guacamole, salsa and chips. Or better yet, just drive down like a mile Southeast to Los Cinco Puntos on Brooklyn, oops, I meant Cesar Chavez and take it to go! I had enough El Tepeyac over my life and realized every time I eat there, the food is way too salty and just overly spicy...and let's not forget that it's a religious experience for the loyalists, because it's tradition to eat at Manuel's. Don't get me wrong, I love spice! I believe El Tepeyac does too much of the aforementioned because they are masking their otherwise bland food. Everyone knows when you add tons of salt, the food 'seems to' taste better. Add in a ton of spice and your taste buds are thrown outta whack...therein lies the perfect concoction for a food masquerade. Oh how dare I review El Tepeyac in such fashion! Look, I used to eat here a lot. Even been able to pound a Manuel's Special all by myself. I just got tired of having to drink 5 gallons of water to offset the salt intake! Does Manuel's serve huge portions, heck yeah! Would I go there for an out-of-towner? Perhaps...but I can think of many other restaurants to dine at and relish in the substance of the meal than the folklore of a fabled East LA gem.

Have you heard of Burrito Dos Manos? Psssh... This is Burrito Ocho Manos y Dos Pies! Holy guacamole! Forget the U.N. World Food Programme -- a single El Tepeyac burrito can feed a small nation. It is seriously the biggest burrito I've ever laid eyes on. Ok, you get the picture. But while it's not the best I've had, it certainly leaves me content (and gasy... but mostly content).

Saw the giant and delicious looking burritos on Man Vs. Food so had to stop by when I was in town. I went in for dinner on a weekday and had to wait in line outside the building for about 30 minutes. I was by myself so I was able to get a seat up at the bar much quicker than most of the larger groups that were with me in line outside. I knew I was in for a treat was that I was the only white person in line outside and the only one inside of the restaurant the entire time that I was there. Very friendly people and my server suggested the Hollenbeck burrito. It was a tasty burrito that was filled with carne asada, beans, and rice. It was also topped with red sauce and shredded cheese. The burrito was massive and I was barely able to finish it. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other things that I saw on other peoples plates.

5 pound burritos. Had to come see for myself.  Okay so, the neighborhood isn't so great and the place looks small and old,  nonetheless, there was still a long line of people from different backgrounds waiting patiently to get in.  So, we waited with them.  They have a small outdoor seating area and a section where you can order food to go.   When we were finally seated, after waiting 45 minutes, someone came to bring us menus immediately and we were able to place our orders. Before we knew it,  dinner was served. My bro had the 5 lb burrito - he chose the pork in chile verde with the works.  It was enormous! Big enough to serve a family of     four. And then, not only that, it is also topped with generous amounts of the pork in chile verde! I had to take a bite, I tried a big chunk of the pork topping, and well, I became a fan. The meat was so tender and juicy and the chile verde was just delicious with a little bit of a kick to it.  We were there for one hour and my bro ate about 3/4 of it and just couln't eat any more of it after that. The rice, beans, cheese and veggies along with the meat was a great combo. I had the regular carne asada burrito, which I could not finish because the portion was just too big. It was really good- the beef was soft and tender and flavorful.  Our friends had the carnitas burrito, which they also enjoyed. The only part I didn't enjoy about the meal was the drink - we all had horchata and we all asked to send it back.  It was so gritty that the bottom of our glasses were filled with rice flour/sediment - about 1/4 of the glass.  We asked the waitress about it and she insisted that horchata is supposed to be like that - really?  I may not be Hispanic but I have had horchata before, not the kind sold at Raplhs but from mom and pop Mexican restaurants and from my trips to Mexico.  After arguing with her, she finally decided to take them back and brought us sodas. So, the experience would have been better had the waitress not done that.  I enjoyed the burritos and have definitely gone back. I've just stopped ordering horchata.

Loved it!! My friend took a shot of tequila with Manuel, and that old man is quite the riot. So full of life, and oozing with exuberance. God bless that mans soul, and let him live another 100 years. My friend and I split Manuel's Special burrito (chicken/pollo). So so so good! It was juicy and flavorful. The guacamole was so good, and the chicken was in strips. Oh man my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The service is also extremely amazing, but it helped that my friend knew Spanish. I just stared in amazement and confusion.

It's the original and it's the best. I defy anyone to find a better wet burrito anywhere else in LA. Recommendations: Hollenbeck, Manuel's special, Hollenbeck de Machaca. Basically any burrito. Careful when ordering  the Chicken burrito ( it is simply chicken meat wrapped in a tortilla) and not a good representation of the wonders that embody all their other burritos. Breakfast is also grub. Used to be cash only so make sure to stop at the bank. Prices are very reasonable. Massive portions so come hungry.

This place is soooo awesome that it hurts. theres always a line to get in but its soooo worth it. the Manuel special. My family has been ordering that for 20 years. the guys love my dad so much that they sneak him beers from their personal stash. the Manuel burrito consists of a burrito the size of a plate, filled with marinated pork and all the in-burro goodies. then its topped with more chunks of pork. then as a tease, they put a little bit of beans and rice on the side for looks. hahahahahhaha. no joke it took 4 of us to eat this, and we still had a 1/4 of it left over. this is the place to go if you want to see what the inside of an emergency room looks like 2 hours and 3 shocks after the meal. gotta  love that cardiac delight special....!!!!

I've been holding off on tackling my first Manny's Special for no good reason, so today I decided to get off my ass and drive to EasLos to meet the monster. After learning about my plans, my dad wanted to tag along for the sake of reminiscing. The last Manny's Special he attempted was decades ago when I was a mere pup, so we decided to make this a father/son challenge. Once we arrived, we waited for about 10-15 minutes outside, which wasn't bad at all considering it was around 1pm. Once we were seated, we placed our orders and the food arrived in no time flat, piping hot and bursting full of flavor. My dad, being the old man that he is now, couldn't handle the burrito, so he only had a small sliver of it. I, on the other hand, ate about 3/4 of the plate at the restaurant (the rest would be consumed at home later). I have to say that I was deeply satisfied with the dish. I'm sure there are other places out there that offer better food, but honestly I was happy with this spot. Coming to El Tepeyac is about the experience, not just the food. There are few spots where the owner will come outside to meet, greet and seat you. The service and atmosphere here was warm and friendly and of course the food was delicious. Would I come here again? Most definitely.. Now that I've tackled the Manny's Special, it's time to see what else is good on the menu. Plus my stomach and toilet can't handle another offering like that for a while. Recommendations: The Chile Verde Manny's Special was pretty good.. Most of the meat was juicy and tender, but there was the occasional dry/tough chunk which would ruin that individual bite. On a side note: the guacamole here is THE BUSINESS.. Seriously, I was fixing to order a whole side of it to supplement my burrito.. Perhaps next time? Warnings: I was lucky for my first experience here to find parking and wait only a little bit, but from the looks of it, this place can get packed and the wait and parking can potentially be enormous headaches.

The food is amazing .... We waited quite a while to be seated but it was so worth it. The guacamole is bomb and so was the steak picado burrito ... Cant wait to go back

The Hollenbeck is superior to the Okie burrito. Lettuce in a burrito is just wrong. I thought the guacamole would be enough for me not to notice , but no. Take home your leftovers and feed a family of four. Special thanks to Tracy who waited on us on the patio where my dog not only was welcomed but received a water dish, cuddles, attention and a little asada. Two paws up!!!

So I don't eat pork, sue me. We got to El Tepeyac a little after the lunch rush but there was still a line out the door.   So I ordered the Hollenbeck but with chicken and apparently it changes the whole chemical composition and deliciousness of the burrito.  There wasn't anything special about it except that it was the size of my thigh and could feed me for the next week. FYI the restaurant is tiny but you can order from the same menu from a window and take it to go or eat it outside.

When I used to work in Downtown LA, we'd used to make the trek over to East LA for great Mexican food at ET.   The Hollenbeck burrito was humongous.  ET has the best taquitos.   I haven't worked downtown in years, so I haven't been back to ET since.  I'll need to make the trek out there again since I crave the taquitos!

This is what a burrito is all about!: I'm not sure if El Tepayac is where the burrito was first sold, but it is where the burrito has achieved its pinnacle! There are many items on the menu, but I suggest you stick with one of the burritos. My personal favorite is the Hollenbeck. Large chunks of well-seasoned pork make this delicious! The Hollenbeck could easily feed three, though I put one away with ease. Many of my friends like the Okie burrito. Try all of them. Be prepared to stand in line, either to sit inside, outside or even to order to go! This little place is well known and always busy.

The best Mexican food in L.A!!!!! I grew up in East L.A, and have been coming to El Tepeyac my entire life. This place never changes, and that's a good thing. This place is totally unique compared to other Mex food joints in East L.A(or anywhere else). Definitely an original, and often imitated I don't make it back to East Los as often as I'd like, but when I am in the area, I always stop here to eat. Viva El Tepeyac!!!!!!

I grew up on El Tepeyac.  My dad used to pick up a Manuel's Special on his way home from work and we would eat it for dinner.  One Manuel's Special still feeds my whole family.  I once brought a Manuel's Special to work to treat my co-workers.  Manuel himself made the burrito and handed it to me at 6:45am.  He also invited me to take a shot of tequila.  I will always remember that. Besides the Manuel's Special, I've had a Hollenbeck burrito, a machaca burrito, the chile rellenos, and the taquitos.  Those are my usuals, and they never disappoint. I've sat inside, outside, and took out.  It's good anyway you want to take it.

So, being that I work in Downtown Los Angeles I find myself eating alot of different types of mexican foods, asian foods, and at various burger and sandwich joints. Manual's aka el Tepeyac is one of the few places that I actually enjoy returning to from time to time. It's a great blend of flavors. To address the issue of flavor, I agree that this stuff is not a packed punch when you take a bite...and frankly I think this is one of the reasons why I enjoy this. I think we sometimes confuse "too satly" with flavor. perhaps a bit of salsa would help, but the more you add to it..the more your gonna take away.....as some are stating...the food has a lack of flavor for them to begin with. but the flavor of the sauce, meat, beans, cheese, guac, and rice are more than enough for me to enjoy. my only problem with this place is the cost of things...very pricey place to dine. i still think it's worth it to grab a burrito.....in fact our favorite thing to do is buy those HUGE $20 Hollenbeck that feed seriously more than 4 people here... I say go in there not expecting much and you'll be more surprised...i find when i build myself up to something too much I tend to disappoint myself. but this place is for sure one of the many spots that i return to often... it is a legend of los angeles after all!

I confess I learned about this place from Man vs Food (a digusting yet alluring show) during the LA episode and you know what?  Those were no camera tricks when they videoed those burritos. They are damn HUGE!! Luckily for me this little E LA diner is a quick drive from my work, so a few local street turns and 10 mins, I was there.  I decided to go with the first thing I saw on the menu, the Hollenbeck burrito with the chili verde pork.  OMG for something costing less than $8, I was in heaven and as I stared at this massive tortilla wrapped thing larger than my two fists put together, I took a deep breath, picked up my fork and knife and got to work... The lady sitting next to me at the counter was staring at my food and asked if I was going to finish it right then and there, but I told her 'are you kidding?  i'm taking the rest home'.  but before I knew it I finished almost 3/4 before I safely threw in the towel and decided to finish the rest later that night. Service is really friendly altho I didnt see that crazy owner, although maybe I needed to be a female to draw his attn.  With prices that cheap and food that good i'll definitely be back.  Definitely come prepared with as empty a stomach as possible.

My friend had just come back form a trip to Thailand and was leaving again to got to Mali and Boston for several months. We were desperate to see her so she invited us to join her for dinner here. I read the reviews about this baby sized burritos and didn't think it was possible. Well that was sunday, today is tuesday, and I am still eating the burrito. Be ready to wait, and wait outside, but it is totally worth it. We had 10 people in our party and they did their best to accommodate us. The table was a bit small for all of us and our food, but it was cozy and that is ok. The food itself was amazing. I got the Hollenback De Chile Verde. YUMMY! There was the right mix of guac, rice, beans, and chile verde. The chile verde itself was delicious. The pork was well seasoned and just fell apart in my mouth. What also makes this place great is the price. It is like 8.95 for a burrito and I have made it last three days. You could easily split a burrito between two people and probably have left overs. I will totally come back here as it is well worth the drive and the wait.

I am still feeling the after effects of eating a Manuel's special and drinking a crap load of beer. But it's a good thing. I have been going to El Tepeyac for years and I just found out that you can special order a Manuel burrito. They call it a foot long. So me and my pure genius thinking their foot long burrito is pretty much the same size as their Manuel's special, order 2 footlong's. Christ, the burrito was the size of Shaqs foot. Who knew they make tortillas that big, it was the size of granny panties, yeah I know not a very good visual. The cool thing about ordering a foot long burrito is that it comes in it's own little special aluminum container. And if any one has ordered a Manuel's special then you know that it usually comes on a cardboard plate wrapped in foil. Not the best way to take one home. The worst part of the night, was that I was at home watching the Lakers blow a 20 point 3rd quarter lead. I don't know if I will be able to look at a Manuel's special the same way. Ah well at least the food was good!

I have been going to El Tepeyac for * years *... since around 1980. Some of the employees who worked there then are still working there. My favorites have always been: The taquitos with guacamole. Some of my mexican friends call these "tacos enrollados". I have tasted taquitos in many places over the years. I have never had any better than at El Tepeyac. Burrito de Machaca - this is shredded beef, mixed with onions, green peppers and eggs. Burrito de Chorizo - chorizo is a delicious mexican sausage. They mix it with scrambled eggs. I always tell them to hold the beans. I don't like burritos with beans. Torta de guacamole - this is a burrito with an omelette inside. The omelette is stuffed with guacamole. I think I have never seen this on any menu. Has to be an El Tepeyac original. I didn't read all the other reviews, but I am sure somebody mentioned MANUAL'S SPECIAL.  This is probably the most legendary burrito in the united states. If there is a more famous burrito, I'd like to know. I don't even think I have ever even SEEN this thing ordered by anyone, that's how rare it is. They take two flour tortillas, the size of elephant ears. They make a burrito out of those flour tortillas. The thing is so big, that it hangs over the side of the plate. The legend is - if you can eat one of these things, they meal is on the house. Something like that!  They should keep a tally of how many people have actually been able to finish one of those things! Again - this is a truly legendary place in Los Angeles food lore. When you go there, you see people from all walks of life. You'll see nurses and doctors from Los Angeles County hospital which is nearby. You'll see police officers and firemen on their lunch breaks. You'll see local folks enjoying the food. You'll see people from all over southern california. And the mark of a truly hot spot - you will usually see a long long line snaking along the side of the building. HOWEVER - definately think before you look in the kitchen. If you look in the kitchen you might not want to eat there. I have taken friends there, and when they saw the kitchen they told me "NEVER AGAIN"... Never phased me! they're busy! They'll get around to cleaning it up when they have time! they're working fast in there! I highly reccomend this place. If this place ever shuts down, it's going to be a black day in Los Angeles history. Long live El Tepeyac Cafe

This restaurant is the reason I made a Yelp account. El tepeyac has a lot of hype and I treated my parents, girlfriend and I for a new years dinner here.  The wait was worth it as once you're in we were greeted by our lovely waitress. The place has tons of regulars as well as new customers. I had the Okie De Pollo which was A+ with a cup of Horchata that anyone else would charge 4 bucks for was $1.50. A kid at the table next to us finished the Manuel special and was given a free (And very fashionable El Tepeyac t-shirt) The food had great fresh and tasty ingredients and was served so politely, I must say this was the nicest waitress I've ever had. Anyone who says the food here is novelty and "quantity over quality" is insane, its delicious. Definite return! Definitely recommended! Come hungry!

Split the Manuel's Special with two others and destroyed it. We had to get the guac on the side because it will kill me. I wasn't really paying attention to the taste. It was good enough. I was just trying to see if I could do the challenge, so I was concentrating on pace and being a fat ass. I had about half of it and I felt good. I think next time, I'm going to try the challenge if they'll let me sub something for gauc, on account of it killing me and all. The place is tiny so be prepared to wait.

I first heard about this place on man vs food. Thus, i decide to make it my mission to try it. Intially i wasn't expecting much since their specialty is an oversized burrito i though they were going to focus on quantity instead of quality. Luckily i was wrong. I got there and the place seemed really simple and  small,  it kind of reminde me of the dinners that come out on movies.  I was seated right away. When the moment came i decided to order the manuel special (that oversized burrito i was talking about) with steak instead of pork. The burrito was pretty big i think it can feed about 3 people. The service was nice and friendly and although the burrito wasn't the best it was pretty darn good. I would highly recomend to at least try it once.

After wanting to eat here ever since the LA MvsF episode I finally did.  I gotta say the area we were driving in to get there was a little unmotivating to travel through but glad we did.  The restaraunt kinda pops out of nowhere and bam your there.  After we entered I was shocked to see how small the inside was I mean its really really small...smaller than a Waffle House.  The lights and cameras really added size and illusion but anways enough of all that. I tackled the 9.95 Pork Burrito known as the Hollenback.  F***ER was HUGE...awesome!  Was very delicious pork was not just soggy gristly fat like you would get most places but instead was flavorful, soft, and even the fat was so cooked it melted in the mouth.  The sauce was delicious, with a tomato base with amazingly soft onions just delicious.  Rice, Beans, and Guacomole loaded this gigantic burrito and it was all very tasty...the Burrito alone was 5 out of 5. My only fault is that I was hoping for chips and salsa instead you have to request chips and the salsa they has was very dissapointing...IMO chips and salsa is a staple of mexican food thankfully the food was delicious cause if it came down to fixing food with this salsa I would have been unhappy. Also there was no shot of tequila at the door as mentioned on Man vs Food...Ok this one is petty and I didn't believe it to begin with but still dissapointing none the less. Overall worth the trip to the depressing area of LA, for a delicious Mexican Burrito...I would go again it was very good.

It's HUGE. I ordered the special machaca burrito, and shared it with 3 other people. It was enough to stuff me (full) and satiate the boys, okay. The value is pretty nice.  When we cut it into forths, each piece was about the size of a large burrito, only less tortilla and more stuffing. There is a lot of meat, which I like, but some parts of the meat was the cheap tough/ fatty bits.  It also came with an okay amount of bell peppers, beans, rice, and guacamole, and came topped with tons of cheese. Overall the flavor was pretty good.  I personally like more spice in my burritos.  I would have liked some hot sauce, salsa, and lime, personally. There was no line when I went (6:30 pm) and lots of street parking.  The seating area is a bit narrow and claustrophobic.  I wouldn't recommend large parties hang out here.   Overall, it's a must try experience.  If anyone can finish this on their own, kudos to you!

Manuel's Special - Asada for $23 the taste of the burrito was okay-good... maybe we should have ordered a different manual's special. we saw another table ordering a different special and it looked pretty good. the fun part was just seeing the plate of 5 lb. burrito being served. we split it four ways..it was filling. I wish they have more cheese. The meat itself was kinda bland. But eating it w/ the sauce and other ingredients was good. It was quite heavy.. w/ all the beans and guac in the burrito...it was a bit too much .. like i'd be eating and enjoying in the beginning..but towards the last few bites..i was ughhhh.... i saw other tables in which they ordered just a reg. burrito.. omg..it was HUGE! yes, i'll come back here again.. but definitely not anytime soon... i'm burrito-out.

In Scottsdale the other day I was talking to this white guy who was from East L.A. (bizarre, I know).  So we started talking about what else -- El Tepeyac.  We talked about how we were raised on this shit.  We debated the merits of the Hollenbeck vs. Manuel's burrito.  But ones thing is certain - El Tepeyac IS THE SHIZ!   The food is the BIZ-OMB and is almost TOO MUCH. I'm surprised that there's even a sprinkling of negative reviews.  Clearly you can't please everybody,  so don't be surprised by its distinctiveness or by long weekend waits, and plan accordingly. These burritos put San Francisco burritos to shame.  I love the machaca burrito in particular.  But even more I love that's it's far away from the Westside and Hollywood so it's not overrun by slummin-it hipsters.  Only the TRILL MOFOS make the pilgrimage for the Tepeyac.

If you like your Mexican food authentic and your Mexican-restaurant decor tacky, then El Tepeyac is the place for you. The portions are massive, and the service is usually pretty quick.  There can be a wait to get in at times, but it's well worth it.  Make sure you're hungry, though. If you're afraid of the neighborhood, you aren't very familiar with East L.A.

Definitely the place to be for if you are craving Mexican food. I came here with some friends on a Saturday night and boy was this place packed. Be prepared to search a little bit for parking. I ended up parking on one of the side streets after circling for several mins. We stood in line for another 5 mins before realizing they had a take out / patio area on the side. I guess its convenient if you plan on just picking up or sitting outside. We ordered the Manuel's special pork chile verde burrito. Being my first time here I had to see what the fuss was about. The burrito came out in a massive party tray. For the $21 we paid it was well worth it. The ingredients were good and plentiful, the pork was well cooked and the whole thing had the right amount of spiciness to it. You might be initial put off by the cost, but you do get what you pay for, massive amounts of great tasting mexican food. Next time I plan on trying the carne asada version.

This was one of LA's hidden gems until Travel Channel ruined it by exposing it to the rest of the world! This little café is situated across from a Catholic church in an unassuming Boyle Heights neighborhood. Even at 7am it's crowded, lively, and the staff is ridiculously friendly. I've actually never attempted a lunch visit, as I hear it's impossible to find a seat. Now for the food - you can't go wrong with the Manuel's Special Burrito (Pollo, for me). It's gigantic and filled with tons of meat, rice, lettuce, beans, and guacamole - and is enough for 2 or 3 people.  The extra large 1 footer is great for a potluck or party and easily feeds 10-15 people. I just picked one up for a work party and the smells of meat and sauce are making my stomach growl! Ok, so it's not the best Mexican food I've had in LA, but people are definitely the nicest. It's family owned, full of regulars, and worth a stop if you're in the area.

Called in for a pick up order of the Manuel's Special and Nachos. We got there 20 minutes later and the order was ready. My boyfriend's family and I were all excited to try the famous Manuel's Special since we've seen it on Man vs. Food. The burrito was huge and smothered with cheese and salsa, which was good. I excitedly took a bite only to taste the blandest burrito I've had!! It lacked taste and was too greasy! It was just like a huge pile of meat, rice beans and salsa, nothing more. The nachos were as greasy and not even crunchy!!! I don't know what's the hype but what I know is I got the worst heartburn ever after eating that I had to force the burrito out of me to feel better. Did we order the wrong things in the menu as I see a lot of 4 stars here?

If you ever hear people talking about "Manuel's" in East LA, that's this place.  The locals call it by the name of the legendary owner. Sinfully delicious Mexican fare that has NOT made any concessions to veganism or to the American Heart Association ... they still drench everything in lard, just like any traditional Mexican grandmother does.  But that's why it tastes so good. Burritos are HUGE ... you can easily feed a family of four with some of those monstrosities.  You can never go wrong with the taquitos and guacamole with refried beans either.  Diet be damned.  And if the owner is around, and he takes a liking to you, you might get slipped a free shot of tequila as well.  It happens every time my Mom (a long-time customer) is there with us. Lines can be long, as the place isn't very big at all, but if you don't insist on a waitress and real dishes, just go around the side of the building and order from the to-go window.  There are picnic tables out there for you to use, so it's not like you'd have to eat in your car. CLOSED ON TUESDAYS! But no matter how many times you're told that, you'll still probably show up on a Tuesday anyway.  So if you didn't listen to your fellow Yelpers, and you drove a long distance to get out there, just head to Ciro's across the street.  It's not quite the same, but decent enough.

The staff is very friendly and nice. The portions are huge. But that would be a deal if the food was good. This is your classic overly hyped place that is assessed on nostalgia and fond memories rather than the quality of its food. The food quality is not good, so the huge portions is a moot issue. Just because there are gunks of cheese on food you order does not make it a tasty and good Mexican dish; quite the opposite actually. If you go here, go for the legendary iconic status it holds. If you are going here looking for great tasting quality Mexican faire, it's not the place.

I am so glad that El Tepeyac (or Manuel's, for those on the "inside") is on Yelp. I've been going there with my family my entire life...literally, my parents started going there since college & it became a family staple ever since. My parents will drive 2 hours round trip on a weekend just to stock up on burritos that will feed them for a week. Top Choices: Hollenbech Burrito - can definitely feed two, so decide beforehand if you want enough leftovers for a meal and a half or if you want to share  & just take one (or two...) home with you. No point in splitting it to save money, however...the entire menu is extremely low priced. (burritos average $6-$8) Machaca Burrito - what can I say, it's like a bit of burrito heaven(there's also an equally delish Machaca tostada). Densely packed with meat and flavor, it's even more amazing with extra extra sauce upon request, and that goes for the Hollenbech burrito too Taquitos - Not only are the taquitos themselves uber fresh and delicious, it's enough to order them just to get the absolutely delish guacamole that comes with the plate. OHGOODNESS, so good! Enchiladas - my fave growing up until my stomach grew enough to accomodate even half of one of the burritos. The cheese stays melty and Ranchero sauce is perfection. Cheese, beef or chicken, never dissapointing. Things to know: *It gets super crazy and super busy, especially on Sundays, since it's across from a church, so be prepared to wait outside in line, first come first serve(service is super fast though). *They don't take reservations, but they do take to-go orders *Not in the best or most well-lit area, so be aware and mindful when going, especially later at night. *Wheelchair accessible outside (inside is densely packed but sometimes has room to accomodate & they are definitely willing)

Rarely does a place meet the hype, this place does. It's not fancy, it's not gourmet, it's just good food, lots of it, and great service. We went here at 9 Pm (they close by the way at 9:45 during the week), we had seen it on the Travel Channel and thought it looked interesting, there is plenty of parking right next to the building but the inside is tiny, so if you go during the day, plan plenty of time, since I get the feeling that a lengthy wait will greet you. The service was fast, extremely courteous, and very attentivve. I had the 2 enchiladas (cheese and beef) with rice and beans and it was a massive amount of food, sour cream was on the side and they doled it out with an ice cream scoop. My friend had the Hollenback, and although it is not the 6 lb Manuel special it still weighed about 3+ lbs and was filled wiht pork and covered in chili verde sauce, the burrito took up an entire oval plate...and my friend had to finally push it away as he was stuffed to the point of near explosion but could not stop eating it.  We also had the chips and Guacomole and it was very good, with again bening a very healthy portion. As I said before the service was great, we were clearly not regulars but you would not have known that by the way that both waitresses treated us and made sure that we had everything we needed. So to sum up, these are the types of places that we should all go, it' not about name dropping, the latest crazy food fad from somewhere else or weird service. This is neighborhood place that welcomes anyone, anytime they are open and fills thier tummies with yummies and does not empty their wallet while doing it. Go get a big burrito it will cure what ails you.

Probably the only place where I haven't been able to finish a burrito when I wanted to.  I was at a loss for words the first time I tried a burrito but could not for the life of me eat it all in one sitting. Lately (by lately I mean the last three years) I've been particularly enjoying Machaca con huevo, a delightful dish of shredded beef.   Be sure to avoid going there on Tuesdays.  I've made the mistake of forgetting which day of the week they were closed to pull into an empty parking lot and feeling an dreadful pit of despair in my stomach for being such a knucklehead. Also, try to say hello to Manuel the owner.  He mentioned to me last year that he was passing on the business to his daughter sometime soon.  Wonder if that happened already?  Anyhow, Manuel is great.  Always makes me feel right at home.

I have this thing, where I prefer the Mom and Pop shops, to larger Corporations, so I am constantly looking for new eateries (-shot out to http://Yelp.com). However, after going to El Tepeyac Cafe, for the second time, I have concluded, that I no longer need to utilize yelp for Mexican food in LA, EVER again. I took a friend with me last night, who is a self-proclaimed Mexican Food Connoisseur, and he NEVER stopped praising the amazing-ness of his Okie de Pollo burrito. I don't know if I was more amazed with his ability to pretty much devour his burrito in less than 15 minutes without chewing, and never shutting up about how good it was; or if I was just amazed with the size of the thing. So imagine measuring the length of your forearm, and doubling the width- that should give you a pretty good visual of how large their burritos are. They're flavorful, they're stuffed with the best of rice, beans, your choice of meat, cilantro, onions, and guacamole. Either way you go, Hollenbeck de Asada, which is like a salsa and cheese combination on top of your burrito, or Okie de Pollo, which is a red enchilada sauce with cheese on top of your burrito, you are never going to want to go anywhere else for a burrito. And the service is awesome!! ;-)

GOOD LORD. I heard about this Manuel burrito about five years ago and it turns out I needed all five years to get my stomach ready for this bad boy.  No, wait... I take that back.  I needed those five years to get my stomach ready for HALF of this bad boy. My cousin and I split this and I barely... managed... to finish my half.  That last bite sat there for a good 15 minutes before I forced it in my mouth.  Now I know what Adam Richman feels like when he's down to the last bite in his challenges (apparently he shot an episode here as well).  My cousin, unfortunately, came up about 4 bites short. After a 20 minute wait Friday night, we ordered the Manuel and got everyone's attention when it came out.  The funny thing was, while we were waiting for it to come out, we saw other people's burritos and thought, "I wonder if that's the Manuel.  If it is, it's not as big as I thought it would be.  On the other hand, if that's a regular burrito, it's freakin' huge!" We found out soon enough.  You'll know the Manuel when you see it.  It's over a foot long and its girth is no joke.  I cut it in half and put it on my cousin's plate and it honestly felt like it weighed about 3 pounds (reminder, this was HALF the burrito). Covered in cheese and salsa with huge chunks of pork on the outside, and filled with more pork, cheese, rice, beans and guacamole inside, we're not just talking quantity... it actually tastes really good!  The pork was tender and everything else was very flavorful and made it enjoyable... at least until the last few bites. In my prime, I probably wouldn't have finished more than 80% of this. But then again, you never know.

Not as amazing as I hoped, but not bad!! THE ORDER: 1/4 guacamole with chips: 3 stars.....nothing to write home about, but good and chunky, like I like it. The greasy, crispy chips could have used some salt. Chile Verde: 3 stars.....Brite Spot in Long Beach has the best I'vge ever had. Pretty hard to beat. Carne Asada Burrito: 3 stars.....we ordered it with cilantro and onions, but it had neither....bummer :( THE SERVICE: Ummmm, well. It was attentive, in it's own special way. They came by, but really didn't check in unless they were dropping something off. Also, Our main waitress was like Xanax'ed out or something like that..... OVERALL: There was a slight wait, but no biggie. I really just thought it'd be TASTIER. Maybe I'm spoiled having been raised in Long Beach, which is loaded with many great Mexican spots (specifically Super Mex!). Prob will not be back...too many other great options!! Enjoy! xo- andrea

After seeing El Tepeyac on Man vs. Food, I knew it was too close to me not to go. Can I just say I live for the Machaca.  It is my ideal Mexican meal: slow-roasted beef chunks with onions and peppers, served with melted cheese on top, some guacamole and pico de gallo.  I got it a la carte, but I'm sure it's also available with rice, beans and tortillas. My fiance got the Hollenbeck burrito, which is HUGE!  He loved it though.  I think it's safe to say we want to go back, next time with elastic waistband pants.

Holy Huge Burritos, holy crowded. This place is known in LA as a good place to go for honest Mexican food. They specialize in Burritos, so get one.

If you are a first-timer, order the Manuel Special.  I have been told it was named for the owner of the restaurant.  It is so HUGE!!!  Just like the other reviewers have described.  Let me describe how it will be presented to you at the take out window.  They will call your order number, you will proceed to the window, they'll ask you what kind of salsa/hot sauce you want.  They'll throw the sauce into a cardboard soda tray, the ones that hold 24 cans of soda...the Manuel special is the heavy goodness that is sitting on the tray. For 3 hungry men/women.  Great for office potlucks.  Bring one to your next party and people will be talking about you for days!

To know El Tepeyac is to know burrito perfection. This little cafe hidden in the outskirts of E.LA has established itself as Burrito mecca. People from all over the county come to this place for one thing only. To enjoy the best burrito's in L.A. I have never actually conquered a full burrito. The massive size of these tank like beef wraps are just to much for me.  Damn this feeble stomach of mine! This is no regular burrito my friends, this is infact the mother of all burritos. Theres usually a long line on the weekends, but if you call your order in you'll save yourself some trouble. SOme people are a tad hesitant to visit the area, but rest assured you'll be safe. This place is frequented by a steady and loyal folowing of L.A.P.D officers.

I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, period. But seriously... I have to say .. this place kind of blew my mind!! My bf was not kidding or over exaggerating when he described the Manuel's Special. I've never held a burrito on my lap like it was a freakin' large pizza... The thing was huge, delicious, cheesy, meaty, I could go on and on... But then I remembered I didn't like Mexican food (mainly because of the wierd mushy texture and smell of beans and taste of certain flour & corn tortillas...) all of that thought went out the window the minute I laid eyes on what my bf aka "The Burrito King.." calls "Burrito Heaven!"... He claims if he had to pick a death row meal.. this would be it. And that he could finish it all by himself in just one sitting. Although, I may disagree (just because I'm a true-to-my-roots-noodle-rice-spicy-loving-Asian-­girl), I can defintely understand why! ;) Needless to say this was a pretty awesome experience and I was very impressed! I would defintely go back there again.. and recommend it for others to try! There is a reason why places like this have been in business for so long and their parking lot is always packed with people lined up around the corner. Good job, Manuel! You have won me over! O! And we also had the carne asada quesadilla! To die for!!! =)

We love Tepeyac! The food is pretty good but most people come here for the portion sizes. The burritos are bigger than your head! I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito with pork. The pork chunks were just too big to be enjoyed. My mom ordered the Hollenbeck de asada and the steak was chopped to tiny pieces. We ended up sharing hers and took mines to go (my dad ate it later). So hands down the hollenbeck de asada is my favorite. Word to the wise. Prepare to wait for at least an hour! Unless you sit at the counter. There's always room there. There's this cool guy who gives you free beer. I forgot his name. But he's nice. Ask for a "cervesita or tequilita" and they'll hook you up. Gracias tepeyac for yummy in the tummy food!

Good lord they make an enormous burrito. The pictures here really don't do it justice, and that's not a knock on the photographers it's really just that big. Me and two of my friends, one who eats a lot and one who doesn't, tried to conquer Manuel's Special, Machaca edition and were punished for thinking that we, mere mortals could challenge a god in burrito form. The damn thing was like 14 inches long and 6 inches wide stuffed with beef, eggs, rice, and beans topped with hella cheese and sauce. We probably got through 2/3 of it before he had to tap out. What's crazy is despite how ludicrously big it was, it really tasted pretty good. We also got the half order of guac which is alot of guac and some horchata, both foolish ideas considering how indomitable manuel's special was. The guac and horchata were both quite good though! check it out, get the giant burrito but make sure you have atleast 4 people with you and know that even then it will still be a bit of a challange what's crazy is the menu says serves 2-4. WHAT TWO PEOPLE COULD EAT THAT?!

My friend heard about this place through the Travel Channel and I'm so glad I got to experience it.   The place is TINY!! And the best hole in the wall place I have ever been to.  The ambiance is so welcoming and the service was amazing.  The waiters are so sweet but nothing compares to Manuel the owner.  HOLY CRAP! I love that man.  He is the funniest little thing!!!  I went there at 11am and he offered me a shot of Tequila.  How can I resist??? I felt right at home. We had the 5lb burrito between the 4 of us and we were DYING!! It was SOOOOOOOOO GOOD though.  Considering the size, the quality of all the ingredients was the best! I would definitely come back! I'm from San Diego and trust me I know Mexican food.  This place is definitely a must try!

So my lil lady buddy was complaining about how hungry she was, and I looked on Yelp! for the closest thing to CSULA. The place had interesting name and that alone is enough to attract me to a location, so I didnt even bother reading the reviews. Had I though, I would have known beforehand what amazing little and popular place this is. We order tacos, enchilladas, quesadillas, and taquitos, and while we waiting we saw people ordering some monstrous burritos. The menu says it feeds a group of 8 people, some people were going at it in groups of two. The food tastes straight out of a home kitchen. Good quality, fresh, comes to you right from the grill all hot and full of flavor. If you see a big line of people outside, thats because theyre waiting to sit down. You can order food for pick right around the corner no problem! They have their own parking, but theres always a bunch of street parking. Some old guy sat down next to us and started going off and off about something...and then my friend turned around and she said, "so, they say the 3 candies they give you have an innuendo to them...one you suck, one you chew, and one you blow." Naturally... food and sex go together... Ill be back for that 8 person burrito!

A burrito the size of your face... and larger. I've only been coming here for about a year and I honestly haven't had a bad meal. The first couple times I tried to finish the entire NORMAL-sized burrito (successfully) and was punished later for it. My favorite burrito is the Machaca, minus the avocado. I can't eat more than this. It just isn't possible for me. My friends have tried to complete Manuel's especial to no avail... I feel like less than 0.1% of the population can finish that one. Be aware that you will probably be waiting a long time to sit down and eat especially if it is peak hours (lunch time) and don't expect completely attentive service. Enjoy your giant burritos, and pay respects to the memorial in the parking lot afterwards... you're going to feel like you have to after attempting to eat even the most meager burrito that they offer.

I have to agree with most of the reviews about this place. Sure the portions are huge but the food is bleh. It could be that I'm extremely picky about my mexican food but when food is covered i a mountain of cheddar cheese and shredded iceberg lettuce it makes me question the flavor. Three of my friends and I ordered the Manuel's special and yeah it was huge... but I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites because it had little to no enticing flavor.  This place is way to hyped up for what it is, it's not worth the drive to East Los. I'd rather hit up the taco stand on 1st street, seriously.

If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would give them 10. I had to wait in line to be seated (they do have take out, though) but it wasn't for long. I had the most delicious plate of enchiladas. My boyfriend said that you can always judge a Mexican restaurant by its rice and beans (just as you can judge an American or Italian restaurant by its bread). Everything was exceptional. Veeerrrrry filling-- we both had to get "to go" boxes (a first for my boyfriend) and even better the next day. Some people are uneasy about being in EastLos, but every one is different. Personally, I felt at ease with the area. And the drive is totally worth it!

Went here one rainy Saturday morning searching for a good breakfast burrito and I wasn't disappointed.  We showed up around 10am and the place was packed and we ended up at the bar next to a cool older man who kept trying to get me to take shots with him (he offered to pay), turns out he's the owner.   The burritos were good, the atmosphere was a little dark and dingy, but that seems like a must if a burrito place is going to be memorable.  The people that worked here were really nice and very accommodating with our order. Two things worth noting is the crowd of people so expect a wait and it's in the ghetto.

I am obsessed with Man v. Food so when Adam came here, I cleared out the next day in my calendar (no joke). The bf and I drove all the way here from Orange County and starved ourselves knowing already what we were going to order- The Manuel Special. 5 friggen pounds of pure burrito... But NO. This burrito was not pure. It was soggy and stuffed with iceberg lettuce and sourcream in the middle. Where the hell was my carne? Waited 20 minutes, ate 3 bites, left with 4.5 pounds of not so good burrito. Lo siento Manny, pero no me gusto.

All I have to say is this place is AWESOME! I had the Hollenbeck burrito with chucks of Pork covered over the top with a green sauce. My girlfriend had the Hollenbeck De Asada burrito. Both burritos were huge and delicious. Price was correct for the portion of food you get, not to mention home cooked goodness. Parking lot and establishment are on the small side, and could very well have to wait outside to be seated, but all worth the wait. Service was prompt and Manuel himself tends to help out a lot. One other good thing about this place is sometimes you get a shot of tequila from Manuel who I think is the owner. ROCKIN! The location might detour some folks, but they don't know what their missing. If you like Mexican food with home style mom and pop cooking with a spontaneous atmosphere....this is the place!!

Others may rave about the Okie, or the Hollenbeck, or crispy tacos, but for me, El Tepeyac is all about one thing: the Machaca Burrito. This is the tastiest burrito anywhere. Shredded beef, tomatoes, onions, a little egg, beans, and I'm afraid, a good amount of lard. No healthy Mex here, just delicious authentic old school burrito served up with no pretentions and some good guacamole. Now I can't recommend this place without warning you about a couple of things: 1. Do not eat the whole thing. You will explode like the guy in the Monty Python movie. 2. Do not plan on staying awake, as you will need to sleep this burrito off. Could it be the lard? I live in Berkeley now. We have some good eats up here, but what wouldn't I give for a El Tepeyac machaca burrito!

Named recently by ABC 7 as one of the seven best big portion places to hit up.. I checked it out last night. Man, I thought "Ten bucks for a two taco dinner plate? That's SO EXPENSIVE!" ...and then came out the actual plate. My jaw dropped. My boy J ordered the Hollenback which of course, even a triathlete couldn't even finish off. Poor guy had to take home a doggy bag. I say even if the place is as crammed as a sardine can (it's not that big), check it out Saturday night. It wasn't even that busy. We had to wait about 5-7 minutes, but no big. Portions definitely a PLUS! If I'd go back just for the food..ehhh.. maybe if the situation had arisen...and if I was in the area..and if I was with another person.. and if I had a craving for Mexican food. Lotttaaa 'ifs'. ---Update: 01/31/08--- Went here again last night on my boyfriend's whim. I stuffed up on some instant ramen before but sure, hey, why not get some big portions? The service here was SO much better than last night. Our waitress was extremely attentive to our needs. Instead of a small glass of water, we got the big coke glass worth. Because I was not so impressed with the tacos last night, I decided to try the "Hollenback de Pollo". Not liking guacamole, onions, or even excess beans, I expressed my wishes to the waitress. She went above and beyond and even suggested a few tips; like, instead of ordering extra guacamole, I should just have my guacamole on the side so J and I could share it with the chips. Smart. Why didn't we think of it? When she came out (much faster than I thought it'd take) with our food, she also supplied the salsa on the side because she remembered I didn't like onions - so if I wanted to, I could leisurely and at my own discretion pour the salsa on the Hollenbeck. She really impressed me. So half a Hollenbeck later, my full belly was about to burst. J was no better - only 2/3s finished with his. So this incident made me change my mind about the if's. Still it's preferable to have a companion since it is in East LA AND also depressing to eat that much alone. Probably another visit will cement my goodwill to the place. And while the Hollenbeck isn't the PERFECT burrito, it should be the epitome of Burrito With Huge Portions. P.S. Our bill came out to $20.02. I didn't have any change on me and neither did Jeremy so the cook simply waved it off. After all it was only two pennies. I know of places that would crucify you before coming to that conclusion. So for that this place rocks even more!

I grew up feasting on the Hollenbeck.  It's this massive burrito filled with chunks of red beef, beans, rice, and guacamole.   The thing has got to weigh 2 lbs.   Obviously, this is a landmark restaurant.  I've been there on weekends and seen minivans pull up loaded w/ families from the burbs making the journey to Manuels.   While I rarely get the chance to come here anymore, I did stop by recently to pick up my favorite burrito to go.  Nothing has changed.  The food was just how remembered it.   Oh there is one difference, I'm no longer able to polish off the burrito by myself.   If you're visiting the area and looking for a local institution, forget Philippes or Tommy's.  Come to Manuels/El Tepeyac.

I guess the first thing I want to say is that the neighborhood didn't look the safest. I felt kinda uncomfortable only because there was lots of sketchy people hanging around the restaurant entrance. There was some creepy looking kid who kept looking into the main door (transparent glass) and obstructing it. That was sort of annoying. Although, when we entered the restaurant, the staff was friendly and the customers looked like "normal" people. The point of this paragraph is just be cautious. Be sure to park in the main parking lot (to the left of the restaurant) or on the street right in front of the restaurant--don't park far. Like I said, the neighborhood seems a little dodgy. Anyway, we ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito de Machaca. It was a good sized, wet burrito. It tasted pretty fresh and I only wished that it had a little more cheese, that would have made it perfect. It's also a portion fit for two people, especially if you're not the biggest eater like me. We were thinking about ordering some side dishes, but based on the reputation of huge portions, we thought we'd just attack only the burrito and be satisfied. So like other people, we came here because it was on TV. It was worth the trip and I would come back. This cozy restaurant does bring a family-owned feel and I believe it's high quality Mexican food. I wouldn't listen to the people who bash on this place--it's well worth a visit.

As per recommendation of a friend's mom, we decided to have a culinary adventure and go here. This place is out of the middle of nowhere. Yes, this place is the size of a shoe box, but holy mole, was there a line out the door for both the take-out and dine-in lines. The take out line was going much faster, so we decided to stay there. I didn't seem like the dine-in line was moving much. The menu is LONG and extensive. It's a little overwhelming for first-timers. Prices are pricey at first glance, but considering how much food one gets, it's cheap. I order a Chicken Quesadilla, and my friend ordered some gigantic burrito. I have no clue what he ordered. So, we ordered, and grabbed a table outside. The weather was nice to sit outside. I think we were wating about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was served to our tables. I'm completely shocked on how huge my quesadilla was. It was absolutely delicious, but I could finish half of it, and I saved the other half. It warmed up quite well the next day, but I ran out of sour cream. :\ Oh well. This place is well worth coming again. Bring your appetite AND your patience. Wait times might be long, but well worth it. Tasty tasty tasty, and if you eat like me, you can easily stretch out one meal into 2.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE El Tepeyac!!!!  I was first introduced to this wonderful place by my fiance who grew up in Boyle Heights and I have loved it ever since.  This place is small so there is always a line, usually doesn't take too long to get a seat, but we usually sit at the counter and there is no wait.  They also have an outdoor patio open for dining a take out.     I need an El Tepeyac fix at least once a month so I have sampled many things of the menu...and they are all good.  I usually get the Okie De pollo.  This is a huge burrito.  Easily 8 or 9 inches long, 5" across, and 4" thick.  I am a big eater and in my fatter daysI have come pretty close to eating the whole thing, but now I limit myself to half.  It is stuffed, and I do mean stuffed, with tons of fresh real guacamole, chicken, beans, cheese, jalapenos, rice, and onions.  If that is not enought it is smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce....MMMMMMM, I can taste it as I write this(note to self:must go to El Tepeyac soon).  They also have two very good salsas and really good Horchata.

When I used to come here as a little kid I hated it. Why? Because I had to wait so damn long. I was a kid so I'd get bored and I was hungry and there was always a wait. But when we'd sit down I'd forget about that because I then focused on the biggest burritos I'd ever seen. My brother and I would always ask if we could get our own Manuel's special and, with a firm "NO" we would end up sharing it and still not be able to finish it. My dad would eat everything it seemed, including what was left of our burrito. Sure there's other stuff on the menu. But who cares. You need to come here, order a big ass burrito, lay back in your chair upon eating what you can, take a deep breath, hold it for a sec, then exhale. You have just completed consuming a piece of Southern California history.

The husband finally took me in this past weekend after talking about it for years. The line outside went pretty fast and the neighborhood is not that bad, but maybe I'm used to it from growing up on the hard streets of Rosemead. Yes, that's a joke. Real cozy and tiny inside. We were seated at a table in between a group of middle aged construction workers and a girl with huge boobs in a tube top. The giggling, whispering and turning of heads constantly kind of distracted me from my food a little bit.. I mean, I love a nice set just as much as anybody, but sheeesh..trying to stuff my face here. If you go, do not make the mistake I did by ordering a 1/2 side of guacamole (huge bowl!) with chips, and then the taquito plate. We barely made a dent in the stuff in front of us when she brings out the taquitos with the gigantic pile of quac on top. Yikes! Yes, the portions are huge. The rice and beans were tasty and the chicken in the taquitos was all white meat and they were the good fat ones. Next time, I'll try one of those burritos everybody is going on about.

After 200+ reviews you know this is a sacred place. It is literally, a whole in the wall joint that attracts all types of people. After watching the Man vs. Food my family decided this was a place we had to try. We drove up to East LA last night to watch my sister play vb and after all 10 of us caravaned over here. Warning: NO PORTION CONTROL HERE! My sister and her bf shared the Manuel's special to realize that the thing was bigger than her head! I had the chicken taquitos and took half home. Wonderful all white meat chicken and the beans and rice, just like my gma used to make. My mom had that Chile Rellano and my husband and dad had the Gringo burrito (i think that's what it was called), my brother in law had the enchiladas. Everything was delicious!!! Even took home enough for lunch and dinner that next day. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is that there should be a warning outside telling you that will commit a sin coming into this place! Tip- Order from the Take Out window and sit outside. The line to eat inside is way too long. And be careful if you bring kids bc its not in the safest neighborhood. All in all- it is something you must experience. Delicious homemade Mexican food, but on steroids!

Besides its huge portions, food is not that great. It doesn't matter if they have been around for 55 years....food is just mediocre at its best.  Burritos and tacos all lack flavor. I've tried it twice and each time I've tried 5-6 different dishes with my friends...not one single dish was worth coming back for more. Sorry, Manuel, this is a no-go.

My friends and I decided to try out this place after seeing it on Man vs. Food. Arrived there at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and the line was already building up. Waited for about 30 minutes until we were seated. First impression of the restaurant inside was very cramped. Sat down and ordered the Carne Asada Burrito. Two of my friends shared the Manuel's Special and another friend had the Bean and Cheese Burrito. My Carne Asada Burrito was very good and the meat was very tender. It came with a side of fresh guacamole and when I say fresh I mean you can see chunks of avocados that was just freshly cut because it still holds its nice green color. A lot of other places that I have been to, their guacamole tends to be more runny, but not at this place. The Manuel's Special Burrito was ginormous!! The rice and meat was oozing out with deliciousness! I was very impressed to see that my two friends were able to devour almost the whole burrito. The only thing that bugged me the during my entire meal was having to sit very close to someone else and every time I would use the knife to cut my burrito I would always bump into his elbow and vice versa. It got kind of annoying after couple of times of bumping elbows. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and will be coming back soon to try their other yummy burritos.

Manuel's oh how I love you so. I have been going here since I was a little kiddo and you have never let me down. You are always there when I need some comfort food. Manuel is always there himself to give me a hug and kiss and make me smile when I am waiting in line. The food is always fresh and delicious. Huge portions. I know everyone loves the big burritos but I prefer the tacos, taquitoes and chilaquiles. Their guacamole is fresh and homemade and they give you a mountain of it. The service is good. The waitresses have worked there forever. It is nice to see the same faces every time I go. When you are done with your meal and pay your bill Manuel always gives you a tootsie roll pop, a tootsie roll, and a bubble gum. If he really likes you he will give you a extra special treat. :)

I like the food if they serve you what you ordered. Usually it's wrong. Toss a coin. Either the place is great, or it really sucks. Service can be slow and indifferent. Sometime really good and fast. If Manual himself takes the order expect it to be 100% wrong.

This place is amazing. HUGE BURRITOS!!! The wait staff is friendly and it's impressive if you can finish more than half of your burrito. I suggest any of the Okie Burritos for that fantastic enchilada sauce that coats the burrito. Come hungry because you'll need all the room you can get in your stomach.

I love El Tepeyac. Sometimes I get the Hollenbeck de machaca and take it home with me.  We have long talks about politics and music... it sleeps next to me on a red velvet pillow.  I friggin' love this burrito. But seriously - you won't find a better burrito in LA.  Best described as a steaming load of shredded beef, guacamole, beans and rice; Thanksgiving in a tortilla.  Some people will tell you "Quality over Quantity" - but Manny'll give you both. Make sure to be hungry.  Or pay the consequences.

Been coming here for as long as i can remember! Drive the extra for this place. I think its as good as it gets and by the look of the lines i know im not the only fan!Very Big portions, i usually get the taquitos platter (which comes with a heaping amount of avocado)and im full for days and sick of avocado! haha i don't know a mexican place that is generous like that! The only reason i gave it four was cleaniness...dont go to the bathrooms cuz its a scary sight! I always come armed with sanitizer! but other than the long lines(only long if you want inside seating) im good with the patio seating.It usually doesn't take long to get a seat you just gotta be fast it may not be the loveliest places but hey the foods great so thats fine with me!

Goddam Manuel wants to feed you!!!! I have never in my life seen an Burrito so huge and there is no sparring on the cheese especially when you ask for extra cheese. The food is excellent and in portions that are hard to finish. It has a great vibe and the service is quick. Just make sure not to go here at prime dinner and lunch times as you might be waiting for a long while to eat. Also make sure to pay your respects to the memorial in the parking lot.

I was going to hold off on writing a review for this place, but saw how there were 666 reviews! Oh no! We can't have that so here I am putting in the effort to change that horrid number to 667 :) This is going to sound ridiculous.  I live in Camarillo, which is at least 40 minutes away from this restaurant.  It says a lot about how good the place is when I'm willing to drive out just to get a burrito.  Love love LOVE the Hollenbeck de Machaca burrito.  It has the essentials of a burrito plus their moist, savory shredded pork goodness, which would be the machaca.  GET IT.  The burrito is huge, thus you can definitely share it with another person.  Their guacamole does look like an appealing option, but really, would you really want to just stuff yourself with avocado when you have so many other dishes available?  The burrito comes with guacamole so don't fear that you won't get a shot at the green stuff. Good and friendly service.  I have gotten a sweet server each time I have been here.  Okay, and I know this place is (I'm just going to say this mean word) ugly on the outside, but please don't judge a place on how it looks.  Their Hollenbeck de Machaca burrito really is the best burrito I have had.  No joke.

The buritos at El Tepeyac are more renowned for their size than their quality but that doesn't mean this place isn't worth a trip. If you were to put together a fun eating tour of LA, El Tepeyac warrants  consideration. You can avoid the line by ordering around the side and eating outside but don't. Sitting inside is an essential part of the experience.

Two words for you MANUEL'S SPECIAL!!!!  My friend introduced me to this place and I just love the HUUUUUUUUUGE burrito that is the Manuel's Special.  Its a wet burrito full of meat, cheese, salsa and guacamole (beans and rice if you want) and the size of my head.  I am a big eater and I probably couldn't finish this thing cause no joke its a monster (I feel an eating contest/challenge with my friends coming on).   I am giving this place 5 stars on this dish and this dish alone (well the chips and salsa is pretty darn good too), I can never get myself to order anything because the MS is such a great deal and it taste so good.  A new tradition that my friends and I have now is stopping by this random place in a slightly ghetto area on our way to Dodger games.  Every time we break out the plates, forks, salsas and the MS we get looks and get asked which stand did you get that from?  So believe me folks if you and your friends are hungry.  Or if you are just THAT hungry and in the area, make your way over to El Tepeyac and make sure you are wearing stretchy pants.

When you are presented with a bowl of guacamole that is big enough to swim in, remember.... ...there is only one. When you are met with a burrito that is the size of Lou Ferrigno's forearm, remember.... ...there is only one. The name El Tepeyac has been used by others, but remember...there is only one real El Tepeyac and it is guaranteed to rock your world.  Hard.

This place is the iconic place my old roommate brought me to in the middle of the night for a snack... It was in the middle of East LA, so back in the early 80's it was like "where the hell are you taking me?"...  "Manuel's"... I don't think that they're open til 2 or 3 in the morning anymore but the burritos are still huge as always, about the size of your foot (lol!).  Pretty good wet burrito, I usually settle for the Hollenbeck but this time I wanted to try the Hollenbeck de Manchaca which has pulled pork meat, rice, refried beans, guacamole, salsa, covered with red sauce, onions, and green chili peppers.  I usually order at the take out walkup window on the side and takeout or eatin along the breezeway. This place is iconic... an institution that everyone knows about and for good reason.  Everyone talks about this place and Ciro's across the street as the places to go to for good Mexican comfort food.

I've been waiting years to try this place.  I was one of many who came to this restaurant after seeing it on Man vs Food.  I was glad I tried it out!  When we arrived, there was a line of about 10+ people.  The line moves really quickly and it is worth the wait.  The owner (Manuel) was at the front of the line talking to people as they came and left.  He's a very funny man with tons of energy! Our table ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito (pork with chili verde) and the carne asada burrito.  The portions are HUGE!  The original size can feed 2+ people.  I ended up only eating 1/3 of my dish.  Both the pork and beef burritos were delicious, but in our opinion, the beef was a tad bit better tasting than the pork.  They gladly wrap up the food for you to go. I also ordered the 1/2 lb of fresh guacamole and chips.  The chips come with two sides of sauce - red chili and green chili.  Both are delicious and home made.  They give a LOT of guacamole!  It actually looked like it was closer to 1 lb of the guacamole!  The chips are home-made and fresh. Also delicious was the fresh horchata (rice drink).  Tasted fresh, clean, and nicely sweetened (not like a packaged mix).  The waitress was very fast and friendly.  Everyone made you feel like home.   She was very grateful and even left us with some bubblegum and candy with the final bill. The restaurant also has a take-out window at the side of the restaurant.  Very very helpful and the food is quickly prepared.  It's kind of helpful, as inside the restaurant, there are ~12 tables and ~10 counter seats.  Not too big area. Great food for the money. I especially liked how the waitress yells the order to the back kitchen.  Makes it even more authentic!    I'll be back!

I like this place. There was a line outside the door when we arrived, but luckily some spots at the counter opened up and we nabbed them since no one else wanted them. We walked inside to find that this place is really small and crammed full of bodies lol. Literally every possible spot was taken up by chairs and tables, leaving only the minimum amount of space necessary for walking around. The counter was nice though. The stools are fixed to the floor, so each person has his or own set area (I have personal space issues lol). We ordered the Hollenbeck de Machaca and Okie de Asada. The Okie came out kind of cold and the Hollenbeck was barely warm. My wife likes her food piping hot, so she was a bit disappointed, but "barely warm" is good enough for me, so I was a happy camper. Even though the burritos look ginormous, ours were mostly filled with guacamole (like half, no joke). I like guacamole, so that was okay with me. As a result, we were full, but not overly stuffed when finished. Service is great. Its a really friendly atmosphere and the service reflects that.

Always great food. Hit-or-miss customer service. I grew up for the first 13 years of my life in Boyle Heights and El Tepeyac (and subsequently the Manuel's Special) was a staple on Sunday mornings. I've always loved the food, and given the reception of all the Yelpers, I don't think I need to go into further detail on that. Today I tried the menudo for the first time here. It's only made Friday evenings and on weekends, so hop on the opportunity if you get the chance. The broth was very deep and rich, with striking notes of lime and herbs. The "nasty bits" of pork were very tender and flavorful. The hominy was cooked to perfection and added a nice foil to the other melt-in-your-mouth flavors. The horchata, as always, was on point. I can go on and on about this place, but the reason it doesn't get a 5 is because I've had numerous experiences with the staff forgetting orders or not being very attentive. Today, my friend's order was forgotten (he ordered a Manuel's Special to go) and after 30 minutes of waiting (the dining room was completely packed, as was the to-go line, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were just busy), we asked them how much longer the food was gonna be, and found out they never started it. This wasn't the first time, and it sure isn't the last time they'll mess up the order. Luckily for them, the foo speaks volumes about the quality and care they take in executing their recipes and that's enough for them to still get a 4 in my books.

I don't eat here as often as I used to (something about not wanting to have a heart attack...) but I still indulge at least once every other month or so. The plates are huge, and the burritos can feed a small army any day of the week. I live about two blocks from here and when I'm running especially late for work, I always make up for it (and distract my boss) by bringing in a Machaca Manuel's Special as a breakfast treat. The food is authentic, and they offer all the traditional options, all of which are pretty good. It sucks that there's always a line, though. If I don't feel like waiting, I opt for sitting in the patio section even though there's no waiter service.

Just another LA Institution to add to my list of reviews.  Again, I will keep these short and sweet to minimize the obvious. Manuel's is a special place, especially if Manuel is there pouring out shots of Presidente into your coffee cup in the morning.  That'll make your breakfast extra special! The first time I came here a while back, I was sitting at the counter with my brother when I learned of the Hollenbeck and Manuel Burritos.  I ate a whole lot more back then and didn't blink an eye at the calorie count because it didn't stick around.  Oh how I miss the metabolism of yesteryear.  Anyway, I didn't even want to try it back then even though I could probably put a pretty good dent in the Manuel's if I really tried.   So while eating my regular burrito, this older lady comes and sits next to me at the counter and was an obvious first timer like me (very starry eyed and kinda wandering around).  She ended up next to me and was asking the waitress all kinds of questions that I don't remember what they pertained to.  The one I remember was when she asked what the Manuel's special was and the waitress said in broken english a lot of descriptive words about the burrito but the one that caught the customer's ear was the word FREE.  So the lady ordered it thinking she will get a free burrito if she finishes it even though I know for a fact that she didn't really understand the description of the burrito.  I couldn't wait for that burrito to come out.   When the waitress brought out the Manuel's special, the customer's eyes popped out and she looked for a moment that she didn't believe she had ordered what was in front of her.  That burrito was spilling over the sides of the plate and was just massive.  I've never seen anything like it.  She then backed away and said to the waitress that she didn't think it would be that big.  I laughed out loud because it was funny, period.  Then she did what I felt deep down inside someone like her would do.  She sent it back and said she didn't want it because she didn't want to pay for it.  What a *#&%*@!   She instead got the Hollenbeck and ended up eating half of it and taking the rest home.  All the cooks were giving her the stink-eye after that so I think she got a booger or 2 in her Hollenbeck.  haha. Jk.   Anyway, I thought it was a funny story. Go to Manuel's, the original location and enjoy the atmosphere.  What have you got to lose?  As a consolation, if it's too busy, you can go to Ciro's across the street and enjoy their food because it rocks over there as well!

This is a small neighborhood restaurant. It gets raves for it's burritos, hard shell beef tacos, taquitos, and chili relleno. The food is basic "East Los Angeles." Home style "Chicano" food,  everything is served with refried beans and spanish rice. Most dinners are served on big platter style plates and the meals are generous. You'll want to stick with the basics here. Don't get fancy and you won't be disappointed. Stay away from the seafood.....order a burrito or a basic combo plate. Come hungry and eat lots of chips. They also have some of the best guacamole in all Los Angeles. This is not gourmet mexican food. Its not "upscale" food. You won't find this stuff all over the city. Just some places. It's meaty, cheesy, greasy, fried,  chili drenched, comfort food goodness. The place is small, cramped, and can get noisy. The jukebox is sometimes too loud with horrible mexican music coming out of it, the waitresses have been working here for years. Pictures of family and locals line the walls...as well as photos of certain Boyle Heights cultural touchstones. This place is historic...its part of the fabric of the city. You either "get it" or you don't. If you do...and love a good wet burrito, order an Okie or a Hollenbeck.  You'll be coming back for many years.

Oh, this place is delicious! I had the Okie Carne Asada Burrito and it was enormous!  No exaggeration. What I did (and I suggest you try) is ask for the rice and beans on the side. They normally come in the burrito.  Also the addition of sour cream was stellar on my part I must say. I'm from San Diego and finding a burrito in LA that comes close has been a challenge but El Tepeyac so far is the best. If you think I'm knocking LA on it's Mexican fast food, you're right. A draw back is the wait time. I tried to eat here once before and the line was around the block. Today, we walked right in and had a seat. Great service too. Eat here.

Man vs. Food.  The reason we came here. Walk in and you see a very small dining room that would probably remind you of a small bar in the middle of Mexico City.  Not saying that's a bad thing, it adds the the ambiance and the feeling that you are truly eating something authentic.  We went with the sit down service (you can get walk up window service right next to it) on a Sunday afternoon.  We went at the right time because 10 minutes after we were seated, there was a 10 person line.   So... what did we get here?  The Manuel Special  What else?  On Man vs. Food, he describes to us a huge 5 lb burrito that he states, is "full of flavor".  Normally you'd expect not very much taste or not a great quality burrito out of something so monstrous, but they do not fail in delivering this novelty of a blow to the gut with a decent flavor.   I will always love and be biased towards Lolita's  Taco Shop in SD, but this place still delivers with something enjoyable.  We had 4 people share one burrito and all walked away stuffed.  Not only was the Manuel Special HUGE, but the normal burritos are also a pretty decent size.  If you got 3 people, go for the Manuel and share it, otherwise, go for the normal. The Asada leaves a little more to be desired without the hot sauce but still not bad.

My friends and I ordered the carne asada Manuel special. The burrito was at least as long as two forks and stuffed with a ton of meat, beans, rice, and guacamole. It was topped with salsa (that was unfortunately really watery and made the tortilla a bit more soggy than we wanted it to be) and mozarella cheese (when we really thought cheddar might have been better). Probably the best part of the meal was just the sheer size of the burrito. The three of us were barely able to finish it. The rest was just A-OK. The restaurant has a really cozy home-like feel. Our waitress was really sweet and laughed at us & told us we'd never be able to finish it! Overall, it was fun to try, and I might come back when I'm up for another burrito adventure.

El Tepeyac. The Original. This is an institution you MUST try once and return often to! Actually, I come here only for their addictive taquitos (preferably with beef) and the phenomenal guacamole that they generously furnish in abundance. I don't think this review needs to go into too much detail. What I'm recommending is very straightforward, will be well worth the trip (I live 30 miles away) and, well, let's just say it's DAMN GOOD! Besides, you can't be from L.A. and NOT have at least a passing acquaintance with them! So haul your fat a$$ there and eat up. EAT!

Yes!  I love Yelp!  It's been 7+ years since I've lived and worked in LA, but thanks to Yelp! I've rediscovered all the great restaurants I loved when I lived there.  I was part of the crew that would make the lunch runs to get the food and bring'em back to the office Downtown.   I'd agree with most of the folks raving about this joint.  Come hungry, the portions are huge (and delicious!) !!!

I agree with fellow Yelpers: The wait was awful and very long 45 min-1hr. But, after sampling the taste bud glory of the Hollenbeck Burrito, I am completely satisfied. I couldn't even dent this thing, and I mean it's huge; People aren't exaggerating that it won't fit on a plate (it takes 2). The flavors explode in your mouth, the meat is tender and juicy, the beans and cheese ooze from the tortilla - it's just sloppy perfection. If you haven;t been there - GO, if you we're told it's not good - GO, if you are skeptical - GO!

I've only ever heard tales of El Tepeyac Cafe. Burritos the size of an infant child, etc..  But as a K-Towner, its hard to get me to leave my little comfort zone. But this weekend, we made the drive to East LA for burritos. I did my research and thanks to the recommendation from Los Angeles Magazine, went with the machaca burrito (the standard size- which is still larger than burritos from most other places!)  it was DELISH! shredded beef & scrambled egg mixture with beans.  Seemed more of a breakfast-y type burrito to me, but delicious nonetheless. my boyfriend went with the chicken burrito in the larger size (the size of a cafeteria tray!!) Shredded chicken, tons of cheese on top. He liked it, I thought it was just ok. Total was about $30 which seems INSANE to me to spend on burritos. but then again, we had enough leftovers for the remainder of the holiday weekend.   go with the machaca burrito! will not disappoint!

Total disappointment!!!! After all the hype and pics posted on yelp I was super excited to try this place out... to bad the food was a little less than mediocre!!! I ordered the okie burrito, they should change the name to "ok" burrito cuz thats what it was, O-K!!! The enchilada sauce tasted like it was out of a can and the asada was loaded with fat!  I've had better burritos @ albertos!!  Guac was ok and horchata was nothing special... The only thing thats kewl are the huge portions.......

So I saw this on Man Vs. Food I went for my birthday, (on my birthday i went on tons of food adventures) And I got the 5 pound burrito. I dont like the area much. The place was small. But it was really fun in there. The customer service was great. Manuel is awesome. The burrito was HUUUUUUUUGE!!! It was definitely the largest food product I have ever seen. It fed my whole family of 5, and we still didnt finish it all. The taste was pretty good. The meat was juicy and the guacamole was awesome. The downside, everything else was bland. But I had a good time. I probably wont go there again till they build the second one in City of Industry. Just so I can get it again with my friends.

3.5 stars and I rounded it up. We Ordered the Manuels Sepcial Steak Picado and  1/2 order Guacamole with chips to go for lunch.  Shared with three of my co-workers, two guys and one girl.  Still had leftover which will be enough to feed one more person.  The burrito is covered by a beef stew kind of thing and had a good flavor.  The chip is a bit too oily.  A good place for burrito. Order to go if you don't want to wait in line.  They do have a parking lot which can fit 12-14 cars according to my informant.

I came here with my cousins to eat the jumbo burrito from man vs. food. It was raining and the line was out the door. Definitely worth the wait, especially if you've never eaten here. There is also a to-go window so if you dont want to wait in the long line to eat inside, the to-go window is fast and there are chairs outside to sit on. On tv it looked pretty big, but in person it was HUGE! They put the burrito in a extra long silver tin platters people usually use to cater. The lettuce and tomatoes took up half the platter length wise and the tortilla, beef (we got the beef burrito), cheese, and sauce was took up the other half. Overall, burrito was delicious!!!! It's a definite fork and knife type burrito which is different from the Cali burritos in San Diego. The marinade of the beef was delicious and  loved all the vegetables that you can just add. There was 7 of us that ate the burrito. Definitely would be good for 8-9 people. We were already full and there was still some left. We did eat chips and guacamole with the burrito. Highly recommend. The guacamole was delicious and when I got tired of just eating tortilla, I put some of the beef filling with lettuce and tomatoes on the chips. Delicious!

Mexican food done right!! I've been coming here for years and food is always good. The portions are big here so bring your appetite. The burritos are awesome here especially their Hollenbeck burrito or Manuel special. I usually get mine machaca style or with carne asada. Make sure to come early cause this place gets packed and expect about 20-30 minute wait during peak lunch and dinner hours to dine inside due to a limited seating. Take out is available for those who can't wait and seating is available in the patio area. When I'm in East LA, I always make time to stop by El Tepeyac for some delicious, authentic Mexican food.

Over-rated is right! The place only serves a limited selection of meats. They should add lengua, tripas, buche, etc. It's over-priced. $20 for the manuel special, come on!

This is where you take your friends who don't know a lot about LA if you want to impress them. This is where you take the uninformed, the inexperienced, and you overwhelm them with the sheer magnitude and power of FREAKING GIANT BURRITOS! The place is usually crowded, but if you can make it for lunch, you'll usually get pretty good service. The food is, as everyone else is saying, enormous, but not without flavor. For the price, it's really a good deal. The two best burritos are the Hollenbeck and the Manuel Special, which you should definitely order if you want the best experience (because other reviews have said the food is somehow lacking, and I'm assuming they didn't get either of these two) Anyway, it's a good place to eat if you're hungry, and a GREAT place to take your friends if they somehow haven't heard of it, or if they're not from the area. (so the 4-star rating would be 5 stars in the latter scenario)

Amazing value (lots of food). Decent taste. Good service. Line stands outside. Private parking lot. Not the best tasting Mexican food, but... They... Give... You... A... Lot. It was about a fifteen minute wait, they have a pretty small restaurant inside. What I ordered: Okie de Chile Verde Burrito the size of face: $9.00 Carne Asada Nachos doused in cheese: $9.00 Horchata: $2.50 All that + tax + tip. Took half of my burrito home, split the Nachos with a buddy. The summary: Everyone walking out the restaurant either say, "I'm stuffed," or leave carrying something to-go. Besides the amazing amount of food, the taste is slightly above mediocre. They do have the Manuel's special challenge, eat a burrito designed to feed 2-4 people within an hour. Granted that their regular burrito seems to be designed to feed 2 people, that means you're eating a burrito designed to feed 4-8 people, in one hour. If you win, free shirt and photo on their wall of fame.

I've been coming here since I was just a teenager! Before the MvF craze! My dad, brother, and I would come here and share a Hollenbeck burrito with an order of taquitos. The stewed pork they put on and in the burrito is delectable. Juicy tender cubes of pork with this delicious tomato based sauce and tender onions top this massive burrito pillow they call the Hollenbeck! It's awesome! The taquitos are a little pricey, but when you get the plate and you see the mountain of guac which accompanies your 2 taquitos it all makes sense. Although I have noticed that the mountain of guac seems a little smaller than I remember when I was younger. Nontheless this place is def worth a try! I will continue coming here as long as Manuel is pumping out great food. Did I mention the Manuel Special is great as a birthday burrito cake? Pop a few candles in that baby and you got yourself a bday cake better than any real cake lol

The title of this review should be the best, because, Manuel's is the best.   Not only have my parents been taking me to Manuel's since I was a little whippersnapper in diapers, they used to go to Manuel's when they were dating 30+ years ago.  This place is truly classic and among the elite landmarks for eateries you must try.   Where to start?  I guess with the tacos folded since those are what I religiously order.  Two freshly fried corn tortillas filled with the best shredded beef around, fresh sliced & diced lettuce and tomato (always super fresh and crip), and some fresh shredded cheese.  They might sound simple but these are the best tacos ever.  Rice and beans are also served with the tacos and they are not your ordinary rice and beans either.  As you know by now, El Tepeyac has been around for days, they have rice and beans down to a science.  I hate to keep saying they are the best, but seriously, everything about this place is so fn good. Before I write 18 pages about the guacamole, let me just say that it's the best I've ever had (after mine of course :) )and stop myself right there.  -  fresh avo, tomato & onion with the perfect amount of salt and lemon... clean, simple, the best Another magnificent item that you may have read about in another review that I have to vouch for is the Hollenbeck.  It's a massive burrito filled with slow cooked meat, tomatoes, onions and peppers and it's own juices, rice and beans.  It's monstrous. Just like my Lucky Boy review, I feel the need to reiterate  this point here, DO NOT, I repeat,  DO NOT eat a Hollenbeck by yourself and go on a long drive.  Take my advice, you'll thank me later.  :)

Quite possibly the greatest burrito I ever had! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty: the carne asada, the rice, the tomatoes, the guacamole, the sour cream, the cheese, the red enchilada sauce, and of course, my favorite, the cilantro. This restaurant is a really nice, small tidy place located in a little neighborhood in East LA. Adam Richman once ate a 5-pound burrito, all by himself, and has a Manuel's Original t-shirt to prove it. Lo and behold, 3 friends and I ended up ordering the 5-pounder special burrito (which got us admiration from a table of females next to us). We obviously finished it (barely). I requested a t-shirt, but was generously denied. Oh well, I tried. On a side note, the salsa in the burrito had a hint of spice, but the good kind of spice that even a 5-year old can handle. Overall, this place is a 5-rating in my book because of the quality of the burrito. The service was also very friendly. The wait for us wasn't long at all since we came early. Ignorantly, I downed my Horchata beverage as the only downside in ETC - MO is that there is no bathroom. But with food that great, who needs to go to the bathroom? I can honestly say that I can give a 5-rating because after I ate my 1 1/2 pound portion of the meal, my stomach was not even bothered the whole day. I can't wait to go back.....

oh hell! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO THE HOLLENBECK?! I can deal with the rise in price.  that's just normal.  But eating this classic i would think that i was eating bad italian food.  It didn't taste like the classic burrito, It tasted like it was covered in spoiled (sour) marinara!

Anything under 5 stars is just wrong, this place is some of the best Mexican food in L.A!  I've been going here since I was 5, Manuel still gives me a candy bar every time I go =) I usually order huevos rancheros or chicken taquitos.  They are VERY generous with their servings and their delicious, fresh guacamole.  There's usually a line but service is good and fast so they get people movin' in and out pretty quickly.  Worth the wait =)  Enjoy!

This place makes me proud to say that I have some Mexican blood running through my veins. In all their delicious enchilada sauce, gigantic burrito, beautiful guacamole splendor I can say I am a big fan. I have been coming here all my life and can honestly say that I believe Manuel's is the BEST place for Mexican food. (Other than my momma's kitchen.) I don't care if I have to wait outside to be seated inside. I don't care if the thugs in the parking lot are scary. And I don't care if the hungry people ahead of me in line are getting rowdy. All I care about is when I am finally seated and that plate of beef enchiladas and eggs sunny side up are placed in front of me, I am in Mexican food heaven. It is impossible not to leave satisfied. The food and service live up to the hype, and if you don't think so, go ahead and get your head checked. Go on, i'll wait.

Everything is very well done. This was first time having machaca (the platter), the meat was tender, juicy and very flavorful. The combination with refried beans and tortillas somehow accentuates the meat, turning the machaca into a potentially addictive habit. Seriously consider adding a serving of the guacamole; that extra flavor will guarantee you clean your massive plate (way past your stomach's fill point). The highly-recommended hollenbeck carne asada burrito was very large but did not meet expectations; the sauce on top was not as rich or flavorful as anticipated. Especially after tasting the machaca, it was near impossible to go continue eating the burrito. I think Okie style seems to be a more tasty option. Topped off with a cup of horchata, spiced with a bit of cinnamon, it was a very satisfying and VERY filling meal.

Ok...one arbitrary night, Grace, Dean and I decided to hit this place up because I love the guac and chips.  Not waiting long. we got to the counter and here's the review: Atmosphere:  It's nestled in a little neighborhood.  Good parking and it's cozy to say the least.   Price: Reasonable.  $4.95 and up type of stuff.  The serving sizes are Jumanji so it's again reasonable.   Food:  Carne Asada burrito:  Jumanji.  I had no chance of finishing it.   So I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day.  A meal x 3 for the price of 1.  Win win in my book.  It was also very tasty too.  How that Man vs. Food guy at that burrito is beyond me.   Guac and chips:   No brainer.  It was delicious.  I think this alone messed up my appetite before my entree arrived.  Oh well.   Service:  Very quick and friendly.  Had a very family vibe to it.   Food came quick and with a smile. Verdict:  Just because it's in the 'hood' is no reason to go.  It's not bad at all.  Food is good so that's what you have to remember.  It's worth a visit or three.

If there was a reason why the stereotypical view of a Mexican is a fat bearded fella with a sombro sleeping under a tree it's because they just finished off a Manual's Special from El Tepeyac. Now with a couple other locations the original still holds strong as one of the best places to eat in East L.A. But that's only because Yelp doesn't have the technology to follow all the movements of the 'roach coaches' that wander around the land serving up tasty tacos. I'm reading a lot on here that folks are afraid of the area because it's those mean streets of East L.A. Maybe I'm just used to the area living near it for the majority of my life but I really have never seen anything bad go down near here. So pay no mind to the warnings of the area. Besides, after eating here you'll be well prepared to meet your maker. The place is small and you will have to wait in line outside at peak hours and even most non peak hours. But it's worth it. Tuesday was when it was always closed but I swear the other week when I drove by there was a line outside on a Tuesday. Maybe they couldn't read a closed sign? The burritos are great, have they be on the super human portions that you have no chance in hell in finishing off. That's not to say that large portions make good food. You're not losing anything in the quality when you're bumping up the quality. Forget the outside dinning here. It's really taking away from the experience and from my attempt to try it once, the taste in the food was slightly different. So brave the line and you'll be rewarded with your just desserts.. or at the very least a huge serving of good Mexican food.

El Tepeyac is located on the border of a residential part of East LA, near a cemetery and some of their main streets.  There is street parking available without meters.  There is indoor seating with tables and chairs as well as a counter.  They've also got a small patio available outside.  It's not a fine dining experience, but it is an experience to eat there.  It's a community favorite. I've only tried their Manuel's Special One Foot burritos.  They taste ok, but nothing amazing.  People I know love them, but really... I think it's the novelty of the size.  The burrito contains rice, beans, and guacamole.  It's topped with lettuce, cheese, sauce, and tomatoes.  The cost varies depending on which meat you pick, if any ($20-36). They have an extensive menu including several vegetarian options, however after my visit I confirmed that they use lard to cook their rice and beans.  For that reason, I would not recommend it for vegans or vegetarians.

A+ on history, they've been cooking since the beginning of time. A+ on nostalgia, it looks like they've been so busy, they never had time to remodeled. A+ on no nonsense service, have to be with such volume. A+ on portions, absolutely huge!!!!!! No grade on food from me. Gosh, I just wish I liked boiled shredded beef. If it were the seared grilled beef, it'd be an A+ too. No such options. That's just me though, the line that stretches way outside says the food is just fine the way it is.

Many moons ago, a co-worker and I ventured out for lunch.  We went way out of our way (and didn't get into trouble either) to experience the burrito. The sucker was served to me in a foil lined storage box top!! I ate from it for several days.  It was very good.  However, I can say that it seemed more like they were trying to win the 'biggest burrito' contest rather than turning out a knock-your-socks-off type of burrito. Do they still serve that behemoth of a burrito?

My buddy is a hardcore biker and I am a marathon runner so consuming large quantities of food isn't necessarily bad for us every now and then. This place was on Man Vs. Food, so you know the quantity is going to be there. AMBIANCE: The place has a homely diner feel to it. There's a counter with stools on one side and tables on the other. Rustic wood walls brings out a more countryside feel to the area. It was somewhat loud but was tolerable. FOOD: We shared the Manuel's Special with Carne Asada. This thing is a beast. This thing could easily feed 4-5 people. It tastes great, too. Thank goodness. Otherwise, our meal would've been hell. Juicy meat and a good amount of guacamole, beans, and rice. Can't beat that. PRICE: Value!! For $20, we had our fill and some leftovers for a second meal. SERVICE: Our waitress was pretty cool. She explained the differences between the different Manuel Specials. Food came out quick! THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're like me and more cautious regarding nutrition, ignore that part of you for one night (or go for a nice workout prior) and try this place out! Food is great and you will NOT go hungry.

My family has been coming here for over 40 years.  They've always called it Manuel's though... don't know why but we refer to it as Manuel's... Food is good but I think it is more legendary than good.  When I ordered the the torta de guacamole I thought I was getting an avocado sandwich - boy was I surprised when I got an avocado omelette - Pleasantly surprised because it was so good.  I know my family loves the HUGE burrito and the taquito's but I'll stick with the omelette.  I won't go outta my way to eat here but if I'm out that way and someone wants to stop & eat, I won't protest.  But maybe after reading the review that mentioned that it's not the cleanest place, I might think twice...

I grew up eating El Tepeyac. My mom used to bring home the Okie burrito for me OR their yummy tacos. There's a smaller location in Alhambra off Palm (near the Costco there). So, I already knew what I was getting myself into by FINALLY visiting the OG location in East LA. There was a line going way around the building... its a small little "mom and pop" shop so its hard to get a table especially during those popular eating times. We got a table probaly within 30 min. I ordered the Hollenbeck which is TO-DIE-FOR. It is very moist and tender and oh so yummy with all the fixin's inside. The guacamole adds an extra nice flavor to the burrito. The hot sauce is very good as well. Everyone else had the hollenbecks as well.. one other person ordered the Okie. Everyone with us was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. My mom will come to this location to pick up the Manny's Special for office parties and such. GREAT idea to share it (like a party sub). Perhaps I will do that for my work when we have our next event! Carne Asada, Machacca, or Carnitas all the way! I'm craving it... perhaps we'll take another visit tonight!

Ok so here's the thing. Went to El Tepeyac for my 21st birthday. My friends and I were alll excited because of the huge burritos. I got a simple bean and cheese burrito but they attempted to split the Manual Special. It was good for a laugh but the food itself is only just ok. I mean as fast as our food came it's obvious that they just have vats of refried beans, cheese, etc. sitting in the back and it's more assembly than preparation. I tried to eat more of my burrito the following day and it was just not good. I got a bit nauseous actually. Good for the *experience*, but probably won't go back.

I used to go around searching for the Chipotle that is most generous with their portion sizes because that meant I got a bigger burrito. No need for that now. Chipotle ain't got nothing on El Tepeyac Cafe's Manuel's special. Their XXXXL burrito was delicious. Me and my boyfriend shared the chile verde burrito and we gave up after eating half of it. We were defeated by our giant burrito and had shame written all over our face. Reason why I say this is because our waitress checked up on us every so often and i'd catch her smiling as she was walking away. She probably thought we were naive for thinking we could conquer the burrito like Adam Richman had. The wait wasn't bad for a Wednesday lunch. Decently packed though and there was a small wait. The owner, Manuel even came around and kicked out a table that was just sitting around after they had finished paying for their food. I wasn't too impressed by that but he redeemed himself afterwards by offering my boyfriend and I free tequila shots that we kindly turned down. Definitely try this place out when you're in the area but make sure you come on an empty stomach or with a big group of people!

5 star for the people that work there... we were fortunate enough to have an awesome waitress who popped our cherry since it was our first time there... SA-WEET... 3.5 stars for the food... it's aiight. Averages around 4.25. It's like I stepped into a set of the Land of the Lost since all the portions were bigger than a Black Man in a room full of Asians. What to order: The Manny Special (Pork): $16.00 bucks. The only bigger will be the turd that comes out later... About 5lbs of pure MEAT MEAT MEAT that will make you NOT want to be on a Lo-Carb diet... evvvverrr. This burrito was just OKAY... not too much flavor and the meat was kinda dry and flavorless... the only reason this is worth buying is to see if you can bet your friends you can finish it and hopefully win some money. The taquitos: *sidenote: i didn't order these, but the dood next to me sitting at the bar had them, and they looked so good and huge. These looked like my obese aunt's fingers... wide and chubby. Even the crunch sounded appetizing and I sooo wanted to order it... too bad I had to worry about preventing a F*CKIN' HEART ATTACK from trying to finish my Manny Special...

Theres too many good Mexican food restaurants out here to rate this past 3! Maybe my gripes is more with the CUSTOMER SERVICE than it is the food! I guess if your with a large posse than this place will do the job, jus slam a few coronas first, to fool your taste buds. I came here the other day with a friend and ordered the hollenback burrito I opted for asada instead of pork...  it came back just a plain burrito nothing on top of it, I said I didnt order this, the guy at the register says " oh wrong order" then he hands it back to the cook on the line and he throws pace picante on it and hands it back. Ooookay... so I stared at him for about 6 seconds and my stomach yelled "jus let it go fanon!" so my friend and I sit down with looks of misery on our faces and dig in( mind you we were kinda ok not kinda really hungover) to this pile of rice and peanutbutterthick re-fried beans, the meat was abysmal the pieces that were in there were fat & gristle, no flavor no salsa no cheese just a piece of I dunno on a plate... My freind who's puerto rican says "the guacamole's the best thing on the plate, I said " I was gonna say the same thing", we both looked at each other again and couldn't take another bite of the nonsense. We walked away angry and unsatisfied. Ended up going to Tamale Liliana's btw :)

Went to this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon to sample their hollenbeck burrito. I ordered the beef one and my wife ordered the chicken. Both plates arrived in a timely manner smothered with lot of salsa. Almost to the point the burritos were floating in that salsa. I gave my wife a half and she gave me a half. This way we sample two for the price of one. The portions were very generous. The service was bare minimum (no refills offered on our soft drink or water). The price was very reasonable. And that's were the positives end. Both burritos contained a very small portion of shredded meats. Barely enough to fill a soup spoon. The meats were tasteless. Our burritos were mostly filled with rice. Very little bit of re-fried beans. Ended up by scooping the meat out and leaving much of the rest of the burrito on the plate. We declined the doggy bag! Since we left this place dissatisfied, we headed to El Taco Llama and had their burritos. We enjoyed them much better than at this place. If we are in the area, we might give this place another try for fairness. However, we will not make a major effort to go there.

Whenever I'm feeling in the mood for a heart-attack, I come here for the Hollenbeck Burrito.   The place is a hole in the wall and it hasn't really changed throughout the years. They get people in and out pretty quick and the staff is friendly. I pretty much only eat the Hollenbeck burrito or split the Manny's Special with somebody (The Hollenbeck's bigger burrito brother). I like it's flavor and the portion is huge.  The price is fair. It's kinda cool how Manny will come by and have a shot with you as well. I make special trips just to come to this place.  You gotta try it at least once.

I have always loved El Tepeyac and always will.  I've been oing there since I was in high school  And I go back all the time.   El Tepeyac is one of the best Mexican restaurants in LA. I don't care how far away you live, the food is well worth the trip.  View the website, then click on "menu."  EVERYTHING is good here.  I suggest you try horchata with your meal.  This rice-based beverage is the perfect traditional beverage with Mexican food. http://manuelseltepeyac.… Convinced?  Great, enjoy your meal.  A new El Tepeyac is opening in Industry:  lucky residents!

After hearing so many positive things about El Tepeyac, I was excited to try it out, and I was very hungry. So my friends and I got there and waited in line for about 30 minutes. Once  inside we were shocked at how small it was. I asked for chips and salsa and had no idea that they charge 3.50 for an order. That is ridiculous. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for chips and salsa, that is usually complimentary. My bf and I ordered the chile verde burrito to share but ended up getting a burrito with red sauce instead of green. It was good, but not great. I definitely recommend ordering the guacamole on the side because there was a disgusting amount of it inside our burrito. So much to the point that it overpowers the taste of anything else. The burrito was large enough for us to share and both be satisfied. My friend asked if there was any hot sauce such as Tapatio or anything but surprisingly, they didn't carry any hot sauce! So make sure to bring your own. The service was awful. Our server took forever to bring everything. Once she brought the food, she never came around once to check on us. We had to flag her down to ask for refills. Then once we were all done, my friends asked for a small box to go it took about 15 minutes to get that, then she never came back with the check. We had to flag her down once again. Overall, the food was OK. I've definitely had way better burritos. I think this place is overrated. Don't buy into all the hype.

So in Chicago, there's this taco joint called La Bamba that proudly claims that they have "burritos as big as your head". They clearly haven't seen the burritos at El Tepeyac. It's guaranteed bigger than your head and could be mistaken for a log. I have yet to stray from the Hollenbeck. It's hard to tear myself away from such a good thing. Chalk it up again for my former coworkers back in the day...they really knew how to take care of me when it came to lunch. I love the dining room! I would affectionately call it a hole in the wall, but it's the perfect hole in the wall - so comfortable and homey. And when the weather is nice the outdoor seating is a great option.

Damn!  Have some mercy on yourself and realize before you arrive that the portions will be huge, and even superior to that, very tasty.  Not much I can say other than that you'll get great service, delicious Mexican food, a nice atmosphere, and all at a very reasonable price. I went there for the first time today and I was impressed.  Still full.  Probably will be full all weekend after eating that Hollenbeck burrito.  Wowzers. Give it a whirl.

A-ok cuz thats what it was.  Let me explain The wait was around 20 minutes, we arrived on a monday at 1205.  Not bad, so we sit down and are greeted by manuel himself offering us shots as we walked in the door (he was pretty cool for an old guy) not sure if it was free or not but being that it was 12, and were not big drinkers, we passed. The food My girlfriend ordered the horchata, she said she had better elsewhere (i confirmed) We ordered altogether 2 tacos carne asada which were pretty good (king tacos are better, alot better) Taquitos with shredded beef (she said nasty i think they were great) with FRESH GUACAMOLE! (very good we both agreed) I ordered the Steak Picato, sadly, like most of the yelpers say taste wasnt like "WOW" it was okay.  The meat had lots of fat.  The size is HUGE.   Altogether, the best part of the experience was the home feeling of the resturant, manuel himself whos an awesome guy, you can tell hes greatful for his success.  Definetly not the 23rd tastiest place in america, that would be very sad if it was true.  Would we come back? Yes, but we'd stick to the Carne asada tacos (2 for 7.00)  And fresh guacamole 3/5 stars 5/5 for manuel!

The orders here are huge so if you don't each much I recommend you share your order. I had ordered the Carne Asade Hollenbeck the sauce it was in was okay, it seemed a little bland for me. However, the meat and guac that was inside was really good . My dad had ordered the Okie Carne Asada Burrito and the red sauce that came with that was a lot better. During our meal we decided to order a side of chips and salsa. The salsa came right away but our chips never showed up. We even saw the basket of chips sitting at the pick up window and no one went to get it. We had to ask a few times before we finally got a chips and this was about 20 mins after intially asking for some. We got lucky when we got here we were seated right away. All in all if I was in the area and the line wasn't too long I wouldn't mind to come here again.

I went to this restaurant w/ 3 other friends and the 4 of us just ordered the Manuel Special along with nachos ... and MAN were we full.  The Manuel Special is like a MASSIVE burrito and definitely worth splitting because some of us didn't even finish the portion.   We had to wait quite awhile to get in because the restaurant is pretty small.  The wait was probably about 15-20 minutes but while waiting we got to talk to this lady behind us who was a regular and she was telling us oh this is normal.  Being Mexican herself, she still came out here to get herself some authentic, yummy Mexican food.  So she definitely said it was worth the wait.  I agree :).   If you don't want to wait for the line to be seated there's also a side window where you can just order to go and sit outside too :). The customer service was awesome the restaurant is quite cozy and the waiters/waitresses were all really friendly and nice.

I ate at El Tepeyac earlier this year on my birthday with my family. First of all, it really is a hole in the wall type place. Thats not necesarily a negative. Its popularity and the fact that it is tiny means there will be a wait, most likely a very long wait outside on the street. Again, its all good. Its what you expect from a local mom & pop type place. The Good part is that the staff was very friendly. The prices are dirt cheap. The food really did have a homemade taste and of course the portions were enormous. The So-So part is that the food tasted only OK. In fact it was a bit of a letdown. Nothing tasted bad, but with all the buzz and hype we were expecting something that really knocked our socks off. It wasnt bad, just not worth a trip to Boyle Heights. Maybe if i lived in the area i'd frequent it. The bad part, and the reason i knocked it down a star is that the dishes were very inconsitent. Four of us ordered the same dish: the Hollenbeck Burrito with pork. Some of them were mostly meat and little avocado and some were mostly avocado and little meat. You'd think that four exact burritos ordered and served at the same time would resemble each other.

I'm a glutton for punishment!!! I went here today for the third time and experienced the exact same dissapointing results.   Every time I went here, I tried a burrito.  Every time it's stuffed with tons and tons of stale ingredients and tough meat.   The burrito is ridiculously big and ridiculously expensive.  The service wasn't bad.   After waiting in long lines, we sit down at the "bar."  All three times, I took two-three bites of my burrito and pushed it aside for the waitress to pick it up.  She asked me if I'd like it to go.  I said no, it tasted plain and the meat was tough.  She goes, "oh okay" and takes it away.  Hint hint: I wanted you to take it off of my tab.  So El Tepeyac, instead of you taking the awful burrito off my tab, I will write a review here explaining my god-awful experience at your so raved about Mexican "food" establishment.  I consider myself well-experienced with Mexican food and trust me when I say this: do not go here.

"Wow" is all I have to say. I would not have figured this hole in the wall to be so good. Absolutely massive portions. For ~$12, my girlfriend and I shared one of the manny's special burritos and we each had our own drink. The burrito was obscenely large. It would be enough food for 3 very hungry grown men. Like lumberjack men. We didn't even get through half of it. And best of all, it was good. the chile colorado was perfectly cooked and tender. lots of real guacamole. lots of gooey cheese. and it wasn't soaked in oil. The service was great too. The waitress was very quick, and refilled our drinks multiple times without needing to be told. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because of the limited seating and lines. It's a crap-shoot trying to get in here. I've tried eating here 3 times, and I've given up twice after waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a table. Go on a sunday in the early afternoon. Don't go on a friday or saturday night or you'll be waiting forever.

My buddy ate an entire "Hollenbeck" burrito which we all praised him for at his funeral a week later. I have been here thrice.  And everytime ordered the pork burrito.  I don't care that I can't finish it.  It's still amazing in flavor.  As I remember, I got full just eating all the extra meat they put around the outside of it.  Then cut the burrito in half, and then half again, making 4 seperate burritos.  Not bad for like $15 or whatever it is.   If anyone here said they've finished it, call BS on them, unless it's Kobayashi or something.

Best hole-in-the-wall Mexican in East Los!  Do you like guacamole?  Because this place drowns you with it and I love it!  Huge portions, cheap prices and a family atmosphere.  I used to attempt to eat their regular burrito, but it's so incredibly huge that I could never (I'm a pretty small girl), so I've found other options that allow me to enjoy the food for longer than two bites.  I usually switch between the chile relleno and the Torta de Guacamole burrito.  The chile relleno is the BEST I've ever had.  I've ordered it at other places wondering if they could top Manuel's, but I have yet to find a better chile relleno.  The Torta de Guacamole is filled with guacamole, egg, onions and other yummies, but no meat, which means I can eat more of it.  My husband and I usually get a side of beef taquitos and guacamole, just to make sure we get our fill.   Besides the food, what I love about Manuel's is the atmosphere.  It's a tiny place, but there are pictures of the family all over, a juke box in the corner and Manny greeting people at the door.  He'd typically punch my husband in the shoulder and then give me a wink.  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Los Angeles.

Having seen this place on both Man vs. Food and on Anthony Bourdain, we prepared ourselves for the well known wait.  However, traffic was heavy and we went too long without eating so our tummies weren't willing to wait as long. We hit up the to-go window instead of continuing to wait.  What a nice option for such a busy place to have!  It's understandable that the line is slow moving- legendary burritos and because it's a small original kind of place.   These legendary baby size burritos are enough to leave a group of four feeling satisfied.  I believe the show's said they are five pounds and they really are.  In fact, ours came in the cardboard bottom of a Sam's Club size Monster energy drink purchase & it took up the whole length! It was a very yummy and filling burrito.  If you love guacamole get one of these classic burritos.  They have a ton of guacamole (mostly big pieces of avocado).   Remember when looking at the around $20 price that this could be four of your meals or a good time with three friends.

The only place where burritos are to be savored. El Tepeyac makes enormous burritos. The Hollenbeck burrito is in a class all by itself. I was first introduced to this little cafe by friends form Long Beach who'd family makes the drive on a regular basis just for dinner. There is no other place like it. It's good to get there a little early as it can get quite busy. Even with a wait the turnover is fairly quick. Maybe the best Guacamole in Los Angeles. I could go on and on.

I just got back from lunch at Tepeyac, where I put my body through the cardiovascular equivalent of a triathlon. As I type this, I'm debating whether to close the door to my office and sleep it off for an hour, or just call it a day and head to gym to atone for my gluttony. To be fair, I have no one to blame but myself. I come here every couple of months for lunch with coworkers, and we all gorge ourselves beyond the point of discomfort. It's a barbaric ritual that I'm not entirely proud of. The funny thing is, I'm not a fan of burritos and the food here is inconsistent at best. So why keep coming back? For the same reason that I serve dry turkey every Thanksgiving -- it's comforting. A couple of words of wisdom. First, order the machaca burrito or machaca plate. Machaca is the name of the game at El Tepeyac. Secondly, and it's clear that I'm incapable of following my own advice here, draw a line down the center of your plate and eat only half.  Take the rest home.  There's no shame in restraint.

I saw this place on man vs food (like others on this review) and it was a must try just by looking at the huge burritos they serve. my cousin and i went and ordered the manuel special. i remember in college there was this burrito place that advertised their burriotos were as big as your head... this burrito is as big as your 1 year old baby. I had my doubts because just because it's big doesn't always mean it's going to be good. i actually expected it to be bland but surprisingly it was very flavorful. we ordered the pork (recommended by the waitress) and split it in two... it did not disappoint. unfortunately i couldn't finish my half... came up several bites short. i know i know... maybe next time.

I only take people I like to this place.

This place is famous for Manuel's Special. It's a huge ass burrito that feeds about 5 regular sized Asians and 3 very hungry Asians. The Burrito is like the size your your head and I believe it's 5+ pounds. The Guacamole Chips are also very good. It has a very fresh taste to it. Parking on the other hand is a pain in the butt during busy hours. They do have a private lot but it does get packed and if you're not a very good driver you might run into some problems because it is kind of tight. There are plenty of parking around the neighborhood though. We had a group of 7 people and we had to wait awhile. It was about a 20-30 minute wait. Well worth it though. If you come here with just one other person it'll be a quick wait. Manuel seemed like a very nice guy. He was joking with us when were in line and when we sat down. I even saw him offer some shots to some regulars.

Like many things and places in Los Angeles, El Tepeyac is really more about memories than realities. . . . . . so one day back about 1967 or 68 one of my Dad's truck drivers is telling him about this great place to eat on the East side.  "Great Burritos Frank, big with anything you could want."   "OK', my Dad said, 'pick me up two each for the boys and one for me and another for the wife." "These Burritos are big Frank, people usually split 'em." My Pop tells the guy fine, just pick us up three, the kids are big eaters.  I don't know what he told the driver when he saw the standard paper supermarket bag half full and requiring two hands to handle, but I do remember the thing came complete with a stack of paper plates, about ten plastic forks, and enough napkins to diaper a baby rhino.  Dear Lord, were those babies amazing.  Full of beef and pork and cheese and avocado and, zoweee! My first personal visit was a couple years later acting like an East Side College kid in the mid 70's.  El Tepecyac was always a grand place to take an out of town visitor to demonstrate my street creds as an LA local and a veterano of all things east.  It was also pretty safe due to the fairly steady stream of LAPD cops from nearby Hollenbeck  Division. Things started to change a little during the Clinton Administration although I'm not certain it's fair to attribute the changes specifically to slick Willy.  There was a time back in the day when Manuel would offer some of the diners a belt, usually tequila, (no booze on the menu), just as he probably would have at home.  The last time I was there, maybe three years ago, Manuel was still around but the jug had been replaced with a plastic jar of candy from Costco. The chow, while still fresh and quite good, wasn't quite the world beater I recalled either.  The big Manuels Special seemed filled with rice rather than meat, the Machacas dry and the enchiladas stingy.  My fave, the Hollenbeck pork, was still terrific; saucy and full of pork chunks.  Prices, a little high for what you got compared  to other places serving the same basic fare.  Overall a worthwhile experience at least once, but not one I go out of my way for any longer. These days, I take visitors to La Golondrina or  El Cholos, (either location), for "atmosphere", and maggies.   If they are foodies, we head to La Casita in Bell.   If they really want the "experience" we do a taco truck or hit King Taco after a Dodger game.

I heard about this place on the the Travel Channel's  show called  "Man Vs. Food". So I thought it would be fun to go there with friends and family . We get there and Manuel meets us at the door entertaining us with comical conversation and genuine interest how we got there to celebrate my friends engagement. After chatting with us for a while, our wait in line didn't seem that long (the place is pretty small so prepared yourself for a wait if you want to eat there but there is a take out line too). He got our party of 10 inside where he served us beer in order to celebrate correctly (I must mention he didn't charge us for the beer. So thanks Manuel). When it came down to order the service with most helpful to cater to our large party . Most of us ordered "The Manuel's Special" knowing it was going to be huge but to my surprise it was waayyyyy bigger then I ever imagined, I mean small infants have weighed less then this burrito.  The meat had impeccable flavor, texture, and was not overly seasoned.  The guacamole, beans, rice, and Meat ratio was superb. I can't tell you how happy I was eating there.

Go.  Go now. Breakfast or lunch, you will not be disappointed.   This place used to be a Sunday morning tradition for me.  There's a reason for those long lines outside, right? The burritos are the size of footballs.  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.  Try the Hollenbeck.  Breakfast?  Everything is good.   Remember, there is a reason that this place has been popular forever.  It's very, very good.

This is a landmark restaurant in Los Angeles. It is known for their gigantic burritos. Ive seen this place on Man v Food and they can attest. I came here before a Dodger game a few years back. I was introduced to this place by a friend who said it was one of the best that the city offered. We waited in line for about 20 minutes. The place is tiny and they told me there is always a line. I had the burrito. It was the regular size one and was huge. I couldn't finish it. Was about $10. Flavor on it was ok. Wasn't anything to write home about. Ive had much better. I guess its good if you want to experience this landmark in East Los Angeles. I can honestly say that I was a little disappointed.

Manuel's El Tepeyac on Evergreen... Makes me full just thinking of those monstrous burritos. If you're in the Boyle Heights area, GO and you won't be disappointed. Expect a line because it's a pretty popular place. Especially since Man vs Food ruined it for all of us who've been going there for years... Oh well. I always get the machaca burrito. MY FAVORITE. Shredded beef, eggs, onions, rice and cheesy goodness. This burrito can cover me for TWO meals. No lie. And I can hold my own... And this isnt even the Manuel's special machaca which probably would feed me for 5 meals. It's good. Try it. Respect the tried and true joints of Los Angeles. There's a reason they have withstood the test of time.

I have yet to actually eat inside the joint. We usually just saunter up to the takeout window and either eat at the little side tables or take our spoils to go. After my dad took my bf and I to the Giants/Dodgers game (go TIMMY!) we headed to El Tepeyac, because I knew a big guy like my dad would LOVE some cheap and good eats. Ended up taking everything back to my parents' hotel and shared a nice family style meal. Even their "normal" size burritos are huge...the Manuel special is pure crazy.

The hollenbeck, the quesadilla and the occassional guy selling the DVDs are the reason why I come here! (for the record, I do NOT purchase these DVDs). The burritos are really good in general but the Hollenbeck really does make this an experience to remember. The location is kinda ghetto, but it feels safe... you get me? Like you know, feels like home kinda but not really... yeahh, you know what I mean ;) What I would recommend is to get the Quesadilla, and the Hollenbeck and split both w/ a friend.  You get the perfect amount of variety and portions. The guacamole and rice is really good here... the shredded meats are flavorful, overall a decent dining experience... and a place where everybody should try.

California natives flock from everywhere to make the pilgrimage to El Tepeyac, where they bow down to the Hollenbeck special. As they chant , "Yum!"  These angelinos blissfully enter burrito nirvana and recount fondly the numerous times they savored these ENORMOUS burritos con carne. El Tepeyac Cafe is an East LA landmark, well-known for it's Hollenbeck & Manny special. It is a hole in the wall cafe well regarded for its GIGANTICO burritos. Each burrito and food dish feeds two people. The burritos and the food portions are enormous.  This place serves up authentic Mexican food with big dish portions at a super-reasonable price. Take your appetite or some friends that can help you eat a burrito. You'll be in burrito heaven or in a blissful food coma chanting, "Yum!"

Damn you Adam Richman and your show. I went this morning and got seated right away. This place is tiny.  10 tables, and 8 seats at the bar.  I'm not sure how the place looked so much bigger on TV. I ordered the machacha burrito.  The regular sized burrito says it feeds one, but it's got to be a two pound burrito.  I could barely finish it.  The beef was well cooked, and stewed for hours.  Add the rice, beans, egg, and it's party in my stomach that weigh like a ton of bricks after I got out of my seat.   I have to come back to try some of the other dishes here.

THIS IS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT! I have been coming her since I was a young child.  It's literally a part of my family.  Manuel (the owner) is the most charismatic man you will ever meet.  Everyone calls him Uncle Manuel and when I was younger, I thought he really was my uncle.  Whenever possible, I'll have El Tepeyac cater a party.   The Hollenbeck burrito is my favorite.  Eat here!  You won't be disappointed.

I'm so lucky that I live very close to El Tepeyac. The food here is just amazing and you could never go wrong with any item on the menu and  the prices are very reasonable. Also they now accept credit cards. My favorite has always been the Manuel Special burrito. You can feed a small family or in my case feeds 2 very hungry guys with that. My best friend and I came here last night and took one home plus a 1/4 order of guacamole and chips. We totally consumed the whole thing in a matter of minutes.

I have been going to this place since I was 5 years old.  This place is amazing!  The food is some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The burritos are huge and always filled with nothing but the good stuff.  When it comes to burritos this place is ranked top in my book. My order:  Machaca burrito with extra cheese on top.  One order of guacamole and 1 quesadilla to share for the ride back with family.

Okay, it is man vs. food and food won on this trip. The Hollenbeck De Chile Verde is simply too big for one person and if we better knew what we were getting into we would have shared on of these. The pork inside of one of these is amazing -- large chunks that I would have thought to be only found in a chili but here they are in a burrito. Another one of us at the table had a simple Cheese Quesadilla and it was just as huge as the burrito! Service was great and it certainly has a wonderful family feel to it. I do not know much about the neighborhood but going there for lunch and being able to park in their own lot made us all feel safe enough.

We were excited to go to El Tepeyac ever since we saw it featured on Man v Food, because my husband couldn't resist the temptation of taking on one of Manuel's Special burritos. I like Mexican food, but he could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and still love it. That said, he got about a fifth of the way through his Machaca burrito and couldn't eat a single bite more. Not because of the size of the thing, but because it was so tasteless and dry. We waited outside for that? I got the Carne Asada quesadilla and the meat quality was really bad. I had about five mouthfulls and two contained chunks of gristle and fat. The flavor was pretty bland although the best thing about it was the cheese. This place was a huge disappointment. I think we'll be sticking with our local SFV Mexican joints from now on.

My best bud took me, El Burrito Aficionado, to this spot a couple of months ago. The indoor dining room is really tiny, so naturally, there was a line that formed outside. It didn't help that people celebrated birthday parties here, hogging all the tables and taking their sweet time, singing, laughing, taking pictures (posing w/ the giant burrito or remnants of it), opening presents and so on, but I digress. Being a party of three, we waited about 30+ minutes until we got sat. While waiting, we were entertained by a couple of hood people fighting over parking. One of them started yelling at the parked car and started to spit on it. I found that very entertaining especially since the car couldn't defend itself. But I digress. This place is known for their HUMONGOUS burrito, which according to their menu, feeds about 4 average size civilians. Of course we ordered the HUMONGOUS Manuel Special de Machaca and the regular size Hollenback Burrito. The food was seasoned well and everything tasted great. I have no complaints about the quality, and I sure as hell don't have any complaints about the portion. Goodness, I couldn't breath after eating, and we still had quite a few leftovers. I only give 5 stars to places that I frequent, so I can't give this a 5 star yet. If I'm in the neck of the hood again, I'd definitely drop by and try the other stuff on their menu. Oh, I failed to mention that their wait staff are really nice ladies. Make sure to tip them fat. Salsa Rating: 4/5 PRO: El giante burrito, friendly service, great price, good portion, other items on the menu look good for future trips. CON: El pequeño comedor, long wait outside, in the ghetto.

My favorite mexican place by far!!! All the food is good.  I always get a wet burrito and share it with my brother since it is too big. So tasty and soooo much flavor! The staff treats you like family every visit.  They give out candy to children standing outside. They are so sweet.  It is tiny inside so there's usually a line. I always go out of my way to go to this spot.

This place really had the homemade feeling to its food. I recommend the pork Hollenbeck burrito. It was tasty and the portions were huge. I also recommend their shredded beef taquitos. They are generous with the avocado throughout :) My husband tried the steak okie burrito. The sauce they put on top was not our favorite - it was oddly sweet. The actual meat was pretty good, so we wished that the sauce had lived up to the potential. Manny, the owner, was there and he was a total sweetheart. Is it the best Mexican food I have ever had? No. I leave those spots to my mom, grandmas and tías. However, it's pretty good and worthy of at least one visit.

EAT TIL YOU EXPLODE! This place serves burritos almost the size of a Shoebox! I always work up an appetite for a few days before coming to this great ICONIC Mexican joint. Even then my husband and I have to share a burrito. Nothing fancy inside, no focus on decor, but great food. Tender meat, soft tortillas, and spicy sauces. The waitresses aren't too friendly, however I can overlook the attitude a little as long as service is good. Try the Manuel's special (a burrito that can literally feed 3-4 hungry men! ) if you dare! You have to try this place at least once while in LA.

This place is so so. There meat was mediocre. I went there last weekend to try out this place. Saw so much reviews and on TV about this place. I had to come. Ordered a Burrito with eggs and steak. Forgot what it was called but the shreds of steak that was in the burrito were soo tough I felt like I chewing on some dried up beef jerkey. It was not easy. The salsa was good though very flavorful but the steak was really dry and stringy. I was not impressed. They also use a gang of lard. My friend ordered a cheese quesidilla cuz he wasn't super hungry and that sucker had more oil coming out than iraq did. The staff was coo and there seemed to be a bit of the die hard people there. The portions won't let ya down and i'm all for portions as long as they're damn delicious. But I felt like my shit wasn't fresh. It seems like there's a lot of filler. There wasn't that much meat in my burritto and definately more beans and cheese then there was of anything else. The people next to us had the manuel special which is pretty ridiculous in size. I wasn't interested in it after I had the steak shreds. It wasn't horrible but I had wayyy better mexican food at other establishments. sorry to do this.. really wanted to like this place.

Lets just start with.. Omfg, they're burritos are huge! I remember in middle school coming here with my classmates, and yet again in highschool. The mexican food is good but the top notch item is the burritos. Not only are they crazy big but they are stuffed to the max with beans, guac, cheese and tons of meat. Atleast 4 people can eat it i'd say. If your starving or have a large appetite then maybe two people. This is a small restaurant so be prepared for it to be packed. Everyone is so nice and friendly. Even if its your first time there they'll act like youve been a customer for the last 50 years. Parking you can smell the food. Yum! Your tummy with immediately begin to growl. If your looking for a place to blow your mind and good left overs for the next day this is your place. Now mind you not every item on their menu is big so be prepared and ask the waitress fi you arent a regular.

Yes, this is the El Tepeyac that is featured on "Man vs. Food" as well as the Travel Channel's "101 Tastiest Places to Chowdown" (#23). It's also an LA institution, having been around for 55 years and if you live anywhere in the LA area, it is something that must be tried. True, there are other fine Mexican restaurants that have similarly amazing and delicious food but I dare you to try and find another establishment that serves baby-sized burritos. And no, I don't mean that there petite and cute, containing the inexplicably charm of "silver-dollar pancakes." I mean that they are the size of a healthy, chubby baby. In fact, it is wasn't for the pounds of cheese and enchilada sauce, I probably would have mistaken the giant tortilla for swaddling cloths. The place has an always-filled parking lot but there is a quick turnaround so you can usually find a spot within a minute or so. There is also always a line to get in. Unless the weather is terrible (rare in this part of the world), or unless you would prefer the convenient way they serve extra plates and the burrito at the center of the table with a knife (needed due to the aforementioned burrito massiveness), I would suggest ordering at the outside window which has a much quicker turnaround. You can snag a table on the outside patio, or get the food to go -- which sometimes isn't a bad idea as several of the patrons appear to be regulars that are a little too regular and appear to take on some of the massive qualities of the burrito. I usually opt for either of their classic burritos, the Hollenbeck (served with chunkier salsa and a little drier) or the Okie (served drowned in a sea of enchilada sauce). Everything appeared to be good though -- including the guacamole and chips which make a great side to share. Keep in mind that all of the portions are enormous and you can either get something for yourself and eat it for your next four meals, or you can share between about three people. Similar with the guacamole -- they give you enough to ballast a ship and a half-portion is large enough to share between a good sized group. Viva El Tepeyac!

Saw this place on Man Vs. Food so me and a couple of my buddies decided to come try it. We ordered the 5lb burrito for 4 people. The burrito is simply amazing, stuffed with rice, lettuce, guac, tomatos, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and slow cooked beef. We killed this giant burrito within 25 mins. Be warned there is always a line to eat inside the restaurant, so we always go to the side window and just order there to go but they have tables outside for you to eat on. Definitely a good place to grub when you are starving.

Heard about a 2lb burrito and it caught my attention. As far as taste goes. Its pretty good, but it costs allot. 18 bucks for some but the asada burrito is 23. I mean definitely worth a try. Feeds 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are. Place is really small. I guess getting seated depends on how lucky you get. Parking lot is ok neighborhood is... well its not scary but its definitely not beverly hills. If your local stop by every now and then, service is good, food tastes good too. But I'm from the OC so the drive here and back is a little out of the way. Probably wouldn't get that burrito again tho haha i mean for 23 bucks you can get like 4+ regular burritos depending on where you go. So that's about the same if not more.

This place is an old family favorite. I remember coming here as a kid whenever we were hanging out with la familia on the East side. We'd all pile in the caruch and trip over to Evergreen. Enter, say hello to Manuel Sr. and get our grub on. Manny was always hospitable and awaiting you with a shot of brandy or whatever lit you up. I was here recently and things are the same. The food is excellent! Funny thing, you NEVER have to ask what's good here because, IT'S ALL GOOD! The only place that could even come close? Lilliana's tamales in East LA.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. El Tepeyac is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant.... maybe even my all time favorite place to eat.  I've been coming here for years (and my father for over 30), so I think I could literally drive blindfolded and still get there.   The burritos are epic.  Huge, delicious, quality ingredients.  The hollenback is a great traditional favorite with pork strewn about the top, but I also love to get the Okie (yummm enchillada sauce and cheeesseeeeee).  The guacamole is to die for, so make sure to order chips, salsa, and gauc when you go. The horchata is perfect.  Many places have watery horchata, but not El Tepeyac.  It is perfectly strong and sweet. Come here with a big appetite, and be prepared to wait in line. Also, if you dont want to wait in the long line, just go to the side window, and either get your food to go, or eat it in the patio!   This weekend I was craving it on the way to meet some friends at the beach, so I got an Okie to go.  Sitting on the beach with an El Tepayac burrito may be the best combo ever.   Everyone was jealous.

What can I say, this place is an institution. When I lived in Hollywood, I used to come here for Sunday morning breakfast and was amazed at the service. From order to the counter in less than three minutes! My favorites are the chili relleno dinner and the Hollenbeck burrito - both of which are to die for. Love the taquitos, too, as they really pile on their thick, homemade guacamole. If you get here at the right time of day, there's usually a parking spot waiting for you in their lot. My only complaint is that they serve you a litle to much food but I can live with that! To sum up: quality food at fair prices with excellent service.

I grew up down the street from this place, and some of my family lives across the street from it now. I can't find anthing bad to say about Manuels (what tepeyac is known as) I live their machaca burritos, and their large plates. the inside is small, that's why there will ALWAYS be a line and if you're smart you'll call your order in and just pick it up. During lunce I will never show up, too smart for that. If you want to try some good food this will be the place to go. Manuel the owner is a flirt and he will make you take a shot if he likes you, but he likes everyone, especially the ladies.

What brought me here? Watching the Los Angeles segment with the awesome, gorgeous, and foodie... Adam Richman from Man vs Food. The place was small but easy to find cause there is a line out the door. We luckily found parking in the little lot and waited in line for about 10-15 minutes. Manny greeted my boyfriend and I at the door and showed us in. I practically started drooling as I inhaled all the aromas in the room. The boyfriend ordered the the hollenbeck and I the Okie de pollo burrito. Oh... my... goodness... I don't know why I was surprised at the size of this burrito when I had seen the episode on MvF.  It was so mouthwatering with the kick from the red sauce poured on top and you could definitely taste the love made into this burrito. My boyfriend consumed it all. I had to stop two-thirds in but when I heated it up in my little toaster oven the next day, it was even better. Manny offered us a drink in the form of alcohol and reluctantly turned him down. I only gave the 4 stars because I've only been there once and can't wait to go back to try new things and take that shot or beer waiting for me there. Hasta la próxima !!

Ive been coming to Manuels El Tepeyac for over 20 years. Unfortunately, ive decided to stop going there since the prices are now too expensive. My wife and I were yhere last week and the bill for 1 cup of coffee, taquito plate, and machaca plate came out to 32.00 without tip. The Machaca itself tasted very bland, normally I usually order the okie burrito which is fantastic. Very Sad :(

I have been going to El Tepeyac since I was a little one.  My dad started going there back in college and became good friends with Manuel, the owner.   If you get to meet him, he is a riot.  And he loves the pretty ladies.  I took a work group one day and he came out with the tequila wanting to do complimentary shots with us.  He said, "the shots will make an old man like me look better to you beautiful ladies!"     If you are looking for an upscale restaurant; this is not the place.  If you want good food, for a good price, and a home-like environment, check out El Tepeyac.   You can never go wrong with the huevos rancheros, the hollenbeck burrito, the chile relleno burrito, or the one you definitely have to share, the Manuel Special.   The only two problems that I ever have with El Tepeyac is: 1. There is ALWAYS a line outside!  Thankfully, it moves pretty quickly. 2. It's a CASH ONLY place.  They did install an ATM machine, so that makes things a bit easier. I see a lot of bad reviews of food being bland.  I've never had that problem there.  Anyhow, give it a chance and try the guacamole.  You will fall in love.  :)

Manuel's special really is good. And for that amount of food, $15 was a deal. Could feed 4-5 girls comfortably. There's a line to get seated, but once you're seated, the service is swift. Go to their take out window to get your food quicker.

The ambiance: Quaint and has a lot of character - you may have to wait a bit though because lines can be long. I really love these seemingly hole in the wall places to eat. =) The food: Pretty good - though the pollo was a bit dry and the asada was also a bit dry. The chile verde was very good though! The service: Very friendly and courteous. Perhaps it's just me but I always judge by  whether or not the waitresses come around to fill up water. I also love that they saw the group, knew what we were going to do and happily served our food, as if they were watching this "feat" for the first time! The price: very reasonable - a 5lb burrito is $15 -$18 and feeds about 3 people (depending on who you go with I guess!) I give it a 4 star because I'd come back, if motivated again. =)

Huge portions and cheap prices. I have been attending this place since I was a little boy.  My main dish are the Taquitos with a ton of guacamole. I have also gotten the eggs with Chorizo. The place is small and usually a line. This place is pretty famous as its not just attended by Hispanic people. I see all kinds of people coming to eat here. Their famous dish is the Giant burrito they serve you. I think Two people can easily eat of that and still have left overs. This place is in the Boyle Heights area so you are also close to Mariachi Plaza. Its probably even more packed now that MAN VS. FOOD featured it. It got ruined! nooo! Oh well, i guess its good for them so they wont close down.

The Manuel Special Burrito was the biggest burrito I have ever seen.  The food wasn't spectacular, but it was good.  As I looked around I noticed that the portions tend to be on the larger side regardless of what you order. You can sit inside and be waited on or order from the side window outside and seat yourself in the patio.  The lines weren't too bad either way considering it was lunch time. The Manuel was big enough for four people to share.  The price kind of reflects that too.  Chips and salsa were $2 more, but the drinks are refillable.  The prices aren't what you would normally expect for Mexican food.  One ginormous burrito, chips and three drinks set us back nearly $27.

I have to represent since Manuel's Tepeyac is in the heart of East Los. Up the hill and across from a church you will find this tiny little gem that cooks up authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices. I can vouch for their chilaquiles and beef taquitos w/guacamole. Portions are HUGE and prices are reasonable. It's a place definitely worth trying out! Oh, and if you're in the area and in need of an affordable flower arrangement made to order hit up Carmen's flowers down the street on Wabash (you can check out my review for that place). I have gone in several times with $25 and they have made me some pretty spectacular arrangements.. definitely recommend.

What else can be said about El Tepeyac Café in East Los Angeles? The place is definitely an institution - 55 years in business - impressive! Manny, the owner is awesome. After we passed on a free shot of Tequila he offered us a Twinkie and a glass of milk. He's a trip, super friendly and he definitely adds to the down home atmosphere of the joint. Overall, the service was excellent. The wait staff is friendly and polite and it's fun to watch Manny interact with each of the customers. The dude probably kissed 50 girls in a one hour period for crying out loud.   The food portions are ridiculous (especially for the price) and the food quality and taste are definitely above average. We ordered the chips and guacamole and it was literally served on a giant platter. The burritos (we all ordered the Hollenbeck) took up the entire plate and with the hot salsa were yum-yum-yum good. I got about three-quarters of the way through mine before I tapped out. The rolled tacos and enchiladas looked amazing as well and some couple next to us ordered nachos so big that they're probably still eating as I type. Honestly, I didn't go there expecting 5-Star quality but more so because it was featured on one of my favorite TV shows, "Man versus Food." It certainly didn't disappoint and I think people that rated it less than 4-STARS are basically clueless - seriously. I mean, you go to El Tepeyac Café for the culture, the tradition or even because of Manny himself - the food is simply a bonus. At least that's how I see it.

Holy guacamole is all I have to say. Their guacamole is made fresh daily so it tastes so much better. If you get the chance to see them make it, you will be amazed as well. It's literally grinding hundreds of lbs of avocado a day in a gigantic cauldron. The 5lb burritos are no joke, good for competition but not for single person meals. The quality like most people rated was not the best meat you can get. you rather get there regular burritos that will taste much better. Chips and guacamole, ginormous burrito, and a large horchata, really filling. Next time go with your stretchy pants.

Having see El Tepeyac Cafe on Man vs Food, I knew it was a place that I must try. I still haven't ate there but I was luck that one of my co workers brought a GIANT size burrito from El Tepeyac. The burrito was BIG enough to feed 15 people with enough left over to feed 10 more. It was stuff fed with tender shredded beef, rice ,beans, cheese and guacamole. It was amazing. They served two types of salsa, both were tasty and full of flavor, the darker red one packed quite a punch. I can't wait to stand in line and experience what it's like to eat at a true Los Angeles classic. I will be there soon.

Good lord they give you an insane amount of food! I had the regular carne verde burrito. This monstrous burrito was approximately a 1.5 feet long, half a foot tall and buried under a mountain of meat. The quality was excellent but was not a sophisticated dish. Rather, the food here tastes home cooked. It is the kind of food that makes you feel warm and happy inside. Be forewarned, there is usually a crowd outside. Be sure to poke your head inside and make sure they are out of space before you stand outside like an idiot.

No frills, not extremely clean but the food is OK. Would I go here again, NO! I went here with my friend (Blonde haired pretty girl) a table of latino guys stared at her throughout our meal while making remarks to one another in spanish. I gave them a look which stopped their BS for a few minutes. Once we exited this joint she got cat calls from a few guys across the street. Seems like natural blondes are a rarity in this part of LA, so If you hit this place up def get a burka (I'm kidding) for any blondes accompanying you.

My parents have been coming here since they lived in the 'hood back in the 1950s. To this day, Manuel still remembers them (or at least pretends he does!) and they adore this place. The first time they brought me here (their pocha suburban offspring!), I could see why. Look no further. This is authentic, Southern California Mexican food. It's pure East L.A. and it's AWESOME!   Get there early for a seat or you're gonna be waiting till lunch for your breakfast. If you're lucky, Manuel will come around and offer a shot to start the day right.

Manuel's wow thats an original! ..... thats the only place we wanted to go after playing little league down the street! As kids we would order the Hollenbeck or the Manuel's special burrito. The lines were always too long so we usually ordered to go! Each burrito was large enough to feed my family and a friend or two! This is an old school classic Mexican American place with a lot of history. Just like anything else there are now new and better tasting restaurants. Back in the day this was "the place",  and I still get cravings for those  extra large sized meals !  They even used to offer a free burrito if you could eat the "Manuel's Special"  in one sitting. (do they still offer that? and why would you ever want any more after that?? haha ) The flavors do tend to taste kinda the same, but the taquitos with fresh guacamole as well as the tacos are always a hit. If you try a burrito, know that its is a little more about "mass quantity"  than best flavor! However its still really really good. Compare it to a Tommy's chili burger".... there are many better hamburger places now..... but sometimes you just gotta have it!!  On a side note I was having breakfast at the counter, and a man who seemed to be the owner came over and started talking to me. He seemed  to have had one too many cervesas (one in hand)  , but he wanted to "thank you people" for the support over the years!!?? Well I can only imagine all the Japanese baseball leagues and Japanese Buddhist temples (Mexican and Japanese lived together for many years in Boyle Heights ) that had many a catered event from this classic eatery. Well I said to him ( representing all Japanese Americans feelings i'm sure! haha ) We have been coming here for years, we love coming here, and the feeling is quite mutual!...... thank you!

El Tep is one of my favorites places to eat.  Try the Huevos Rancheros, any of the burritos and ask for avocado slices or order their delicious REAL guacamole.  The food here is very flavorful.   If you come accompanied then sit at the counter.  The waiters will routinely ask customers if anyone would like to sit at the counter--take it, especially if there are two of you.  If your group is 3 or more then wait to be seated. .

Ginourmous doesn't even describe the size of their burritos. I had enough leftovers for two more meals! Really, really good too, I can't remember exactly what I got but it was vegetarian.

A delicious and cheap place to dine on interesting Mexican food. Their claim to fame are their ginormous burritos... as big as your head! I've been here twice. First time I had the Hollenbeck burrito. Excellent. Second time 4 of us shared the monster Manuel Special and a 1/2 order of guacamole which was awesome as well. Some Yelpers wrote that they allow byob and we brought a bottle of tequila, but they wouldn't allow us to bring it in to drink. Thus, 4 stars. A great place for those with huge appetites and the curious.

I always called this place Manuel's even though its official name is El Tepeyac.I've eaten here several times and all of them have been very good. It's cramped in here, a little dark, and sometimes smells funny. I can't even think of everything I've eaten here but they were all decent. What sticks in my mind though is their large portions guacamole (served with their taquitos) that's the best I've ever tasted. I don't remember the name of their huge burrito but if you do order it, share it with someone. I tried to eat it all myself but towards the end I was just shoveling food into my mouth instead of actually enjoying it. Now that I think about it, that applies to nearly everything that's on the menu, well of course, except the guacamole. This place is rated as cheap but if you're like me, you can't only order one dish. It's always taquitos w/ guac and something else for me.

If you are craving a big wet burrito then El Tepeyec is the spot. You should be cautious with your expectations because it is not amazing, it is highly mediocre. I had the Hollenbeck and it satisified my needs for cheese, rice, beans, salsa and heavy amounts of carnitas, but although it is not quite the size of the Manuel Special, it still proved to be a task to eat (and digest). On flavor alone, El Tepeyec could do better, especially being located in the heart of great Mexican restaurants. This place clearly establishes itself with a memorable experience do to their portion sizes. The staff is friendly and the place is popular so you may need to wait in line. If you must eat your Mexican food with a fork and knife then this place will suffice, however there are far better burritos and tacos across the LA metro area.

My girlfriend and I saw this place on Man v. Food a while ago and finally got to try it. Not the best Mexican food I've had but it's good. This place is a true hole in the wall diner. The service was so friendly and the atmosphere so genuine I felt like a child eating mama's Mexican food (even though I'm Chinese). At first I thought the prices were a bit steep, but then I saw how generous the portions were. $9 for the BIGGEST burrito I've ever seen in my life and $7 for two decently sized taquitos plated with a HUGE mound of guacamole... yum... definitely worth it.

This is the Original!  I remember back in the day after our "Turkey bowl" at church, gathering food for the hungry masses after our game.  We got the call for the "Burritos"  I had no idea, we hopped into a car and off we went for some Burritos?  Well, needless to say, we stopped off at Manuel's and came away with 2 or 3 burritos, which was a lot; of course this was only a portion to feed 2 teams fresh from our gridiron at Wilson HS. Fried Chicken from down the road at Dodger Stadium, and Burritos from Manuel's it was a feast to be remembered.  I was initiated, that fine autumn day! Over the years, Manuel's had held a warm place in my heart, not just from the heartburn!  Heehee!  I've had fond memories, and whenever I need to be humbled by a "real" burrito, I come here. Me, if I am ordering, it's usually a Hollenbeck or Okie, rice, no beans! More food for the dollar than you are willing to shake a fist at!

Wow, the best food experience I've had in a while. The staff were SO friendly and funny.  Especially the owner.   My huevos rancheros were perfect.  Rich sauce with peppers in it, nice refried beans, well-cooked eggs.  Got some roasted veggies on the side for a dollar and the plate of veggies was HUGE and full of flavor. Tried my friend's chorizo and eggs, also very tasty.  The chroizo had nice spices and the eggs were fuffy...even though it looked like there was more chorizo than eggs, it was well balanced.  I thought I tasted some anise in there.   I love this place. The atmosphere was amazing.  Everyone was treated like family.  I plan on going back many times and I hope each experience was just like today.

My husband took me here for lunch since we wanted delicious "authentic" Mexican to go.  He has been here several times and I've seen this place featured on Man vs Food so I was definitely curious. When we drove in to the parking lot, there was a LONG line already.  We were very relieved to find out that there is a separate window for take out.  We ordered the following: * Hollenbeck de Asada = delicious and totally enough for 2 people!  Usually, burritos are a little too much for us after few bites with all the cheese and grease but not the hollenbeck.  You will keep eating until your tummy finally scream out "NO MORE!" * Spanish Rice = LOVE it.  It's not those fake Spanish rice that's bland and hard.  They serve very flavorful, fluffy rice.   Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Manuel but next time, we will block off enough time to be in line and sit in the restaurant.   * Price = it seems it's on the expensive side when you look at the menu but just wait until you see the plate in front of you. * Location = honestly, i'm not really used to that neighborhood...BUT I heard enough good things (especially the fact that L.A. police officers go there all the time)  that I'm willing to go again. * Food = very good.  We do not eat much Mexican food usually but I definitely want to go back. * Service = pretty good.  We waited for around 10min.  A little long for a take out food but totally worth it.

After seeing this place on Man vs Food and seeing that massive burrito I had to try it.So this is how the story goes 4 guys with a dream of finishing this monsterous burrito.Manuels is located off of green leaf...in the middle of no where.Kinda like a dont blink or you will miss it.If you want to sit inside you better be wiling to wait because theres a line outside waiting to get in. As for the burrito,it was huge if your wondering about trying to eat it on your own...heres some advice dont even try it.If you do take some prilosec and take the day off of work.The burrito aka Manuels special feeds about 6-8 people.It cost around 28 dollars and you get alot for what you pay. The taste of the burrito was ok...wasnt OMG and it's something that i dont think i would crave anytime soon.I just wanted to try this massive burrito and say i somewhat ate it..you know just for the Kick the bucket list.

What a great place!  I live about 1 hour away and am already planning on my next visit to East L.A.  We ended up here at about 1:30 on a Tuesday afternoon; we had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes for a table.  The staff does a very good job of clearing the tables and getting you in the door.  Also, the wait staff was very attentive and personable. On to the food.  I wish I had taken pictures because my description will not do it justice.  We ordered a full order of guacamole (about $5), expecting a small dish that you would get at one of those chain restaurants.  Boy, were we shocked when the waitress brought a huge plate to our table mounded with freshly made guacamole and a big basket of crispy chips.  Everyone knows that the true test to a good Mexican restaurant is the quality of their chips and salsa.  El Tepeyac passes the test with flying colors! The hubby and brother both ordered Machaca - huge amounts of yummy beef, seasoned well, with plenty of tortillas, rice and beans.  I ordered the beef taquitos (2) and they were also good - plenty of meat inside.  I really liked them, but I crave the machaca and guacamole. A true treasure!

Warning **For the true mexican food enthusiasts only!** One very warm Sunday afternoon I find myself driving down Whitter Blvd in ELA with a car full of my cousins including my little munchkin, and I find myself flooded with memories of my teenage years. Landmarks of the hispanic culture I was once surrounded by in my youth that I learned to love and embrace. At that minute as the sun begin to set, we decided it was an El Tepeyaks kind of day.   This place is one of those places that no matter the success they never change their roots or their origin. So with that being said, yes you pull up to an original building, across the street from an old church, on a Sunday afternoon, smack in the middle of East Los Angeles, and you will find yourself waiting in line for a heaping serving of heaven. Once your in, anything on the menu will not displease. My all time favorite is a tie between the chicken tacos (loaded with all the trimmings) or the chicken fajitas cooked with jalepenos .... aye papi! I promise this place is worth the wait, and if you're there on a warm afternoon there's nothing wrong with grabbing a table in the patio! p.s. bring your own wipeys for sooooo many reasons I won't publish here publicly ;-)

Authentic, historic, and deliciously large portions! The location is amongst residences, across the street from a church. It looks like this was a home that has since evolved into a restaurant. The seating is cramped with some bar stool seating and a few tables scattered around an older jukebox. The kitchen sits between a walk up window for to go orders and the dining section. If you go to dine expect to wait. With plenty of family photos this places gives you a homey feeling. The food is excellent. I would not say it's the best Mexican cuisine I have ever tasted but it's very fresh and comes in large portions. Every menu item is delicious so you can try anything with confidence. If you have a party you can share their famous Manuel's Special or go it alone and earn yourself a t-shirt if you finish. The red salsa is particularly addicting with a unique heat that will keep your mouth watering for more. The chorizo breakfast burrito is hands down the best I have ever had. With your usual selection of coffee, juices, and Pepsi branded soft drinks they also offer horchata. The service is exceptionally friendly and the food is prepared in a timely manner, even when very busy. They have accommodated large orders on game day with ease. Overall this place is a must try if you are an Angelino.

Ever see a 4 lb burrito? Well if you have, I bet you haven't seen many. El Tepeyac is the home to the "Manuels Special". This 4lb colossus is packed with the meat of your choice beans rice cheese wrapped in a warm tortilla. Many people have taken up on eating this whole burrito in one sitting and have failed miserably as well as succeed. The Manuel Special has been displayed on tv on the entertaining show Man vs. Food. If Los Angeles was a person, he/she would be proud to give birth to world famous Mexican Resturant El Tepeyac.

So you think you like burritos...well, you gotta try this place.   My fam loves the Hollenbeck aka the GINORMOUS burrito that can't even fit on a plate...they need a slab of cardboard to carry that thing.  I am personally a fan of the guacamole & taquitos, but will partake in the gluttony when this burrito is around.  I swear it can feed a family of 5 with no problem.  If you attempt to eat it by yourself you will have problems.  That being said, the meat in the burrito is a little tough and only eat this if you like spicy foods.   So if you go, plan on a long wait.  Luckily, my Grandma still lives down the street so when we are craving to add a few pounds, we call in our order to go and bypass the line.

You can't eat here a lot because they cook everything in lard apparently. That's probably why it tastes so good. Well I guess you could eat here a lot, but it wouldn't be good for your arteries. I ordered the carne asada tostada cuz I wanted something smaller. I still couldnt finish it. It was decent but I've had better meat. My co-worker ordered the machaca quesadilla, and damn that was goooood. It was cheesy, meaty (and oily) goodness. I am ordering machaca when I go back. The burritos are as large as advertised and I was appalled when I saw a woman order the Manuel special for herself. I thought it was for the table of 4 she was at, but everyone else got their own dish. Talk about artery clogging! I couldn't watch her eat it. Minus one star because they made a mistake and brought out a carne asada quesadilla instead of machaca, and then charged us for an extra horchata...and the lady didn't know how to remove it from the bill and we had to wait 10 minutes before she gave us money for the horchata, instead of taking it off the bill.

Well what more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said..... I'm so tired of Mexican food man! I am. But here the food is very good. For you white folks, this is as close as authentic as your going to get. All dishes are great but I recommend you try the famous HOLLENBECK. It is a giant burrito with tons of tasty ingredients. I don't know of anyone who can finish it all.   REMEMBER: you can take it home.... I have white friends that take a few to go and freeze them for later or parties. Manny is the Owner and he is a cool old man. I've known him for decades and he is always in good spirits. If you see him in the morning tell him "George said you'd give me a shot for the hang over"... He will bring out the bottle of tequila or presidente... But you better drink it! Great place to visit.

We got here at 10am on a Saturday morning and there was already a line to dine inside. Thankfully we noticed that there was a separate, over-the-counter service for those who didn't mind outside tables. Anyways, my sister and I ordered a steak burrito with the idea of sharing it. When we got our order I was flabbergasted. MY STEAK BURRITO WAS THE SIZE OF MY EFFIN' HEAD. Once I got over that initial shock and dug into my food, I wasn't too impressed. Maybe I'm just unaware of genuine Mexican cuisine, but I don't really like gloppy burritos with tough, dry meat. However, their horchata was great!

Not that size matters... but you will have leftovers for days.   The boyfriend and I headed out there for one last "gonna start the diet again on monday" hurrah this past weekend.  We arrived around 10pm and there was a line of about 15 people out the door. wow.  We waited about 15 minutes and took advantage of 2 open counter seats.  Ordered some chips and salsa.. mmmm..  I got the veggie burrito, he got some meat one, chicken or pork I forget.  DELICIOUS.  I think I ate about 1/4th of it and was STUFFED.  And there are numerous other things on the menu I would love to try in the future.  (after I reach goal weight that is.. could be a few months.. grrrr) I WILL BE BACK

Alright alright, I already know this is going to be perceived as blasphemous (Although "I've experienced better" isn't really that damning) by most and I'm a little ashamed to do it because I hate that people have been ripping them off and its a shame that other places are doing so (it is a landmark without question). BUT, with that said.. I had the 'carne asada'/steak burrito, it was unquestionably mediocre by SoCal standards. The style of beef they use is definitely not my cup of tea. They use cubes of stewed beef, not the 'normal' carne asada style at most Mexican restaurants. I've lived in SoCal my entire life and this flavor and quality does not measure up to what I'm used to. Now, I know there are obviously people here who are fans of this 'style' if you will, but all 3 of my friends were in agreement that there was absolutely no reason we would ever go back. It's not that the food tastes bad per say, but it's just unique and not in a good way IMO. I would equate it to someone's home cooking wherein you realize your grandma does it better (so, totally subjective). The BIG burrito is really impressive though, obscenely huge (albeit $25). My buddy finished all but 3 inches of it (he's 6'6). Its like eating a small dog in terms of proportion and the regular burritos are already too much for most. Again, my friends and I only had the steak so maybe my review is skewed slightly.. but honestly, that's the bench mark I measure all Mexican restaurants by anyway so don't be surprised if you're let down too. I warned you. *Puts on flame retardant suit*

So, yes, the burritos are HUGE (ridiculously huge. Monstrously huge. Unfairly huge.) and delicious.  I would not wait in line for this place, though. Also?  Do NOT come with a group larger than four.  It's not worth the time and effort and the place is TINY and not really designed to accommodate groups.  If I had known how tiny this place is before-hand I would have either declined to go or insisted we sit on the patio outside.  The wait staff makes sure you know that your group is an inconvenience.   But if you are hungry (more realistically: starving) on a Saturday afternoon and you and, at most, three friends want to give this place a shot, it definitely won't disappoint.

My bf who grew up in the hood took me here, insisting that this was the best place to get a wet burrito. He was right! The first time here, I ordered a chicken burrito and could only finish half way. The bf managed to eat his entire carne asada burrito, but he definitely had a food coma afterwards. I can't even imagine what it'd be like to chow down that famous Manuel's Special! I saw a couple digging into that thing the other day and it was jaw-dropping enormous. Scary! Would love to try it though, some day with a group of friends. I can now understand what all the hype is about. Prepare for a long wait on a weekend, this place was packed, even around 10pm. There are outdoor seatings on the side, if you don't bother to wait. The last time I came here, I tried the beef enchilada and chicken taco combo. I was expecting a soft taco but they only had hard ones. Boo. Beef enchilada was tasty though. I'd say just stick with the wet burrito afterall.

Went today for the first time... it was GOOOOD! The service was good to everyone else except to my friend and I! I don't know why. I wasn't rude or being an asshole, we spent our time there being ignored by the waitress most of the time. Had to wait more than 30 min just to get the bill but meh... Anyway, had the Manuel's Special w/ carne asada and it was GREAT. I should have gotten it without the salsa though, I hate soggy burritos. The carne asada wasnt anyhting special, but the beans/rice in the burrito were good. Will definitely come back and try out the rest of the menu.

After begging me for over a year, I finally obliged my husband and let him take us to El Tepeyac Cafe for dinner last weekend.  I wasn't stoked about the neighborhood from the get go, and it was not any better than I imagined. This restaurant does a major business!!  The tables were full the whole time we were there and there was a line outside waiting to get in.  Once we finally made it inside, I felt totally cramped.  They have tables back to back and it's claustrophobic. Now on to the food... my first impression was that they don't give you chips and salsa while you wait!!  Alas, I ordered a combination with a taco and enchilada.  My plate was messy looking and I really didn't know where to begin.  The taco and enchilada were good...the beans and rice were bland.  But man do they give you a ton of beans and rice!! My husband ordered the Hollenbeck burrito and he enjoyed it well enough, but he felt the chile verde lacked verde.   After seeing all of the great reviews we may give them another shot.  I think I need to skip anything with rice and beans and have a taco and taquito ala carte because the meat was really good.   Service was friendly but very slow and the prices were reasonable.

I came here earlier this year. I thought the food was ok. There is much better Mexican food to be had at a number of places in Los Angeles. I still don't understand what the big deal is with this place. The day that I came there was a line to get in. I ended up sitting at the counter. This place is very small. I believe I had the Taco plate. The food was fine but I wouldn't say it is great or the best Mexican food I ever had. My moms tacos are better then the ones served here. I think this place is highly overrated. This is one of those LA places that everyone need to try once so they can judge for themselves. Personally I didn't think it was anything special.

OK....so I know not a lot of people agree with how good this place is.  But I love and miss going here.  I work in a hospital near the neighborhood. And maybe it tastes wonderful to me since I was introduced by the people who grew up in the same area and love this local spot.  I guess it's almost like watching a movie.  Some might get the humor and some just find it cheesy, so if you're watching it with the wrong person, you might end up seeing it the way they did cuz they'll keep commenting of how bad the movie is.  Everyone who comes to this local spot, grew up in the neighborhood.  It's almost like a sense of tradition. My favorite is their signature "Manny Special".  But I always buy the chicken since I don't like pork.  If it's your first time trying their burritos, it's a bit on the wet side since they serve it big and the meats are soaking in it's juices.  It's prepared differently! Of course!  isn't that what you expect from any other restaurants you go to?  Still....I miss this place. And watching Man Vs. Food made me want to re-visit and order the enormous Manny Special that serves 3-5 people.  Or you can get the bigger size for a party that serves up to 15 people.  You may love it or end up hating it.  But it's definitely worth trying.

a group of us waited outside in the freezing cold (judge however you will, i dont care if it was only 50 degrees out. It froze my nipples)  in the beginning of january. El Tepeyac was packed with people, it was at least a good 20 minute wait. A man stood outside, in line with us and asked how long the wait was. We told him 20 minutes. He said it was worth it. he wasnt kidding. We just wanted some delicious mexican food. AND WE GOT DELICIOUS MEXICAN FOOD. amongst the 6 of us, we shared the bigger manuel special. it was served on a aluminum party tray. it was glorious. bigger than my arm. The burrito was filled to pulsating-proportions of chile verde. It was then TOPPED with more chile verde. It came out in like 10 minutes. Goodness, the cooks are quick. The waitresses were just the friendliest people ever. They made sure we were happy and our cups were filled with water. really, what more could we have asked for? There's no doubt we're coming back. Can i take down a manuel special by myself? we'll see. But food challenges aside, this place is a go-to staple for anyone in LA. Hell, it's gotta be on everyone's bucket list.

I have been coming here since i was a kid and every time it is soo good. Prices are a little expensive; more than you would expect for a mexican food cafe, but you get your dollars worth in food. This is one of the only places where they are not stingy on the guacamole. Gotta get the hollenbeck or okie burrito. So friggin good!!! The cafe is tiny so if you can manage to get a spot to eat that awesome. If not, they have the to-go window on the side which is convenient.  Expect to wait in line.

Been here once to try the Manuel's Special Carne Asada Burrito. The price was $20 at the to go menu and $30 if you dined in. I took it to go and was fairly surprised in the variety of ingredients included in the burrito including the massive amount of home made guacamole. This was not the best burrito that I have ever had and by far the worst. I was just expecting larger slices of asada, charred and perhaps marinated a differently. For $20 this meal sure provided a better value than ordering 4x $5 at just about anywhere else. This burrito included 7-8 salsa containers, red and green. Personally I preferred and enjoyed the green as it had flavor and heat. The red was heat only. FYI the neighborhood might feel a bit sketchy to those unfamiliar, lost and traveling at night :P

This place is the bomb. It is a tiny place and on any given day there is a line up the street. (it's worth the wait) The hollenbeck burrito is my go to choice here and I would recommend it to anyone. The meat is so tender and flavorful. One bite and you will be a fan too. Come hungry as they are large. There is an order window on the side of the building if you don't feel like waiting in line. Also a few tables out there as well, though they do fill up quickly. I have nothing to criticize about this place at all except I wish there were more of them around. Hats off to you Manual. keep up the good work and more importantly..........the great food.

I only came here because I saw it on Man vs. Food and although it was a worthwhile experience, because I was starving, it wasn't the best mexican food i've tasted. Kinda salty and oversized.

When I was a medical student at USC, I probably ate at El Tepeyac once a week.  One time, I downed an entire Hollenbeck burrito right before I had to jump onto the elevator at University Hospital.  Oh boy, I think all the blood was in my stomach digesting that burrito goodness and the quick upwards ascent in the elevator pulled the remaining blood from my brain.  I almost blacked out!!!   I can honestly say though that I've never eaten inside the restaurant.  We always went to the side window and got our orders to go.  Gotta love those crunchy tacos and the thigh sized burritos.  Definitely worth a special trip just to experience those flavors again.

I've been to El Tepeyac about a dozen times. The first time I visited, I sat at the counter and ordered the chili verde plate. What came out was a good-sized portion of chili verde, arroz y frijoles. I was surprised though that the chili verde was red in color. It was good and I left stuffed. Since than, I've had their chicken taquitos with lots of guacamole on top and hard-shell beef tacos stuffed with lots of shredded cheddar cheese. I've never ordered their burritos. The portions are generous, but that's because you're paying for it. When you pay around $3 for a hard-shell taco, it better be stuffed. Oh and I can't stand El Tepeyac's red and green salsas. They just taste nasty to me. After the first few times waiting to get crammed inside to eat, I now choose to order at the takeout window and dine on the right side of the building. I've made the mistake of visiting on Tuesday when they are closed, so I head down the street to Ciro's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…).

I have read about this place for years. Seeing it on Man v. Food convinced me that I had to make the drive to try a Hollenbeck for myself. After having a couple days between me and the experience I feel like I can write a review that is honest and not fueled by shocking disappointment. I dragged two friends along for the adventure. After the three of us sat and ate our Hollenbecks I felt compelled to pay for their meal. I guess I thought of it as reparations for making them drive an hour out of our way for such an unmemorable meal. Maybe I expected too much? This burrito seemed perfect on paper and through a Panasonic plasma filter. It simply does not live up to the hype. I loved Manuel and the free shot of tequila. I loved the local neighborhood vibe. I loved our friendly little waitress. I loved the description of the Hollenbeck at the top of the first page of the menu. Unfortunately, I did not love the Hollenbeck. I love spicy food, but I am perfectly capable of enjoying a meal without spice. The Hollenbeck's problems didn't simply stem from a lack of spice. It's problems were rooted in a total lack of flavor what-so-ever. Did I go on a bad day? Was it just one bad batch of chile verde? Does this stuff always just taste like hunks of tough deep fried pork stewed in water for thirty minutes? I mean, seriously, is this really what all the hype is about? Do people really just love bland food in mass quantities? I wanted to love this place so much. It actually kind of pisses me off that it was so blah. I am sure I will give it another shot at some point. I will have to order something completely different, like enchiladas, and then I can decide if El Tepeyac is a lost cause

I remember coming here as a kid and in high school. It was where my friends and i would split a meal and talk endlessly about high school issues (HA!). I believe the 251 or 252 drops you off right in front or something like that. perhaps because my mom is such a good cook or because most food is pork based(ewl), it was always a hit or miss for me. They have really big burritos (that's what she said!) dry or swimming in some sort of sauce  and that is what they are famous for. I do have to say that i am a sucker for guac. Total sucker. And let me tell you that El Tepeyac has the best around, maybe that is why i kept going back because i would even buy some to take home. avocados=god's gift to mankind. OHHH never ever show up for lunch during the week because you'll never be seated since all the businesses flock there for lunch meetings or just to lunch.

Giant portions are only a blessing if the food is something you actually enjoy eating. How a restaurant managed to make a cheese fiend like me complain that there was simply too much cheese in the cheese enchiladas is beyond me -- but it happened. The chips were good, but the salsa was so smokey I thought maybe I'd accidentally been dipping into an ash tray. The service was personable, friendly, and quick -- reason enough to return, but the painfully large portions of Blehxican food I can do without.

From what I've read from the previous reviews, the food is pretty much the same and above average.  I used to come here while I was attending Cal State L.A.   Their machaca burritos are tasty and their taco de carnitas are deliciosa!  The neighborhood is in a barrio; so beware at night.     Update:  they were recently cited back in August 19, 2009 for vermin infestation and harborage, according to the Health Department of Los Angeles.  For that, I am going to remove two stars!

I just opened up all my reviews for other Mexican restaurants and dropped them by one star. I split a Hollenbeck, two other burritos, and an order of taquitos, and I can't get over how good the meats are.  Tender, delicious, and fresh.  Guacamole made from scratch, fresh vegetables, generous portions, and a lot of attention to flavors.  It's everything you could want in Mexican food. The other reviews commenting on the cleanliness aren't an exaggeration, but it doesn't bother me.

The BF and I came here and shared Manuel's burrito. The thing is HUGE. However, the carne asada inside was lukewarm and really just... tough. Bad quality meat maybe? Anyhow, we were very unimpressed with the food. I may go back to try something else another time, but not anytime soon.

The place is tiny with a lot of history.   With that said, the portion sizes are huge and good compared to Americanized Mexican food.  But if you eat Mexican food and know where to get it, you know this place is not really better than any typically authentic Mexican place so temper your expectations. I guess the 6 lb burrito creates the hype.  Overall the place serves decent food, but isn't good enough to make it a destination stop.

I've been coming here since I was a little girl growing up in Boyle Heights.... 20 something years later I'm still a fan and always make my way back home to El Tepeyac! As soon as you walk in you get that welcome home feeling! Eating here is like going to your Tia's on a Sunday afternoon. Manny is still walking around flirting with the ladies and serving tequila shots! Expect to be called "mijo or mija" by the waitress. You'll definitely get your moneys worth (you'll have the leftovers to prove it.) I usually order a bean, cheese, and rice burrito (with all the fixins) and don't even come close to finishing half!

Manuel's special, thats all I gotta say. That is the best and tastiest burrito ever, delicious and for a great price!. People who have eaten these before will crave them for years to come lol. Im actually craving one right now! So my fiance went to go pick one up (we now live 40 minutes away so dont get them as often).  Also if you are a meat eater order them with extra meat (oh also it taste better with Machaca? not sure if thats spelled right, but its not the shredded beef).

I ate at Manuel's today for the first time in years...it's almost as charming as I remember. The service is affected greatly by the size of the dining area and how busy they are. Also, they charge for chips and salsa- serperately!!! Considering where they're located, that should be a crime! I had the nachos. They were delicious- layered perfectly, not a dry chip on the plate! Though, the chile verde was a bit dry. Next time I might opt for the chicken instead. Also, they have a famous local challenge. The Hollenbeck special burrito. If you can finish the family size (serves 2-4) in 1 hr, it's free, you get your photo on their hall of fame and a cool t-shirt!

There was a wait to get in the restaurant, which many have detailed, but it was all a part of the experience. Each person in line had their own story- how they found the restaurant, whether it was their first time, and what they were wanting to try. The waiters and waitresses were all so friendly. I sat at the bar with a friend, and we enjoyed the hollenbeck burrito, as well as the cheese enchiladas. My friend raved about how great the enchiladas were, especially since they had real cheese. My friend liked the rice too in that it had a very authentic taste to it. The hollenbeck was great. Who else tops a burrito with meat (and sauce)?

So I love the whole East Los culture, so I had to come here to try one of their huge ass famous burritos. 25 bux and it feed "2-4" people. More like 4-6! It was huge! Yes the Manuels Special carne asada wet burrito was good, but!...I prefer King Tacos wet burrito in the Maywood location. The meat just didn't taste like asada, it just tasted like regular meat.

This place won me over with their gargantuan portions & excellent service.   They gave our group 4 double tequila shots on the house during lunch, who does that ?  The burritos are the size of a small house cat, & they must own their own avocado orchard cause they don't skimp on the guacamole.  The food probably won't blow your mind, but it is better than average, be prepared to wait in a line if you want to dine inside-

Man vs Food and Food won and will always win at Manuel's.  I've had Manuel's bookmarked for a while after seeing the Manuel's Special on Man vs Food.  It's a Chile Verde Burrito that weighs 5 lbs.  Now they do have a challenge where you get a t-shirt if you eat the whole thing.  But on the menu it does say for 2 to 4 people.  I'm guessing this is their version of a legal disclaimer.  I also noticed they have a shrine of Guadalupe out in the parking lot, just in case the Manuel's Special takes another customer to the great beyond. OK, so this Original Manuel's Special is 2 large flour tortillas filled with rice, refried beans, fresh guacamole, and lots of chunks of pork in a Chile Verde sauce.  It is then topped with shredded cheddar cheese and then more pork and Chile Verde.  The burrito itself stands about 18 inches long, 7 inches wide and 5 inches high.  Then add on a few more inches in each direction for extra toppings, and sidings, and bottomings.  This is not a lonely burrito, you could just eat everything around the burrito and be full.   The chunks of pork were deep fried ahead of time.  Not breaded or anything, just put into a fryer to crisp it up a bit.  I'm not a big fan of this, and it's the only reason I'm giving Manuel's 4 stars rather than 5.  Pork is such a succulent meat, but by deep frying it, it got dried out a little bit.  It still had a great flavor however because it had been sitting in their Chile Verde sauce for a while.  Since I'm a gringo, Verde is one of the 50 Spanish words that I do remember from Spanish class.  I can also say cat, dog, pen, and pencil.  Yo speako Mexican very well.  So I can officially say there is nothing Verde about their Verde.  It's actually Rojo (I will assume that something as manly as this burrito is masculine and go Rojo rather than Roja).  They use lots of tomatoes in the Chile Verde rather than tomatillos and thus turns it red.  But the flavor of those chiles is amazing.  Not as hot as you would think by any means, it's a very medium spicy Chile.  I love hot and spicy food, but lately I am really enjoying places that can pull out the flavor of a spicy food without all of the heat.  You don't get to taste those flavors that often, because the heat covers it up.  I also really enjoyed the guacamole inside the burrito. It's very chunky and the big pieces of avocado don't get lost at with all the other bold flavors.  At some places the rice and refried beans are just fillers, but not here.  Each was top quality and very flavorful.  It's some of the best rice and refried beans I've had. So how did I do....I finished about 40% of it.  My wife ate about 25% of it.  The remaining 35% is taking up an entire large styrofoam container in my fridge.   I've been snacking on it as leftovers and it's holding up very well the next day.  The flavors may even be better today as they've had even more time to mesh together.  It's the burrito that just keeps on giving as I'm sure I can get today's lunch and dinner out of this thing.

Shredded beef taco was OK, nothing special. Carne asada burrito was filled mostly with rice, the carne asada was bland and in short supply. Toward the end of the burrito I found chunks of avocado, but it would have been nice to have it throughout the rest as it was pretty dry. Not sure if I was just there on an off day, but I won't try here again. Service at side window was prompt, polite and helpful. Very expensive, $28 for 2 burritos and a taco.

Of course, after seeing Man vs. Food, I'm pretty sure my entire reason for wanting to go to LA that weekend was for the Manuel Special burrito.  I thought it was great!  Chile was good, and the guac was really fresh. There was a line out the door, but it was just my husband and I, so we were able to jump ahead of the line to sit at the bar.  The waitstaff was nice, and we got out of there spending less than $20.  Can't go wrong!

I agree with the statement of "large portions, small flavor." Unfortunately, my memory of my friend's leftovers from this place, years ago, were better than the meal I had over the weekend. :'( It was cool that they let me put potatoes in my veggie burrito. But it was sad that their salsa wasn't very good. Also, their cheese enchiladas were too dense, so the cheese was hardly melted. But in the end, their guacamole dominated all.

I wish I lived closer so I can frequent it more often. Dining-in is usually a pain...because of its popularity...it can take a while to be seated.  Dining room is small...

We also saw this place on Man vs. Food. I love LA's hole in the wall places, like El Matador, Chano's, and the taco trucks in Eagle Rock, so we decided to check out the 'Yac. First, Many, the owner, meets you at the door. The staff is friendly. The place is small, so the long lines outside are misleading--there is seating for only about 35 people. There was plenty of seating at the counter, but it stinks because you watch the staff washing cups. It is loud inside. The restaurant has a "B" rating, which can be a deal breaker for some. The portions are huge and the food is priced accordingly, around $8.50 per burrito. I had a Hollenbeck burrito (chile verde [in RED sauce, mind you], rice, beans, guacamole, and more chile verde on top) and my brother had the Okie machaca (shredded beef) burrito. I ate the whole burrito for lunch and have not been hungry for 10 hours. The food was just ok, nothing special. The pork chunks in my burrito were inconsistent--some were succulent, others were tough & dry, as if they had been sitting around. The taste was normal, just like any other burrito. Remember, you pay for the big portions--other places have smaller portions but you pay $2-$3 less. I would probably not come back. It's one of those restaurants where you go back just because you forgot the food is nothing special. Give it a try, but don't expect a life-altering experience.

I first saw this place on the Man v. Food episode, so I knew I had to check it out.  First of all, let me say, this was a FANTASTIC experience. A long line out the door, but, it moved quickly.  My girlfriend and I sat at the counter, which was the best move, as we got excellent service, and were able to chat it up with the owner, Manuel.  Just like in the M v. F episode, Manuel was there at the door, greeting and talking with everyone, and cruising around the restaurant constantly. By the way, throughout the meal, Manuel kept feeding me drinks - so, make sure to befriend him!!! I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito - which was the 'smaller' version of what was featured in the Man v. Food episode.  The burrito was absolutely massive and delicious, and was definitely worth the trip out to Boyle Heights.  I most certainly will be going back.

OMG! I love Manuel's... for the uninitiated El Tepeyac is Manuel's if you are on North Evergreen in Los Angeles. Don't accept any lesser El Tepeyac. There is almost always a line to get in but I haven't had the wait be so long that it was not worth it. :-) Talk to the people in line and you will understand that you are in for a treat. I always find people from more that 20 miles away or greater! Often from other states! Manuel's is truly a destination for Mexican food lovers. I love the Machaca and always get it extra spicy, that means extra jalapenos. I always get it. I know that others swear by the other menu items but I just can't bring myself to not have Machaca! Yes it is that good. It is not a fancy place but who cares. The food is Awesome! Eat here!

My boyfriend and I went to El Tepeyac Cafe because we saw it on Man vs. Food. We went on a Saturday afternoon and we had to wait in a line. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes, we went in and sat down. The place is very small. So if you want a big party, I doubt they can accommodate you. We ordered the Manuel special chile verde burrito, the one that was on the show. It was a five pound burrito. I really don't like mexican food that much, though I am half mexican. It was really very big. It was very good. Of course, there was leftovers, but I will eat it again. If and when I go again, I plan to try the guacamole, it was very good, but it was inside the burrito, so I couldn't taste it as much. The place is in East Los Angeles, the parking was adequate, the horchata, which I NEVER like, was great!!! It was also very reasonably priced. I would recommend this place.

Don't even bother to chow down on this burrito with you hands, because it is too big to be held. It was my first experience where a burrito cannot be eaten without a fork and knife. The burrito was almost the size of my face and it wasn't even the Manuel Special. The portion was very large and heavy. We ordered Hollenbeck and Pollo Burrito. Hollenbeck was everyone's favorite choice. It was packed with pork, guacamole, beans and rice. Pollo burrito was good too and it looked like they threw in half of a chicken , with sautéed onions, and beans. Both burritos were so large that we had to to-go it home. Service was amazing and helpful. A waitress came to us few times if there were anything we needed. Lastly, she brought us a to-go box along with candies for us. I am definitely going back to this place with my other hungry comrades to finish the Manuel Burrito, which serves 4 to 5 people. Five stars for the portions, service, satisfaction, and creativity of serving the biggest burrito in southern California.

i am a fan. Key points... 1) very original and fun.... giant size portions. 2) flavor is good not great...With the huge size of the portions, food can cool down and mix together. 3) if you wanna awesome flavor, I would go somewhere, but if you want pretty good flavor and a original experience I would go here. Manuel's special is so big is feeds 4 people, but its so big, the flavors can get lost together. Taquitos are the size of corn dogs, definitely try those. Tasty tortilla chips and giant guacamole. Go check out this place for a fun and unique time and go to a taco truck for mexican food that you can feel in pores.

It's a pretty small place, but it seems like everyone gets in & out pretty quickly, so the wait isn't too bad. My boyfriend&I split the Manuel's Special burrito, chicken/pollo, and thank god we did. I saw a regular burrito, and that looked pretty big too, and this one was double+ it's size. We got chips & guacamole too, the guac is delicious! The service was really good too, we got our food like right away. We didn't finish the burrito and took 1/3 of it home + most of our chips. For the quantity+quality, the pricing is pretty good/cheap. Definitely a must-try place, but I would totally come again the next time i'm in la.

I have eaten here several times over  a course of 13 years.  Half of that time I did not have a choice, due to my family taking me. They think this place is amazing. My review: The only item I think is amazing are the shredded beef tacos, other then that I rather not eat here. I do not like the beans or rice and really anything else. I do not like the space you have to eat in, you cannot move in there. Oh the Menudo is decent.

El Tepeyac Cafe is not just a great place for food, it's a whole dining experience.  As the other reviewers stated, you will probably wait about 20 minutes to get inside.  However, that need not detract from your visit.  The friendly owner, Manuel, came out and was greeting guests.  We found that while in line you can order drinks and my friend even got a beer on the house. My husband, friend and I split a full order of guacamole with warm tortilla chips and a Manuel Special burrito with the Original Chili Verde (pork shoulder).  The three of us barely put a dent in the heaping plate of fresh guacamole and managed to finish nearly 3/4 of the DELICIOUS burrito.  All pork should taste that good!  When we asked to have our leftovers wrapped up, Manuel himself insisted on putting the remainder in a new tortilla, and we left with a burrito hefty enough to satisfy all of us for dinner that night as well!  Upon paying our check, each of us received a few pieces of candy to finish off the meal.  Our waitress told us that it was tradition. El Tepeyac Cafe (especially it's friendly owner) gives customers the feeling of sitting in the middle of a great family reunion...if your family makes the most amazing Mexican food ever.  You can't fake the kind of atmosphere, and for that alone I highly recommend that you visit.  Well, that and the chili verde.  Just trust me!

Pros: Their cool history Machaca burritos Big portions Chorizo, bean and cheese burritos! 1/2 orders of guacamole and chips are fresh and traditional Salsa roja is spicy and quite hot! Take-out window saves time! Cons: Long waits to eat inside. Hard to get much attention from the staff Pretty expensive! Shredded beef tacos aren't very juicy

Grew up coming here as a special treat.  Food has always been good.  The best part is the big portions!  Got to bring a friend and try the Manuel's Special, just to see a 5lb burrito!!   We went recently...  haven't been here in about 10 years.  We waited about an hour on a Sunday early afternoon.  Plus we had a big group of 7, we barely fit.   The food was good and lots of it.  The guac was fresh and over flowing!! We shared a bunch of food and I only spent $70 for seven of us!!!  The best part was the service, everyone was sooo friendly...  it was my wife's birthday and they played a birthday song on the Jukebox.  We spent a little longer than we probably should have considering the line outside.... but we were never rushed.  I left $30 for the tip and called it a great night!! Only thing my friend didn't like was they didn't serve alcohol, if you like that kind of thing.

What can I say, I've been coming to this place since I was a tiny little baby with my pop!!! My favorite dish here is the Kiko's Special! Two enchiladas de pollo (or your choice) served with beans and rice and topped with huevos!!!! Protein heaven! The parking sucks usually on the weekend, but Manuel is really good at kicking people out once they are done eating if there is a line outside of patrons waiting to get their grub on. My favorite part of visiting here, is the surprise tragito you get from Manny...be it tequila, brandy or some other type of liquor he's got on hand. Salud!

Roll up your sleeves, ready your stomachs, and prepare for glory. This place is the cat's pajamas. Lacking in aesthetics, but don't fret, the food and price make up for it in leaps and bounds. You may catch an occasional line out the door from time to time, but the wait isn't terribly long. (A little tip for you moguls on the go) If you don't have time to sit inside, there's a pick-up window just around the corner.   Pretty good Guac and EVERY burrito is exceptional. Wet, Dry, Hot, Mild. The sheer massiveness of these behemoths make chipotle burritos look like droopy eyed armless children... It's rumored that, "if you eat the Manuel's special outdoors, it would blot out the sun."   And for all you heat seekers out there, try the hot sauce. I love spicy and this stuff plucks my heart strings.     All and all, a staple of Los Angeles cuisine. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.    -Cheers

This place is awesome!!! Me and my friend came here after seeing it on Man Vs. Food! And WOW that Manuel's Special is huge!!! It is a treat to try something so big. The burrito is pretty good. We got the pork only to find out you can get it in chicken and beef (I think). There is so much flavor going on in this giant burrito. The only thing is the pork was kind of chewy (been in the pot a while I think) so next time we go, we are getting the chicken. Awesome place to go if you want to just chow down, the people there are cool. The food there is pretty dang good... just like how mama makes it ( i would imagine).

I visited this place yesterday for lunch with a co-worker. Unbeknown to us, yesterday was their anniversary so it was super busy! I am very finicky when it come to Mexican food but was pleasantly surprised. I had chicken enchiladas which were pretty good. The vibe in the place is nonpretentious and cozy but the place was a bit chaotic - every table was taken and there was a line waiting to get in. The owner  (an adorable little old man) ran around talking to as many patrons as possible. This is truly a little jem in LA and worth the trip. I will definitely be back!

I went here with two friends that can put away their fair share of large meals. We ordered the Manuel Special, a huge burrito filled with pork and topped with, you guessed it, more pork! Usually, with large portioned food, quality is sacrificed with quantity. Not at El Tepeyac. This was a delicious burrito that is worth the trip to East L.A. The parking lot has a corner shrine to the Virgin Mary and I guess it's there to pray for your soul if you tried to finish the Manuel Special by yourself. My two friends and I ate two thirds of the burrito and we were full. We took the other third home and it took two more people to finish it off. A $20 burrito that fed 5 people is an awesome deal. If you are in LA, you gotta give this place a try!

It's not completely authentic, but neither is it completely Tex-Mex. You would imagine a place that serves massive portions of food to stack up average ingredients, but not Manuel's Especial Burrito. The burrito is 5lbs of goodness. The burrito is so big that even an average family of four wouldn't finish the burrito in a sitting (we tried, but failed). We ordered the carnitas burrito (we didn't want to put in the extra cash for carne asada) and it was so delicious. What makes El Tepeyac more especial? Manuel Rojas! I would add a bonus 6th star because the owner greets you with a shot of tequila. He is a very sweet man, such a charmer too.

Save the carne asada and al pastor for your taco truck stops or backyard BBQ. This place has that hole-in-wall feel that any good Mexican restaurant has.  Good Mexican food shouldn't have that ultra-fresh taste and the place shouldn't look ultra-clean.  There should be an edge to the atmosphere and the area. The flavor, portions, and service are all excellent. Manuel's is East L.A. Mexican food at its best.

Indeed the portions are huge.  But the flavor is small.   Got the Hollenbeck burrito and I was gravely disappointed.  The meat was dry and flavorless, and the wet sauce that tops the burrito was a watery tomato sauce.  I found myself eating around the meat... and that's saying something from a carnivore like me.   The service was friendly, so I have to give them an extra star for that. Unless you're looking for huge portions to take photos of or bragging rights, I'd recommend you go elsewhere.

The only thing I was disappointed with at El Tepeyac was my own performance. I had my heart set on conquering Manuel's Special (Machaca), but came up pretty short. Other than that, no complaints. My mouth wanted more, but my stomach would not agree. My favorite part of the visit had to be Manuel himself. He's a true host. After a party of me and three other guy's were seated, he walks up to our table and explicitly states that "This is a man's restaurant, and here men drink Beer or Tequila. Which will you all have?" and so, we had a round of beers on the house. He then told us a story of his younger days, I couldn't fully understand what he was talking about because I was all euphoric over the massive amount of burrito I had consumed; But something about him being only 125 lbs. and was able to eat a 5 lb. burrito. Manuel is clearly a bigger man than I. So to sum things up: Good times, Good (and gigantic) burritos, and Free Beer. Well, I don't think it would be fair to give this place anything less than 5 stars.

DISAPPOINTED. saw man vs food. read the reviews. got hyped up and even dragged some friends. I thought the food was ok. apparently, everyone else thought it sucked. Burritos are MONSTROUS (they'd better be for 9 bucks) the 5 lb burrito took 4 people to finish. What they give in quantity, they definitely do NOT match in quality. Chunks of meat were decent, although everything tasted a little "off". I'm hoping it was just an off day for them. One friend describe the salsa as "ass-like" i've had plenty of better tasting mexican food. tepeyac is a notch above your average taco truck, but that's about it

THE HOLLENBECK --living one block away, I grew up inflating my gut on this burrito. Chunky pork chile verde counterpoints generous layers --of chunky guacamole, rice & refried beans --to easily fill any hombre hambre. COMPLAINT --my first Hollenbecks were tongue-stinging-hot --an acquired-taste rite of passage in East LA. But in recent years--the sauce has dipped into a chile-Recession. Some Yelpers said "Bland." Waitresses claim the jalapenos are not ripening as hot anymore. I say Manuel keeps the real chile on the grassy knoll. Recent visit--the carne was tough. MANUEL'S SPECIAL --bragging rights--I beat 2 Cal Poly amigos to devour my own 5-pounder --without camping in the head that night. But now--quiero this bad boy to feed four for 2 days.

This place is a very fun place. I recommend coming here if you want huge portions. That being said, if you want flavor, then you should go elsewhere. The biggest advantage this place has is the fact that its relatively cheap and very generous. If you are like me and do not eat that much, you should share a regular burrito with someone. If however, you are feeling very confident and do not have to drive back, then share the Manuel's Special with someone. The experience is worth it for the first time. I would only come back if I wanted to feast and/or had friends to feast with.

Been here for the first time yesterday. We ordered the Manuel Specials Burrito as we are 4 hungry people. The Manuel Special is the same as the Hollenbeck burrito. It's just the size that is different. If you grew up with the Asian food portions, I think The Manuel Special burrito is enough to feed 5 people. After tasting its burrito, I think the burrito was just okay. I could not find the "WOW" factor other than its size. For those who like Guacamole, Try it!! they have a very good Guacamole. They have their patio style next to their dining room (No Table Service - No Tip), so you don't have to wait for a long line. I would really recommend for you to try Tidal Wave in Sunset and Gower - Hollywood. Here is the yelp page http://www.yelp.com/biz/…  . Order their Burrito with Chorizo and Egg. It is a "WOW" burrito in my opinion. There are 2 Tidal Waves on the complex make sure that you go to the correct one.

Popular Mexican restaurant in Boyle Heights neighborhood.  We ate outside because of the long wait for a table inside.  They do have an ordering window and plenty of covered tables outside.  I had the Hollenbeck de Pollo burrito which was just under $10.  I opted for the red enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  You can get red or green chili sauce as well. The burrito was huge - about twice the size of regular burritos.  I asked for a to go container before I started eating it :)  The owner (Manuel) is well known in the neighborhood and is usually greeting people at the front door.

Large portions, well seasoned meat, friendly staff with quick service, and reasonably priced for the portion size. The burritos are ginormous.  I tried the "okie de" and "hollenbeck" burritos.  I prefer the okie de because the enchilada sauce added some sweetness to the burrito.  The guacamole is flavorful with the right consistency of creaminess and chunks of avocado.  The chips are crispy and perfectly dusted with salt. I came in and immediately found seating at the counter, but when i left (around 4pm on a Monday) a line of at least 10 people had formed.

This is probably the best Mexican food I ever had. I rarely eat Mexican food, and I'm not a big fan of it, but man the Manuel's special was pretty awesome. My first time having horchota and it was amazing. The only CON that I can think of is the price, and the drive to get there. Man is it expensive. $10 for a burrito is a bit much for me. However, screw the price, the taste is what matters. Me and my friend shared a Manuel's special with asada, and both of us felt like we just ate a buffet. Pretty good Mexican food I have to say, will go back if I get the chance.

Oh, El Tepeyac!  I came  here in the afternoon with about 12 people.  We had to split up into two tables because it was so busy, but that was fine.  The owner first came around offering us free shots of tequila and free beers.  We did partake in the shots around 1pm (don't judge, we had just played a gig and it seemed right at the time!).  Then we ordered some guacamole. Giant plates of guacamole were delivered to our table and it was delicious and flavorful.   Then it came time for the main event: The burritos!  I split a burrito with my friend and quite frankly, we could have split it with one more person.  Not only are they HUGE, but have perfectly cooked meat (or veggies) and beans on the inside.  There were a selection of about 10 different burritos.  Some were "dry" and some were "wet" with a variety of sauces to choose from.  All, I can say is you can't go wrong.  Then at the end, the owner came back offering us twinkies and ding-dongs which made for a comical end to the meal.

The burritos are wet inside.  The flagship burritos are huge and contain beef stew, rice, beans, etc. wrapped in a flour tortilla.  They don't cover the burritos in anything.  They're not 'wet burritos', which usually are slathered in cheese and red. If you like typical LA-style burritos (lots of refried beans and cheese), this will confuse or disappoint you. However, if you ignore the fact that it's called a burrito and think of it as a new way to eat beef stew, then you may be happy. Service was excellent and parking was ample (nighttime)

They're known for their massive Manuel Special Burrito which I witnessed but did not partake in. It looks like it could feed about 5 hungry people. There menu consists of your typical Mexican fare, burritos, taquitos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. A couple interesting things to note "Burritos can be made up to 6 feet long when ordered 24hrs. in advance deposit required for boards/refundable upon of board with receipt." They also have a special Lent menu that has items such as Taqullos De Papa (potato taquitos served with rice & beans) or Fajitas De Eamoron (shrimp with grilled onion, tomato, jalapeno & colored bell pepper served with rice, beans & tortillas). I ordered two tacos, one carne asada, which was your basic corn tortilla taco, and one pollo, which was deep fried. The carne asada was easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. The meat was beyond words, it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Piled high as can be, it really should have been two tacos. The onions and cilantro were the perfect accompaniments and just the right amount. The pollo on the otherhand was sub-par, the chicken was somewhat gamey, it was shredded and there was about 4 times the amount of cheese then needed to be. Had I not order this abomination I would have had a much much higher opinion of El Tepeyac. The chips were good and they served a green and a red salsa, both were good but nothing to write home about. I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.

My girlfriend's brother introduced me to this place. They said they had a 5 pound burrito they 5 people share and I decided to see how big this monster really was. The inside dining room was packed and there was a line outside, so we decided to eat outside. I ordered the Manual Special and it came out pretty pricey. Food was made quick and I was ready to tackle this monster. I ate 80% of it then got tired of eating because all it had left was beans. Very good food, kinda pricey, when you get the Manual special ask for a little beans because they pack it on. Very satisfied would come back again.

I went to Manny's once for Menudo...it was my first time...I was sitting at the bar cause the place was so full..after I started eating my menudo..and my friend the huevos Ranchereos (which are fantastic by the way)..Manny comes buy with a paper cup and some Jose Cuervo..he asks me.."Do you want some Tequila?" in the raspy voice of his...I am thinking...its 9:00 a.m. in the morning way too early...so i say no thanks...he says "There's some candy for you over there for you.." After that ALWAYS accept the Tequila..not my favorite for breakfast..but hey...this is the HEART of east L.A.!

My bf and I are fans of food shows, so we were excited to go to the same place Man vs. Food. We had read the reviews on Yelp and after much reading we decided to go when we weren't hungry and can be patient with the waiting, crowd and noise. It wasn't too bad!!! We got lucky and found parking right across the street. For a party of 5 we waited 30-40 mins in line. We had a great waitress who brought out our food and drinks quickly. She constantly checked on us and gave us excellent service. We ordered nachos and they we're awsome!!! So now we we're hyped about the burrito. My bothers are huge so they ordered 1 Manuel's special each, I split it with the bf. Talk about presentation!!! I was blown away on the size and weight of this thing, the taste was ok, not mind blowing like I hoped, my brothers and bf all agree. My brothers were able to finish half of it, we ate about a quarter of it. We took our left overs home and had some for dinner that night and for lunch the following day. So for a $25 burrito you get to eat 3 times for 2 people, not a bad deal at all. We would go back to show our friends and share the whole "world famous burrito in an a bad neighborhood" experience, but other than that we wouldn't go out of our way just because we crave a burrito.

This one is easy. It's the best to my knowledge. Nothing beats the taste, authenticity, environment, and history of this place. My dad came here as a grad student of ucla and now I go here as an undergrad. Perfect little homey small restaurant, always packed. The people working are cool too. Manuel's the man. I took my roomies here. And from my recommendation, we got 5 hollenbeck de machacas. No one was disappointed. I'm sure there are good things out there... but I haven't really ordered anything  but the Machaca!! Simple, if you haven't had it, go, now.

The food here is very good, this coming from a true Mexican-American who grew up in the San Fernando valley. It is not at the premier level of some of the drop dead delicious food of some hole in the walls in the SFV, but is well worth the 35min drive. The service is a bit dodgy sometimes though, the servers inside are very very good. Nice, pleasant and attentive, hell you even get to choose from a basket of candy after your meal. Now comes the rub, the exterior walk-up counter staff, hardly seem to care how long you wait and usually have a sarcastic attitude.

I tried this place out with my boyfriend because we both heard great things about it. We decided to eat outside as the inside had a wait and we were pretty hungry. Food: My boyfriend ordered the hollenbeck of course. I shared. It was BIG! But not that great...the sauce was pretty weak and did taste a bit watered down. The meat was a also a bit dry and some pieces had excessive fat on them. My boyfriend was satisfied. I wasn't. Service: Friendly. Our order came out fast. Overall impression: Probably won't be going back. There are a a lot of good reviews though so I would recommend you try it out for yourself...heck you might like it! But I've had better burritos closer to home and I think I'll stick with those.

So I heard about this place and how legendary it was and couldn't wait to try it.  My girlfriend, her sister, and I headed to east LA on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with great expectations.  The area surrounding El Tepeyac is a bit shady to say the least and I would not be caught there after dark, but the long line of people made me feel much more comfortable.     After waiting a good 45 minutes we got our seats.  The interior is fairly small and intimate.  A guy that looked like a day laborer went to the counter, spoke some spanish to the lady taking orders, and soon was rewarded by a tall plastic cup, filled with Jose Cuervo Gold.  I found this to be a bit strange to say the least; especially considering Cuervo Gold is about as bad as tequila gets, so I sat and stared with a mixture of marvel and disgust that someone would actually find pleasure in such an experience. The first thing to come was our guacamole.  I am a big fan of guacamole, but this stuff was very bland.  We added salt and pepper to try and make it more palatable, but I brushed it off in hopes of greater things.   I ordered their house special which is a massive chili verde burrito.  This burrito is giant; probably enough to feed three people.  It was okay; not great.  I wasn't dying to get my next bite in; like I do when eating really good mexican food.  I forget what the girls ordered, but it was also huge and bland.   Having been to a lot of Mexican restaurants throughout Southern California, I've got to say that this pretty mediocre.  It certainly isn't worth waiting in line, or going out of your way to get there.   My honest belief is that the reason people love this place so much is that their portions are huge.  If you are fat and or want to be fat, then this is your place.

If you haven't been to this place, GO GO GO! RIGHT NOW! It is Fan-freaking-tastic! Best burrito I've ever had... and I've spent a good deal of time in San Diego (the self-proclaimed burrito capital of the world). I haven't really tried any of their other food, but all I can do is rave about the Hollenbeck and Okie burritos. They're massive, cheap, and mouth-wateringly delicious. I've never been able to eat one by myself. I always split one with a friend. Seeing as these burritos cost about $8, it is easy for two people to eat for under $15. The guac is good too. Whenever we go, we have a 1/4 order... and it is enough to please a table of 4  easily. I LOVE the service at El Tepeyac as well. They're always super friendly, accommodating, and down-right fun to talk to. El Tepeyac is a MUST SEE/TASTE for out-of-towners who really want to taste the flavors of L.A. and SoCal. Heck, it should be and is a staple for locals... the place is always packed. If you haven't tried a Hollenbeck burrito, you're missing out!

We waited over an hour for a table, but we were told it was worth the wait. The food was good, it would have been better if we had ordered a couple of burritos and shared, the serving sizes are huge, the burritos are huge, everything was huge..except the place, very small, only a few tables and a counter. The service was quick, we had our food within 15 mins of ordering. It would be a good idea to order ahead of time and take out if you are from the area, there is a walk up order counter and tables outside to sit down to eat, that is a better idea than waiting for a table inside. A must do if you are in the LA area..

I first heard about this place on Man Vs. Food.  After going to The California Science center with my bf we decided to hit up El Tepeyac. There was a line outside when we got there. My bf's first words were "lets get it to go" I talked him in to staying because I wanted to get the full El Tepeyac/MvsF experience. lol It took us about 35-40 minutes to get inside. I ordered the Hollenbeck Asada burrito and my bf ordered the Hollenbeck De Chile Verde. $10 for a burrito? Whoa! Must  be a damn good burrito right?  Wrong!   We came up with a new name for this Restaurant. Drum Roll please..... [El TepeWACK] Ha! (sorry El Tepe- Lovers)   My asada burrito was not what I expected. I have one word for it....BLAND!!! My bf's burrito was No Bueno!  It had a ton of rice and beans and a small amount of meat which was also tasteless.  Also the server brought us chips. Man these chips must of been days old because they  were hard as hell. Meh! The wait and the price were not worth it.   I don't think i'll be back anytime soon...Well only if i'm in the mood for bland & boiled Asada. But hey don't let my review stop you. Check it out for yourself! Hopefully your experience is better than ours.       FYI: Tacos San Pedro in Hawaiian Gardens = Bomb!

It's obvious that the burritos here are exaggeratedly big, but lets not forget that they are jam packed with flavor. The first few times i went i took down the original sized burrito with ease. Then i tried facing the Manny's special, and ill admit it, i failed! that Ish looked like the trunk of a Sequoia Tree!! but damn was it bangin'.. My homie tried to take it down with some water, and got so full that it cost him the chance of getting laid that day. My dream is to one day have a picture on that wall.

Wow that was a big burrito, It was huge! but way too much rice in it. I am not a fan of rice in a burrito. There are alot of other things to try on the menu that are good. I know this because I tried everyone elses food. Its fun to order something you see on tv show. After taking pictures of this monster. I dug in, Its like a plate of food rolled into a burrito. Actually a couple plates of food. Overall the service was great and other peoples plates were better. I also had a great time sitting on my vacation and going somewhere with my family to experience something new. Try the Chile Rellenos. Try the tacos, they are all good. But for fun if you are with a bunch of people try the big burrito but tell them not to pack it with rice. Unless you like rice burritos.

Wanted to go here for over a year before I went.  To try their legendary burritos!  Tried to go a couple other times, but the line was too long to reckon with.  Finally we got lucky enough to get there when there was no line at all! Yay!  Almost as soon as I ordered and sat down, our burritos were brought out.  They must have a production line in back and get the tortilla out as soon as the word burrito crosses your lips.  Amazing, only thing is I wished the burrito's were hot.  The meat was warm, which made the whole thing kind of lukewarm.  But I like my food burning hot to start off with.  It was about the temperature I'd have expected when I was halfway through the thing.  But whatever, it was awesome to try my hand, with a partner of course, at a burrito the size of my torso.  Didn't even come close to finishing.  Yay, love me some yummy leftovers!!!  Plus then I could get those as hot as I wanted!  Would definately go again, and again, hopefully soon! Lol, have to share this, but the other day I noticed that the name sound's a lot like El Tip-N-Yack.... which is exactly what you feel like might happen after you attempt to stuff that much burrito into your stomach.

Great Food - Great Taste! This is not the place where you go get your typical carne asada, lengua, carnitas, etc. Burritos. You can go get those at your local roach coach... You come here to get a special kind of Burrito full of flavor and filled with all the ingredients that make it so. Where else do they stuff a burrito with tender pork pieces and over lay it with sauce and more chunks of meat...  By the way they dont hold back on the portion of food. I recommned the Hollenbeck Burrito!

The Pride of East Los Eateries! From Chorizo and Eggs in the morning before work to a Hamburger Steak with Grilled Onions for dinner.  El Tepeyac has much more to offer than just Burritos and Tacos- and never disappoints.  How they turn out all of that great food from that tiny kitchen with lightening quick speed is beyond me.  Keep up the good work Manuel, We Love You!

After catching this place on "Man vs. Food" we decided to try it out. Our conclusion: the regular size portions should be considered to be a challenge to finish alone... HUGE portions of quality mexican food. Tacos were large and in charge. And the carne asada burrito was so big me and my girlfriend couldn't finish it.

First saw this place on "Man v. Food" and the kids had been wanting to go there since. After a day long trip to Santa Monica we made the trek to east LA for dinner.  Had to wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Let me tell you it was worth it!  While in line we talked to a couple who had been going to El Tepeyac for years.  The wife grew up in the neighborhood and had been going there for over 30 years. It's a relatively tiny place, maybe 12 tables and about 6 stools at the counter. My daughter and I decided to try the Manuel's Special.  What a behemoth!  The two of us barely ate half of the five pound burrito.  Not only is it humongous but it was very good as well.  Quantity and quality, you can't ask for more!  My wife ordered a regular burrito and it was HUGE!  not as big as the Manuel's Special but must have weighed 2lbs.  My youngest daughter ordered a bean & cheese burrito and it covered the entire plate it was brought out on.  We took home a TON of leftovers.

I first went to this place a few years ago after hearing about their massive burritos.  I'm more used to "Mexican" food like Tito's Tacos, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I also have very particular tastes when it comes to my burritos.  One thing - NO AVOCADO!  There was just something about the texture that I didn't like. When you get to El Tepeyac, you notice that the menu doesn't really tell you what is in the burritos, but the cashier is more than happy to tell you (over and over again, in my case, since I have a short memory).  I ended up getting the Okie with chicken, which has beans, cheese, lettuce, and salsa (as far as I can remember).  I specifically asked for no guacamole. When the burrito arrived, it looked more like a pillow covered in red sauce.  I dove in, and was amazed at how awesome it was.  Then, I saw it.  Staring up at me was a giant piece of avocado.  I contemplated taking it back, but this burrito was so massive, I would have felt like I was wasting something that could have fed a family for a week.  So I ate it.  And it was awesome. Lesson - Any place that can make me eat avocado and like it deserves your patronage.

First off let me say the portion size on "manuel's challenge" is a b. Five pounds of burrito is no joke. Two full grown men on this thing and still can't finish it. Burrito was kind of bland, so you should get guac/salsa to help ease down all the cuts of pork you'll be scarfing down. The atmosphere is fun, and the service is very prompt and friendly.

I am so glad I only work 2 miles from El Tepeyac! My life changed today. I just had my first Machaca experience, as well as my first Manuel experience. We had to wait in line for about 20 mins, but to me that's the sign of a good restaurant. Manuel is a rad old guy who schooled my husband and I on how to age gracefully and stay active into your 80s. Apparently all it takes is about 25 shots of tequila every day. Sounds good to me! We both ordered the Machaca Tostada after we saw them pass our table. The Machaca is probably the best Mexican beef dish I have tasted yet. And it was HUGE. I am pregnant and hungry, but I could only get half of it down. I am already fantasizing about the other half... I forgot to mention, my husband and I had told Manuel we were expecting when we were in line. When we left and thanked him, he jumped up and yelled, "they're having a baby! They're having a baby!!" The whole restaurant cheered and clapped. It was pretty awesome.

The food is good, and it's a nice family atmosphere. A group of us finished off a Manuel Special Burrito, which is a feat that the average human should not try by himself or herself. The burrito itself was good but not great. It's kind of located in a place that's inconspicuous, but that's part of its charm, I suppose. There's nothing bad about this place. It just wasn't spectacular for me in any sort of way.

Definitely one of the best "hole in the wall" style places around. Portions are ridiculous and the found is unbelievably flavorful. I went with 3 of my friends and we ordered the biggest burrito they have which was approximately $32. Now the 4 of us are pretty big dudes and I must say we could not finish this thing. It was absolutely massive. The atmosphere is also very nice and friendly here. Definitely recommend this place to everyone.

I have been going to EL Tepeyac for some time now and the only thing i have tried is the machaca burrito. The reason being that i simply love this burrito. The taste never gets me bored or tired. 9 dollars for a burrito sounds expensive but imagine a burrito that barely fits in Chinese take out plate without the borders or slots or separators whatever they call them. The salsas for the burritos are green and red with unique tastes but both compliment the burrito very well. This place IS kid friendly and adult friendly as well ( being that the owner himself gives shots of tequila to those who look old enough and candy those who dont). If you go during peek lunch hours or weekends be prepared to wait inline for at least 30 mins not including the search for a parking spot.

This is my favorite restaurant. The Hollenbeck, as has been mentioned, is nothing less than mythical. What makes this restaurant great is the attention to detail. With the Hollenbeck, you not only get tender, delicious pork, but rice and beans of a quality that rival those of the best home cooks, tasty guacamole flavored by fresh avocado and cilantro, and, the huge portions for which this restaurant is famous. I highly recommend adding cheese-they use fresh cheddar grated in such a way that it melts perfectly over the burrito and under the chile verde. Other gems on the menu are the machaca and chorizo burritos, the Hollenbeck de asada and Hollenbeck de pollo, and the tacos. I very highly recommend this restaurant not only for its food but for the atmosphere, exceedingly friendly and expedient service, and the fact that it is a true staple of Los Angeles dining. Anyone who knows of a better Mexican restaurant, please let me know as I'd love to try it. Best wishes and God bless.

After eating at Manuel's for over 15 years, I am sad to say that I most likely will not be returning. Over the past few years, I have been gradually getting annoyed with the exponentially rising prices; but since I still craved their addictive huevos rancheros, once in a while I would break down and eat there. However, over the past year I've noticed that the flavors just aren't the same any longer. Last Saturday, during Memorial Day weekend, I took my in-laws there, and we all agreed that the food just didn't taste the same as we remembered it, and it no longer warranted the absurdly high price of $8.50 for eggs with salsa on top. The machaca was flavorless and bland, and they even forgot my husband's order. I think many other long-time customers agree with me because I've been there twice in the past four months, and both times there was no line on a Saturday! Usually there would be a line out the door every weekend, but such is not the case any longer. I gave the place an extra star for nostalgia, since Manuel's is an institution, but honestly, I'd rather frequent the million other LA Mexican restaurants that serve huevos rancheros for half the price, or my husband can just make it at home. I'm sad to see an institution like Manuel's go down like this, and maybe I will still be back once in a great while for old-time's sake, however, I'm sorry to admit that it just isn't the same any more.

Everything on the menu is MASSIVE! I'd suggest to share any plate with someone in your party. We first started with the 1/2 guacamole with chips for the four of us. I shared the Hollenbeck de Asada burrito, minus beans, and also the small size of menudo. The guac was legit. It was straight up barely but good enough mashed avocados with minimum amount of tomatoes. For me, it definitely lacked flavor. It was just the strong avocado taste, I like a little lime and salt in my guac, so it was average for me. I know some people who love guac the way its made here then it is most definitely off the hook. You won't find a place with generous amounts of avocados like that in your guac. The burrito was huge. It is the size of my fore arm. Dear Lord, it was a lot to take in. There was a sauce over the burrito, with some asada on the side, with cooked veggies (onions and tomatoes). Taking the first bit of the burrito, it was mediocre. The flavors were good but nothing that screamed amazing. Most of the burrito was just rice, had really less meat. I felt like I ate a whole bucket of rice. I wish there was more meat and some salsa in the burrito. I tried the menudo. It was good. My first time trying it and there were all kinds of crazy chunks of I don't know what exactly. The flavor was the hominy flavor, rich corn tasting. I liked that they gave you a plate of onions, cilantro, and lemons to add to the bowl. It was alright, I didn't know what it would taste like and now I finally tried it. I wanted it to be more sour though. Next time, lime and more of it. We also ordered Horchata. It was YUMMY! I love horchata but this one was exceptionally tasty. No refills. You have to savor every bit of it. Overall, it was a good experience but like I said, it was not amazing. There is always a first for everything. I feel like here is about the quantity rather than quality of food. They need to specify or describe a little more on the menu of the sauces they put on the burrito. If its spicy but a little chili pepper next to it or something. -Well, Give it a try. Judge for yourself. P.S. Wait outside the door if there is no seating. They don't take numbers or names, you just wait by the door and they just take whoever is next in line.

After hearing great things through word of mouth and a TV appearance on the Travel Channel- I was VERY disappointed. I ordered the nachos with chili verde pork.... :( pork was awful, dry and it was jerky. The agua de jaimaca was AWFUL!!!! It tasted nothing like jaimaca and more like nasty sugar water. The beef in the enchiladas was very questionable.... I was very, very disappointed as it is suppose to be a holy grail of great food. Has been there for years--- but the food and aguas frescas were grotesque... This was my first time and unfortunately my last time.  Nothing stood out...  at all... Not worth the wait.

I've only eaten here once but I had a great time.  You might have to wait a bit but it's worth it.  There's also take out window on the side of the place, so that's cool.  What's cooler?  Is that Manuel is there and he takes shots with you.  Oh man what is cooler than that.  I came here with some sexy ladies and we shared one of those gigantic burritos.  It wasn't the best when it comes to flavor but it was good and not really expensive.  The horchata here is solid too.  It's by no means the best tasting mexican food but it is a fun place to visit.

*****Disclaimer, although the following review is just that -- a review --  please be aware that it also contains a significant amount of hostile ranting and raving.  Reader's discretion is advised.  Thank you ***** Whoa Nelly!!!  I'm not the biggest fan of this place, but reading Nik d.'s review geared me into the defensive.  Comparing El Tepeyac to Baja Fresh and Chipotle is the dumbest thing I've ever heard...for MANY reasons.  First off, I freaking LOVE Baja Fresh, and I eat the ghetto food in the "barrio" with the rest of my cholas on a regular basis.  I've had "real" Mexican food from "real" Mexican restaurants and in the kitchens and backyards of "real" Mexican people.  I think it's insulting and naive to label the fans of El Tepeyac as incapable of recognizing the difference between a hole in the wall and an American chain.  Puh-lease.  How self righteous can one reviewer get? El Tepeyac IS a hole in the wall.  It is run by a man from Mexico, not an American from Mc Donald's who decided to go undercover with a fake authentic eatery.  The place has been open for 50 years, for Pete's sake!  It didn't spring up overnight!  I didn't even know about this place until my MEXICAN friends raved about it and dragged me over.  The food is NOTHING like Baja Fresh or Chipotle.  If it was, I'd immediately love it.  Yet, I'd also realize it would be from an American-like Baja region with a corresponding style.  This is not the case at El Tepeyac. Now, for my review. The wait was long.  Loooooong.  From what I gather, it wasn't as long as normal, which scares me, but then again I wait half an hour for freaking frozen yogurt at Pinkberry, so who am I to judge?  The only difference is, I'm not exactly "hungry" when I go to Pinkberry, so I can manage my irritation more easily.   I ordered the wrong thing.  I got some Oklahoma burrito that was filled with chicken and not much else.  When I read other reviews describing guacamole and onions, etc., I feel like going back and trying another burrito.  In fact, maybe I will.   My three stars is based on my poor choice of ordering and the fact that you have to pay extra for chips and salsa.  That's lame.  That should come standard.  I think this stems from their popularity and their sudden boom of success and media recognition.  If they can charge for chips, then let them charge for chips.  Not everyone can do that.  It just makes me pause and flick off a star (cuz I likey me chipsies). People love this place.  People of all ethnicities.  I'm going to go back to try something else.  Maybe I got it wrong the first time.  I prefer the super burrito at Taqueria Jalisco in Bell/Maywood.  However, "if you can discern the difference between american chains and mexcian" (Nik d.) I won't say "don't waste your time."  I say try it out, you might like it.  You'll realize it's not an American chain, but a Mexican restaurant.  Just realize you might not like it, because NOT ALL AUTHENTIC HOLE IN THE WALL MEXICAN RESTAURANTS SERVE THE SAME TYPE OF FOOD!!!  If all authentic hole in the wall Mexican restaurants served the same food and had the same standards and were 100% consistent, then that would symbolize a chain.  Maybe they should join together and come up with an authentic Mexican food experience Constitution that all should follow, as well as a blueprint for the design of all their hole in the wall establishments.  This way, all us idiots out there could recognize the difference. Or maybe not. Realize that I am a Chinese-Swedish-Scottish-German gal working in the barrio with an authentic Mexican boyfriend and an authentic Chinese mother who occasionally likes her Panda Express.  If this denies me credibility, go read another review.

Awesome that I saw man vs food a couple days before going to LA for my cruise to Cabo and Puerto Vallarta.  It was just as the show. Long line with Manuel out front greeting everyone.  He even offered us tequila when we got inside.  The chile verde burrito was done to perfection with meat shredding apart!  My wife and friends also enjoyed their burritos. Us guys worked hard to finish, but the girls just ate half.  This place is the whole enchilada...with salsa on the side!!

Hollenbeck burrito. PORK. Presentation:Great. The ultra big. Taste: Not the best. Slightly above average. Some what bland.  Maybe my taste buds were off... Portion: Enough to feed 3 people. Atmosphere:Friendly. Clean.. I will try the chicken next time. Overall, it was average. Nothing out of the ordinary..except for the size. Would I return? Yes. Average is still good.... But dont expect anything out of the ordinary.

The staff is friendly and the service was fast. I was curious about the giant burritos that were featured on Man vs Food but came to find out that they don't live up , they lacked flavor and it was just too much with nothing to offer. The steak nachos were better. Never get the chicken burrito it is awful and yes they are huge and could feed multiple people. There is parking and the menu offers many choices.

Is that a 5 lb burrito or are you just happy to see me? Finding El Tepeyac was a bit of a trek, especially if traveling from OC. If you use a gps navigator, it will weave you in and out of streets that you have never been too. When you finally get there you will see a restaurant that stand out on its own across the street from a church and a school. I not sure if the locals visit this place, but I am positive that there was a lot of anticipation going in to El Tepeyac. I think everyone in line was a Manuel's virgin and everyone watched Man Vs Food. I tried not to fear the hype and give this restaurant a fair chance. I was praying that Adam Richman would not let us down. Mr. Manuel was very nice to greet all his waiting customers and insure that he would take good care of us. After about 30 minutes of waiting (not bad), I was finally inside! (no pun intended) On the menu, the legendary Manuel Special was staring me in the face. I thought I should know my limits and just order a regular. Everything look good on the menu and everything was around 8-10 dollars, except 20 ish for the Manuel Special. I saw a family of 5 try to take on this, but failed. I'm pretty sure I could finish it with 2 or 3 people :P. I took on the Hollenbeck Chili Verde. The 2.5 lb baby version of the famous 5 lb. Man o Man was it good! The only reason I didn't finish it. I wanted to save a small portion for a friend to try. Honestly, I excepted it to blow my socks off, which it didn't, but man did it bring back memories of going to a friend's house and getting homemade slow roasted pork at a friends birthday party. Everything in the burrito went together perfectly. MMMmm Cheese, gucamole, beens, and chili verde pork MMMM. I think I just made myself hungry writing this review. The service was exceptional. It was a little busy, so don't except 5 star service. The El Tepeyac staff made me feel like they actually wanted to serve and please the customers. Unlike, most restaurant where the servers have a "I hate my life" look underneath the fake smile. If I am ever in the LA area and my friend offers to drive. I will definitely go back. If you are trekking from OC, I suggest Maybe going... Highly recommend to locals. The best in LA? That's for you to decide. I barely scratched the service of fine Mexican food dinning in LA. Best MVF restaurant so far... Orochon Ramen and Philippe The Original were okay. Damn I want a 5 lb burrito right about now. :) Happy Yelp Year! Thank you Yelp fans and people that read my reviews. Thanks for my shinny new Elite '11 badge. SYOY

El Tepeyac Cafe is what Yelp was born for.  This is one of those hole in the wall spots that  most every East LA'er knows about and then slowly trickles down to everyone else who loves good filling food.  Since it looks like the "Hollenbeck" burrito is the topic of discussion by everyone I will talk about their breakfasts.  The Chorizo is amazing...the heuvos rancheros are mouth watering.  Especially if your hanging over from the night before.  If you show up on a Sunday you might have to negotiate your arrival on the Church's schedule.  It seems like they get a flood of patrons before and after each Mass.  But if you dont care about waiting in a 5-10 minute line then just GO....GO NOW!  My mom and dad used to tell me a story that Manny the owner opened up his restaurant next to the church to get God's blessing.  Although, I have my own beliefs now, I think he made the right decision.  But I think its the amazing food that brings the peeps...you be the judge.   I dont know if it should be mentioned on this website but there is a suprise on certain sundays when Manny is in a good mood.  I will let you find out....its especially nice if you havnt stopped partying from the night before...(you bad kids)

Fresh from viewing the L.A. episode of the Travel Channel's "Man vs. Food", my Yelp-vision was set on El Tepeyac as an establishment of high potential for my continuing search for Food Victories in the Los Angeles area. Now, I might be a little late in the game when it comes to El Tepeyac.  Sure, I only know of it due to my healthy television-viewing habits.  Maybe if I were a bit more natively Angelino, it'd be old news.  This place is hefting a solid 150+ Yelp reviews at an impressive average of four stars. Oh dear, oh dear. Let me knock that shit down a bit, shall I? Certainly TV has a way of glamorizing things.  What I saw on my screen was a fun, traditional, homey little place with a cheerful old dude handing out shots of Tequila like the Santa Claus of alchohol, with a staff jammin' away to churn out some delicious looking burrito-tastic fare that had the whole patronage grinning and munching away. What's difficult to reckon, then, is how I could stop in on a sunny Thursday, ready for this great experience, and instead find: -Inattentive window-girl half-assedly taking orders and trying to snap a price at us and get us out of her way after each item we asked for.   -Pickup window-guy screaming our number repeatedly as if he'd been waiting for us an hour instead of the ten seconds it took to push through the crowd and get to the pickup window. -Same guy more or less throwing our plates into my arms and turning away.  Thankfully I've carried plates as a job before, or I'd have had difficulty trying to juggle these without dropping. -Chips and Salsa served with no salsa, no salsa bar available to get ourselves, and staff pointedly ignoring us politely asking for some. -The blandest-ass burrito I've ever tasted, including goddamned Rubio's.  A Burrito de Pollo at El Tepeyac is, apparently, two or so cans worth of shitty pulled chicken, unflavored, with a tablespoon or so of refried beans, in a tortilla.  If there were any hint of salt, peper or hot sauce available it might have been salvaged, but again, staff ignores inquiries on where to find anything of the sort.  I ate about half the burrito waiting for it to get good, but there's only so much plain-ass, flavorless pulled chicken with a scrap of tortilla a guy can eat without getting depression from boredom. I really wanted to enjoy this place.  Maybe the experience is different inside; we used the outside ordering window/line.  I don't know.  To their credit, a guy did come down the table line outside asking if everything was okay, and at the time having not tasted the food yet, I said it was.  To their discredit, we wanted to bring our food home and try to salvage it here with some spices and sauces, but the staff (to no surprise at this point) wouldn't acknowledge us asking for any take-home container. Sorry, El Tepeyac.  I don't know if I came on an off-day, or what, but that was some bullshit, you guys, especially at a price-tag of 8+ bucks per entree.  Maybe I'll give you another shot someday.  Oh wait, I can still get the most delicious mexican food ever from a friendly staff for a quarter of the price at Huarache Azteca.  Yeah, never mind, fuck you.

Been coming here for all 30 of my 30 years. My parents used to come here on a weekly basis and although my dad passed away, my mom still come here in a regular basis. I used to always get a 7 up in the can but they have recently changed to all fountain drinks. Love the hollenbeck and manuel's special, but my favorites are chile rellenos and taquitos with guacamole!

if you think you know burritos...you. must. try. this. place.  this is, hands down, the best burrito place in the world (that i've experienced...hahha)!   i recommend the machaca burrito...which i check at every burrito place i go to.  yes, this place is quantity but it is actually superior in quality.  the tortillas are amazing!  the meat is soo juicy and it's full of many other ingredients that bring out the savory flavor.   just a warning though...if you want a "light" and "nice" burrito you will be PUNCHED IN THE GUT...these are hardcore burritos...not for the faint hearted...literally.

The burrito is huge. HUGE. It's like all of the world's burritos joined forces to form one giant superburrito. It must've weighed as much as a small infant. Seriously, it is that big. I got a vegetarian burrito for the low, low price of $7.35. Considering that one burrito is like three or four meals for me, that's a fucking bargain. There was no line, and my take-out order was ready in five minutes. I was under the impression that "vegetarian" meant veggies, but I think it just meant no meat; there were no veggies other than in the salsa. But the generous amount of guacamole did make it delicious (and perhaps the avocados in the guacamole count as vegetables?).

Manuel's burritos have a legendary reputation in LA, particularly for their size.  The Manuel special is about 5 lbs.  Sadly, in this case, size is not the only thing that matters.  I found their burrito to be very run-of-the-mill and nothing special.  There is a bit of a cult following with many local diehards.  If your idea of good food is a giant burrito inundated with sauce and cheese, then this just might be the place for you.  For those who prefer quality over quantity, I would steer clear - LA is home to so many taquerias and burrito shops with much more character and flavor.  The one good thing was that I was able to stretch that one burrito into 4 more meals!

one of my first field trips to the east side... there are so many places i've wanted to try - but never had anyone to go with... well, my experience here was rather, er, unique - but i suppose the memories will be fondly remembered - for the silliness that it was... after a puff from one of those funny little *cigarettes* i retreated into my own world... i was in my own little bubble, just me and the plate of eggs & chorizo with bean and rice... it was very good, and i was isolating each item on my fork - to taste everything individually.  i was concentrating so hard on my little task - gathering food onto my fork so carefully... "Wow - you are so strange when you eat" um, yeah - i wasn't alone... i was totally called-out on my bizarre behaviour...  the food was great - what i ended up eating of it... but i just couldn't eat much... i was way too self-conscious at that point... i need to return one of these days...

after starving ourselves for almost the whole morning and afternoon, my cousin and i decided to come here and tackle the 5lb burrito.   when we first walked in the whole place was packed.  But of course it would be packed cause they only have like 6 tables in the entire place.  we waited about 15 minutes in their waiting room (which is really the side walk outside) and then we were seated.  the lady taking our order kept rushing us to order.  After we ordered we waited about 15 minutes for the gigantic burrito to arrive.  It looked very satisfying and smelled exceptional, but the taste sucked.  The food tasted as if they dont know how to use salt and pepper.  As big as the burrito was i felt like i was eating more onion, tomato and salsa than i was carne asada.  Even when i had a bite of the carne asada it didnt taste too good.  ive tasted better else where.   it just looked so good on man vs food when adam richmond was eating it.  i think id rather go to alfredos or albertos for a burrito.

i made the mistake of reading the first review in which some (and i mean this in a loving way) dumbo compares an institution (ET of course!) to baja fresh and chipotle.  that would be tantamount to comparing guadalajara to san francisco; i.e., there is no comparison.  i will say that it is not the size of the portion that has given life to my 15 year relationship with ET.  heck, the wait can be friggin' annoying.  the seating and service leave much to be desired as well.   but, alas, the food is good.  so what if they don't serve asada or al pastor (or adobada while we're on the subject)!  fact is the burrotes (FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HABLA:  burrito = small; burrote = big); the enchiladas; the hardshell tacos; the flautas are good.  not delicious, not yummy, not DA BOMB.  i said good and i meant good.  why y'all think the place has been around since way before a lot of us had real social security numbers?

I've been eating at this place ever since I was in my mother's womb, literally!  Honestly, the only thing that's changed is it's prices.  I absolutely love this place!  When I go to sit down and eat, I ALWAYS get is their taquito plate.  SO DELICIOUS!  My job is close by, so when we have parties we always get the Manny's special.  This burrito is sooo huge.  It says that it can feed 4 people, but my department is made up of 8 people and we still have left overs.  I really enjoy eating at the restaurant.  Once in a while you'll get a visit from Manny, the owner of Tepeyac.  He walks around like everyone is his friend and offers each person a free shot of tequila.  How could I not give this place 5 stars?

No, this is not authentic Mexican food. One does not come here for mole', tacos, seafood, or any of the ordinary associations. But they make by far the biggest and best burritos around. I've been coming here with my parents since I was a kid, and my personal fave is the steak picado burrito, which is spicy with large chunks of beef inside and topped wet with sauce and steak. Delicious. Also good are the machaca and oki. And the orders of guacamole are perfectly done, too, make sure to get one for the table. The waitresses are always kind even when hurried, and though the line outside may look daunting, it never seems to take too long.

This was one of my haunts back in High School...yes, me and my friend would eat a whole Manny's Special Burrito between the two of us!  But no more!  I ordered a Hollenbeck Chili Verde and it was just as freakin' awesome as I remember!  If you want a burrito that you know you can't finish when you look at it (but you sure as hell are gonna try), this is the place for you!  This place never changes, everything is exactly the same, including the people who work here...I love this place!  Don't tell my doctor I went here, he might get upset...I checked into this place on FB and later in the day, three other of my FB people checked in as well...it was the pictures that did it...

This place has the East-Los ambiance and location that you want in an authentic LA Mexican joint, but disappointingly the food is underwhelming (minus 2 stars), and not that cheap (minus another star) to boot. We had the Carne Asada and Hollenback (still not sure) burritos, huevos rancheros, and a taco combo plate.  All were extremely average. They have a window and outside tables along the side for overflow from the small dining room. Why hit this place when there are so many better choices for Mexican in LA?  The only reason I can think of is if you need some of those jumbo family-size burritos for a party or something, which we did see some people take away.  Otherwise, nothing special here.

Last time I frequented this establishment was in the 80's. Nothing changes in Boyle Heights. The service was fast and efficient. The chips delicious with a side of guacamole. The salsa's tasty (two different types). Then the major attraction came out, we all ordered burritos, four to be exact. The damn things didn't fit on the table. They we're really good, but the size impresses you more then the quality. I'd go back just to try and eat the grande burrito( i think its called Manuel's) but I've had better Mexican food.

Where can i start...larges portions, mediocre meats or crowded location...well on the positive side at least i didn't leave hungry. The television show "Man vs Food" made me come here so when i did i got the Manuel's Especial...let me just say that it was the biggest burrito i have every eaten. But the damage was not worth it. I ad a stomach ache for days it was not worth it. Im glad i visited but its a once in a life time place for me. They also refilled our drinks but didn't tell us about the "hidden fee" so i would recommend it but have the Pepto ready at home

El Tepeyac has to be one of the best eateries in the Los Angeles area hands down. Its definitely in my top ten list of best places to go for the best Mexican food without crossing the border. No I don't mean Taco Bell (remember the slogan). There may not be the blood and hair on the walls as I expected but good food and good times are in abundunce. First up, a platter of carnitas. Tender juicy steaming pulled pork loaded on a warm tortilla and eaten immediately. The hot juices running down your chin while the briightly flavored salsa hits the back of your throat is tolerable. Hey, why don't we have a shot of tequila to go with our meal? Why sure, why not? The only problem is that alcohol is not served here. Happy hour down street does serve some great Mexican beers however. Another tasty treat is the fava bean and cactus soup or sopa de nopales con frijoles. Its delicous and made only by request. It helps to know the staff on a first name basis. I like to call El Tepeyac a cross between great street food and sit down food. You can get the best of both worlds. Here is an example. Any great Mexican joint in any geographical location is probably going to serve the best tacos, sopes, gorditas, tamales, enchiladas, posole, burritos (not very Mexican) etc. ever. At El Tepeyac you will see some entrees on the menu that are usually served street side in most parts in Mexico, however at El Tepeyac its served in a nice comfortable restaurant setting. Just look for the streets for the good stuff and stay away from the fast food crap. Follow your nose and carry your ass to the Yac. The Yac's tacos with asada and pastor are described in one word only: sublime. If you have the stomach as I do, try some tripe, tongue, stomach and brains because you will be surprised on how good the nasty bits taste. I could go on forever and before you know it I've written a novel on how good Mexican food is. Go seek and explore El Tepeyac and you will not be disappointed. If you are then I will buy your meal personally.

Quantity My Dears does Not equal Quality. This place is WAY over hyped, maybe back in the day they had good food, but now it's just not good.  I've given this place 3 chances & was let down each time.  This is not authentic mexican food..mexican food has flavor some spice.  You eat it as you think 'This is O So Bad for Me..but its O So Good!!!   At El Tepeyac you eat it thinking 'This so not Good. Why is my meat so dry & chewy? How old is this crap? The Chili Relleno - was under cooked The Chili Verde burrito - meat was dry, tough Bean burrito - just beans nothing speacial, no real extra flavor in beans. Asada - unimpressive The one star is for the older man(Manuel?) who walks around conversing with people & the fact that we each got a free shot. This place is just not worth the drive or the wait in line. And the waitstaff is a bit on the rude side!!  Perhaps a little full of ourselves cause of the TV spots??

Honestly, this is great Mexican food. Most definitely the best I have been able to find in Cali. The prices of all the dishes are fair. You get what you pay for. Go to any chain restaurant and tell me that you get a better quality and quantity for the same price. Just for those of you complaining about the price. The carne asada is great. It has a crunch that cannot be forgotten. Tacos are greesy, but it's Mexican food come on that's a given. Overall great food and great service. I will say the area is rather "sketchy". Don't be supposed if you get "holler-ed" at. Regardless I will continue going here. Two thumbs up.

Went today with my family service was good but we were very disappointed in the food.  My 11 yrs old had a bean and cheese burrito it was horrible, the beans tasted like they were out of a  can, the burrito was greasy.  We also ordered the the manuels speacial and the chile relleno burrito and it was not good at all. Everyone in my party got sick within 1hr of leaving this place. We went to this place because we had heard nothing but good things but not worth the drive to ELA.  Definately do not recommend.

Wow, what a disappointment. I went here because I had heard that this was one of the best mexican restaurants in LA. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was full but not too busy. Friday-Sunday they offer a dish called menudo (tripe soup kinda thing). I was in the mood for something special so I ordered it. Biggest mistake EVER! I have been eating menudo since I was a kid. Sometimes homemade, sometimes store bought and once in a while out of a can. I thought the stuff out of the can was the lowest of the low until I had El Tepeyac's. It seemed as if they had made a big batch the week before and it didn't sell so they put it in the freezer for next week. When my food arrived I immediately noticed something odd. Typically the broth is light, red and full of flavor. El Tepeyac's was almost like a stew and it tasted like it looked, horrible. The meat was completely over boiled, probably from the reheating. I ate about 1/6th of the bowl and could not go any further. When the waitress brought the check she looked at my bowl and didn't even ask if I wanted to go. She did, however, offer to box up everything else.   The guacamole seemed like it was from the costco frozen food section. The salsa was a complete joke, I've had more flavor and spice in rice cakes. I think the popularity of this place is due to the giant burritos. Big hairy deal.

3 generations of my family have been coming to this place, walking from Roosevelt High and ordering food. Hollenbeck burrito de machaca without the egg, only 9 dollars. You might think $9 for just a burrito is expensive, but this burrito is HUGE, enough to share with another person. In it you get the shredded beef, rice, beans, jalapenos, and guacamole yummm. I'm telling you, you have to try this place.

The restaurant is very small inside and its a tight squeeze walking down the aisles between tables.  I had the Okie de pollo burrito and I wasn't too fond of the sauce.  My BF ordered the other chicken burrito (not sure of what the name of it was) and he said it was fantastic.  We also had the guacamole which was very good, but the chips were too thick which made them a little hard.  The portion size was HUGE.  I think I was only able to eat 1/3 of the burrito and my BF finished half of his.

1 star for the service 2nd star for being on man vs. food 3rd star for the portions Tried the manuel's special with the steak picado, and it was okay. Sadly we didn't know that the burrito was going to be really saucy, which kind of ruined the burrito for the bf and I. My bf and I shared the burrito, and barely could finish a quarter of the burritio and we eat A LOT! The burrito itself was 25 bucks, but it was worth it for the portion. I would recommend the manuel's special, because it's an experience worth experiencing.

el tepeyac is an angeleno tradition! i was a little girl .. well i could barely reach the counter let alone eat a hollenback ... i remember those huge burritos my dad says if you eat a whole one you get one free or something like that .. i haven't been to the original in quite sometime although my work has catered from them.  there is also an el tepeyac in alhambra but it is in an industrial area so i have yet to venture to it (if anyone has please share) i love the nostalgia of the original and it is real mexican/chicano food hehe ... but i gotta say i prefer the el tepeyac in west covina off the ten fwy cuz of the ambiance and food selection .. altho some of their food is not authentic so warning to the mexicanos. eat here with an open mind. :)

I've been hearing about this place for months, and decided to finally try it out. So, when I got there, I at first thought it was interesting how there's a church right next door. Or something that looks like a prayer section. Anyhow, I went on a Saturday morning, and of course, it was packed. My friends and I decided to eat outside. Ordering through the window, I got a peek inside (where the stove is at)...and what I saw was nasty.. but yummy. Nasty as in, all the pots and pans had cheese and other stuff oozing out, and yummy because it smells sooooo good. The food here I'll admit, is very cheap, but as for health.., um... might want to consider another place to eat. Only reason I'm giving a 1 star is because I ended up ordering something, which is totally my fault, that wasn't the greatest. Well, there was no taste because it was just a rice and beans burrito. But what my friends order, looked yummy. So, FYI, don't order the rice and beans burrito. Order a authentic Mexican breakfast.

We went out of way to eat here, of course because of its appearance on Man vs. Food. The Manuel special was more than enough for FOUR of us and it was damn good all the way to the end.  The guacamole is extremely fresh and we had enough to take home. Also, the food came out within minutes of ordering.  There was a line-up when we got there for lunch but it was worth the wait. It's a hot, small dining area but there is also a take-out counter on the side for those that want don't want to dine-in. Recommended!

to say that the portions at el tepeyac are "generous" is a severe understatement. they're gargantuan. even colossal. example: the guacamole comes broken down in fractions. you can get a whole, a half or a quarter order. and a quarter order will feed two with room to spare. i was there last night, and one of the first things i saw was two dinosaur-sized hollenbeck burritos making their way out of the kitchen. they were seriously the diameter of a human neck, and around twice as long. proceed with caution. and dexterity. the flavors are always fresh and complex. the enchilada sauce has the tart edge of tomato with the spicy aroma of chili powder. the chicken is fresh white meat. the rice is tender and fluffy, and when mixed with beans and cheese,  creates a savory taste sensation. crunchy tacos are layered with fresh, chilled tomato and lettuce and around as much shredded cheddar as half of one of those bags you buy at the grocery store. i kid you not. they have several salsas. there's a chile arbol that is awesome when spooned into the guacamole, a salsa verde that provides a nice tomatillo bite, and this other one that they seem to have sometimes and completely deny others. it's a red salsa with green chiles in it. i have plenty of friends who prefer the tacos al carbon stylings of every other place in town. a friend of mine professed that only people who grew up in california crave family-style mexican food, and he may be right. all i know is that when i'm really hungry, and it is mexican food that my mouth is watering for, el tepeyac is the place to be and the place to go.

I have been on Yelp for awhile and have never been so compelled to write a review about any place I've been to... until now. Ok, so I have been coming to El Tepeyac for as long as I can remember. I remember being a little girl, and looking forward to going there with my parents, and the owner, Manuel, giving us candy. My family has been going there for decades. So of course, I ranted and raved about this place to my boyfriend, and after a trip to Lincoln Heights to try Mom's Tamales (and finding out it was closed at 1pm due to running out of food), we decided to go to Tepeyac. OMG, it sucked! Seriously, a disappointment. My boyfriend was not a happy camper as this was his first time. We ordered from the outdoor window as there was a line to eat inside the restaurant.  The service was terrible.They lagged at taking our order. My boyfriend and I were at the window for awhile before the girl decided to take down our order. She was too busy talking crap about one of the customers to one of the guys in the kitchen. I was appalled by this. I also didn't remember the food being so terrible! I ordered the #8, the torta de guacamole. Usually, a torta is a sandwich... umm.. tell me why it was basically a GUACAMOLE OMELLETTE!. OMG.. gross... My boyfriend ordered the Hollenbeck Burrito with Carnitas. It tasted like dog food. It was too wet, juices were all over the place. He was pissed because he had been craving carnitas all day, and that was NOTHING close to that. I text my mom to tell her that it was the worst experience there that I can remember and even she was surprised. Needless to say, I don't think we'll be coming back here which sucks because it brings me memories of my childhood.

So this place was Boyle Heights at one point. The food was great and you tasted the mexicano status in the flavor and salsa.the lines are still long at the door but the food is not all that good any more, the meat is chunky and rough the beans taste out the can. At one point this was the weekend spot but it has now become just one more burrito place. the food has gone from being home grown to cater to the masses, its still a spot to eat, but not like before, try the tepeyac special, or the hollenbeck they are great if your a first timer.

Manny's!  The first time I came here, I came with my PE coaches from the nearby High School.  The second time I came here, I got lost looking for a sign that said "Manny's" instead of "El Tepeyac Cafe".  I had to pull over and ask someone where to get my Hollenbech burrito.  :)  The man pointed and said Manny's is that way.   Everything has already been said.  The portions here are huge.  And for a little Chinese girl like me, it's enough to feed me Monday-Wednesday, lunch & dinner.  But you've got to try it at least once.  Tostadas are good too... and I'm usually not a fan of deep fried hard shelled stuff like taquitos- but duuuude.  The taquitos here are good.  And the guac?  Off the hook.  Just be willing to share because you'll need to.

Oh, how I crave the Hollenbeck burrito. This burrito is the King of all burritos in my book. It has succulent chunks of pork braised in their version of chile verde, but it's not green. It's a fantastic tomato based stew filled with onions and seasonings. The burrito is filled with the pork and sauce, rice, beans, and guacamole. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I make the trip to E. LA every time I visit my parents, who live in Chino. I live in Vegas and there is nothing like El Tepeyac out here. I started going to ET when I was a freshman in High School, which was 23 years ago. Nothing has changed about this place. The service may not be the friendliest but you go there to eat and get out. I've observed they may tend to be a little friendlier to the latino patrons but overall have never had a horrible experience here. Seating is very limited on the inside but they also have self seating on the side of the restaurant. You go to the order window, place your order, pay, and just seat yourself. The food is abundant in all their dishes. The Manuels Special, which is the much larger version of the Hollenbeck but with cheese on top, runs 17.99 and can feed 4 people. I've also had the taquitos(huge shredded beef filled), chicken tacos, carne asada, and other dishes and they are ALL good. The guacamole is fresh, meaning not watered down and runny. Very chunky with large pieces of real avocado. I also like their style of rice and beans, never hard or greasy. This place is definitely reliable for good eating so bring a HUGE appetite!

This place charges $9.00 for a burrito, and it took 35 minutes for us to get our food on a Tuesday afternoon, what a joke. It might taste good if your fresh off the plane from Iowa, but if your a true Californian, I would pass.

So my girlfriend was telling me that she only eats mexican food from 2 places. Her moms kitchen and El Tepeyac. The place is small and can get packed!!! Everyone there is really nice and quite energetic so expect a nice conversation if you sit at the counter. Looking around I saw a lot of Burritos and they were pretty huge but that's not was I was in the mood for. We ordered a side a guacamole for our chips and it was just made in the back not just scooped from a tub, but the salsa was a little bland. Luckily that was the only downside of the night. I ordered The Machaca dinner plate and the portion was pretty huge. I've had machaca at other places but I can honestly say this was one of the best I've had. Just writing this is making mouth water!!!! Anyway, I tried some of my girlfriends chilaquiles and lets just say my own step-mom could never make chilaquiles like that. We couldn't even finish our dinners because of the portions. We left saying those famous words after a really good meal, "I cant brief!!!" On a side note, on the wall I saw a photo of Manuel and the guy from Man vs Food ( I just barely started watching the show so i don know his name) All I cans say is that the Manuel Special looks tasty and I wanna split it with a couple people. Who is down with me??

came here with some friends to order a giant burrito... we ended up getting some nachos "to start" with... needless to say after said gigantic platter of nachos we were reconsidering our decision of getting a giant burrito each, so we ended up splitting one... the sauce seemed like it should have been a bit stronger but everything was good overall... service was friendly and helpful... place is definitely a landmark so worth stopping in

I've been here twice and have been very pleased on both occasions. The staff is very courteous and polite from the moment you step in... till the moment you step out. Now the food: Awesome! I've only had their hollenbeck burritos which are phenominal by burrito standards. Aside from my beloved burrito... I had a bite of shrimp from the camarones al mojo de ajo plate which was quite tasty. Always an enjoyable experience.

What can I say? If you go to East L.A. (which thanks to the new gold line is super easy!) you must stop by El Tepeyac- its an East L.A. staple and for good reason- BURRITOS! Now, you can't eat here all the time, alas diabetes is not cute nor good for you, but man do they know their burritos. Try the Hollenbeck burrito and share with all of your co-workers, or a wet burrito, (share it with 2 or more friends). Oh, and don't forget the horchata- You will thank me!

You may call me the Gringo of East LA, if you wish. I still say, I look good in a sombrero though. I have logged more miles, consulted more maps, acquired more frequent flier miles, painstakingly tracking down a multitude of over the counter food establishments, rummaged through an amalgamation of hole-in-the-walls, I have tested a thousand and one, so called ethnic places; scurrying forth with nothing more than a scant word of the mere reference of a good Mexican restaurants. I love them and they stretch forth as far as the eye can see. We may have more Mexican restaurants in Southern California than American restaurants?  It is Heaven on earth for this Restaurant Reporter.  With so many restaurants the options are limitless but too many have above average food and drinks that remind me of cough medicine!!!  Or the drinks are good but the food is uninspiring!!!  Well my friends, since I am observing temperance with liquor to begin the New Year, the food part of this story will be central. This past week, I dined with my friend Janice, (who claims to be a restaurant critic that is soon to be discovered), I trekked down to the Original El Tepeyac Café on Evergreen, in the heart of East LA. The restaurant has a modest space twelve to fifteen seats plus a with a counter and ample parking.  The atmosphere is lively and the patrons like Los Angeles itself, come from a cross-section of our colorful city.  What brings patrons from all parts of the city to this Café?  It's the food, and it's muy excellente.  Portions are large and you'll always seem to leave with half of your food in a to-go bag.  I'm telling you, I unwisely tried to order the whole menu so I could give a full report on this restaurant, but I failed, the portions are too big. I asked the server for a few suggestions and I went with the Taquitos with Guacamole ($7), as soon as saw this plate arrive, I realized that I ordered for a whole team and not just for the two of us.  Next was the Manuel tacos, my friend Janice wouldn't share, but by the look in her eyes, I can tell she was pleased, or was it that I am handsome?  Why does it always have to be one or the other? Okay it was the food!! Next, I tried the signature dish at El Tepeyac, the burrito, my selection was the #2 A chile Colorado at ($10) this is a great dish and is pork slowly simmered in a red chili sauce.  That is Mexican Heaven! You know it is good when the men in blue (cops) are dinning there on a regular basis.  The Hollenbeck Burrito is a favorite of the police and is ($8.25) and comes with chips and guacamole.  Next time I'm going to order the Okie de Pollo...shredded chicken breast at ($8.50) It is a curious name, what does El Tepeyac mean? It is the hill that the Virgin Mary was sighted on!!!  This place is a shrine as well! No beer or wine.

Delicious burritos!!  Burrito weighs in at about 2lbs which is massive!  Every bite is delicious despite the burrito's size.  Hollenbeck with chile verde and okie asada burrito are my favorites.  Two people could share a burrito with chips and guacamole and be good.  They also have something called the Manuel's Special, which is a 6 pound behemoth recommended for 4 people.

This is one of my absolute favorite places to go eat!  This is usually a line to get in but that shouldn't discourage you because it is defiantly worth the wait!  And if you go in the morning you may get to meet the owner Manuel and he will keep you coming back for years.  I've been going here since I was a little kid and my dad has been coming here since he was a little kid.

El Tepeyac has some of the best Mexican food in LA, especially the burritos and chilaquiles. If your'e feeling brave one day go and have a man vs. food moment of your own with the Manuel's special burrito. This burritos is huge enough to feed 2-4 people , loaded with guacamole and topped with mounds of slowly cooked Chile Verde pork and cheese, and not that bad for around $18. Just don't go around lunch time (1-3pm) because you'll be waiting outside in line for a while. Oh!..and as soon as you go inside expect to take a shot of tequila with Manuel himself!.

I have been going to this place for at least 40 years.  Yes, the prices have gone up.  Yes, you could find other places that may have something a little better.  And for all those haters,  I say fine - dont come here, more room for me.  Why do I keep coming back?  For a city that claims Bob's Big Boy in Burbank as a City Landmark,  El Tepe or as many call it, Manuels - offers a link to the past and a path to the future.  I ate many burritos here with my Dad.  The food is always consistant and the service great.  There is always a line which must say that El Tepe is doing something right. If you come to El Tepe, be prepared to eat lots and go home with a smile

By far, the biggest burrito I have ever had in my life! Cheap price, good service, EXCELLENT food. Remember to give the fries a try. I shared a burrito with 2 others and we barely skimmed the half way line at the end of our meal. This is how good their burrito is- my sister who has been a vegetarian for well over 2 years was one of those 'others' who shared the BEEF burrito with me. MMHMM! That is ALL I need to say. Try it and you won't regret it. I promise you. BEWARE! Lines are long! So if your planning on a quick meal, avoid El Tepeyac. I suggest you give this place a try when you have friends(who can eat :P), time, and a mighty appetite.

So I've heard about this place for a few years now.  My Uncle decides out of the blue to go here to eat because he saw it on Man Vs Food.  It was his treat so I couldn't say no!  Anyway the Lady that seated us was very friendly, the service here was very homely, if we were to rate it just by the friendliness it would be a hands down 5 stars!  But we are here to talk about the food right!! Well everything everyone said about the size of this burrito was correct!  If there was just 3 of us there instead of the 4 we would have finished it still but we would be in some pain!  It was no where near the best tasting burrito Ive ever had but it did sure live up to its name.  I had to drop it a star (I wish there was a 1 and 1/5 option) because we ordered the special Nachos and they truly sucked.  Stale chips and the topping was beans and cheese.  How can you screw up nachos...  Over all I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon, I love their attitudes and kindness but that won't make my taste buds happy!

Your first time is usually memorable when it comes to this place.  If you live on the east side it quickly becomes a ritual and then a tradition.  It's always best to bring people here who don't know what it's all about.  Their "holy sh(t" expressions when they get their hollenbeck or (heaven forbid) Manuel's special is worth the trip in itself. Make sure you come here with an appetite...or at least a good buzz.

For the amount of food and the price, you can't beat this place.  The Manuel's Special was described in Playboy many, many years ago, as a buritto as big as  a football.   Back in the day, if you were able to eat TWO Manuel's Specials at one sitting you'd get $100 bucks.  It was latter changed to $50 and now I think too many people have collected, so you get a free Manuel's Special, maybe you get nada, today.  I don't know.   All I know is that my parents used to pick up food there and it would last for days.  It was good food and I enjoyed it and I still do.   When ever I'm remotely in the area, I will gladly pick up food there.   I've taken some of my Hispanic friends there and they would complain that it isn't "real" Mexican food!  WTF??  You look at the "line" and all you see are Hispanic as well as "gringos".  There is always some type of line there, that should be a testament to how good the place is.  These same friends will gladly eat at Taco Bell and Del Taco, so I don't know what they are talking about.   Well I never heard of a "Gourmet" Mexican Restaurant but if there is, it's El Tepeyac at Mickey D prices.

Went earlier today with my brother, and as always, the Hollenbeck served its purpose.  Delicious, spicy, tomatoe-y broth filled with chunks of carnitas and  pockets of guacamole throughout the burrito. Service was fast as always. I guess ever since this place was featured on Man vs Food, business has shot up for Manuel. Good for him though, he works there ALL the time, he was even there today and offered me a beer. This is why I have been coming here for 18+ years, not for the beer, but for the delicious food and warm hospitality

I've been to this place 3 times. I heard about this place from a co-worker. When I saw his burrito I just had to go. I tried the hollenback. My first thought: meh, Chipotle is better (and let me tell you, I don't really like Chipotle). The second time I went was because a friend saw it on Man vs. Food. We get there and I order something different. Same thing: meh. I made the mistake of going there a 3rd time. I order the shredded tacos and an horchata. Tacos: flavorless. The horchata was so sweet I couldn't drink it. I really want to give it another chance just because it's supposed to be an LA gem. Sorry Manuel, I won't go back.

I had the machaca hollenbeck burrito here and it's super tasty. What really makes it though is the amount of avocado they give you and the red sauce, which is fantastic. The portions are huge, as everyone notes, and next time I'll probably split this burrito 'cause there's no way I could finish it. I also love that it's mom and pop and the owner walks around saying hello to everyone. :)

moving to east LA meant (among other things) that i had to be introduced to el tepeyac, or manuel's as some call it. the first trip here i was underwhelmed, i think i had a burrito of some kind. the second time, however, i got the chile relleno. jackpot. every time since then, i get the chile relleno. it's HUGE, and if you get the dinner version (with beans & rice) it's definitely enough to share with another person, and STILL have leftovers. my suggestion- ask for an extra flour tortilla before you leave (they will charge you 75 or 90 cents for this, but it's worth it) and use whatever beans, rice, and chile you have left to make a burrito. then you can take your leftovers to go and have them the next day, when you're still craving manuel's but don't want to drive there again. also, their guacamole is awesome. and get the horchata. for a chile relleno dinner plate, plus 2 horchatas and a side of guacamole, we spend around $20, including tip. and it's really not in a dangerous area, just don't go snooping around in the yards of the houses on that street. as long as you park in the parking lot, eat, and leave, you have nothing to worry about.

OMG! one of the biggest f'ckn burritos i've seen in my life!  My boyfriend and I and our Dupree (his friend john that loves to be a third wheel) drove up from san diego all the way to LA to eat @ El tepeyac, we decided to take the challenge and order a Manuel special # 2 it was the pork giant burrito, i loved the fact that it had melting cheese all over, i also had their "horchata" and it was one of the best! Me and my boyfriend shared one of the burritos and john had his own, he was on a mission to finish it, i almost puke just looking at him try! me and my boyfriend didnt eat not even half! and john made it pretty far!

I was told about these massive burritos years ago by a friend. I finally went to go try them on my lunch break since it's in the area. Waited in a line to order for about 10 minutes the food did not take that long. I ordered the Holenbeck. It was huge. The food was bland. This place is just about the portions and hype. I would not travel from Whittier to just eat here. If you haven't tried it try it, if you are in the area.

The ONLY reason I came here was because of Guy.   I came here for a take out many many many months ago and I can still remember how disappointing the food was.  I almost wanted to say awful but that would be too mean.   The portions are huge and not worth it because of the quality in taste.  People were lining up outside the establishment and I can't imagine how long it would take to get a table inside.  Luckily, I phoned in to take my food home.   I ordered tacos, a burrito and a chicken quesadilla.  Everything tasted bland.  It was so bland I thought it was healthy Mexican food.  The chicken quesadilla I had was ek.  The chicken was shredded and probably was boiled with seasoning.  I want my chicken to be chopped and grilled man!  Honestly, I've never had shredded boiled chicken quesadilla before.  I'm sure it was boiled because you can't shred a chicken that has been grilled.  I'm not even going to start describing the burrito or taco.   This place is just not for me.  I'm better off at King Taco or Taco Mexico.

Ok, this is my first time here so please take this into consideration. When we got there the line was up the very small parking lot. We had to park on the street (no biggie though), we were being entertained the the owner Manuel (he's really adorable). We waited almost 1 hour because it's that small. You could eat outside and order there (there was not much of a line) except it was cold and rainy so of course everyone wanted to eat inside where it was cozy and warm. We sit finally, tiny little place, like 8-9 tables and a booth. The waitress comes, takes our orders, we get guac/chips, Mom gets small menudo and coffee, Me and Hubby got the famous Hollanbeck Burrito. The food comes out all backwards with several minutes in between making the stuff cold. The waitresses are all family so they have this could give two sh**ts if they get fired cause they won't (kind of attitude).   Eventually our waitress leaves, (not saying bye or anything) we are left with no refill offers or anything! Ugh! Just leaves?? The food was medioce, my mom thought her re-heated menudo was good. Our burrito's were gigantic, with 80% rice and beans then some chile verde pork, I kept digging for meat and when if finally came it was good, not the best but good and tasty. Guacamole was all avocado, no taste? Needed some lime and salt at least! Come on how hard is it to make guac? We left with an Horchata (was just ok). Would we come back? Honestly, NO. But at least we could say we tried it. On to the next...

I've heard a lot about this place for awhile so my b/f and I decided to finally go. We went in with high expectations, but we were a little disapointed. It's a friendly enviroment, quaint but the food was ok. I've had better food (and I am not talking about Taco Bell or that other crap), and it didn't seem that the food was fresh. We got there around dinner time and the food came out a little too quick. A little bland and chewy for the most part, but hey can't beat an $8 burrito the size of your head.

Huge, bland burritos. Really that's it. The place is an institution, but the food his HIGHLY overrated. And not cheap either. But it has a cute atmosphere and everyone that works here is really friendly. If you want to soak up the east-los vibe without getting sketchy, come here for dinner. Just don't have high expectations. Actually, come to think of it the guac is pretty good, but it is expensive too.

I am a NorCal San Francisco girl at heart, but I do love me some L.A. food...I'll give them that. Thanks to Trisha and BT for an over-the-top awesome trip-- it was practically my birthday present too!! First up, El Tepeyac courtesy of the BF's request/suggestion, which ended up being BT's suggestion too for our arrival lunch. We promised each other we would "snack only" since dinner was a mere four hours away. What a mistake. You see, if you have ever seen "Man Vs. Food", you know where I'm going with this...we got the Manuel special with El Pastor....to share. It fed my BF, BT, Trisha, and I for that "lunch" and the breakfast Saturday morning. The thing was HUGE. I could have swam in the juices that were surrounding the beast of a burrito. And you would think it would be too much, too overwhelming for us, but it was TASTY. Like, really, really tasty. It has just enough spice for my taste, which is more spicy than the usual, but not as spicy as Cancun, and each individual aspect-- the guac, the rice, the pork, has its own unique flavor that layered so nicely upon one another that every bite was something different. Oh, and their cheese was cheddery and salty and pungent, just the way I like it. We also had this drink- jamaica. Fruity and sweet and refreshing. It kind of reminded me of hibiscus juice.

Gotta give it up to the man, Manuel! Great food, superior and excellent service from Ariel and Laura! My overall experience was by far, the best I've ever experienced in my life. Felt like I walked into my moms kitchen! Super recommend this to anyone who is living in or visiting southern cali! A must stop and drop by to get the warmest greeting ever and best mexican food, this side of the border!

I've been coming here since 1971 and I only recently found out that it's real name is El Tepeyac, since everybody always called it "Manuel's." Definitely not a place for nouvelle palates. Like Proust's madeleine, one whiff from the kitchen is enough to push a thousand nostalgia buttons. I live in New York, but I try to make the pilgrimage whenever I'm in L.A.  I have a vague memory of Manuel offering a cash prize to anybody who could eat a "Special Burrito" in one sitting. The stuff of legends.

This place is soo good.  It is definitely pricey, but the food is quick and it's a lot of it.  I love their machaca burrito and the taquitos here are the best I've ever had.  They are huge, unfortunately they also come with a huge price.  I used to live a mile away and would go more often but now I'm working a few blocks away and I know I'm going to be hitting this place up a lot more often.  All the waitresses are sweet and if you sit inside there is a juke box with a variety of artists from Vicente Fernandez to Frank Sinatra and of course all those oldies people associate East L A with.  My favorite thing to play on it is my trio of witchy songs.  Sinatra's Witchcraft, Santana's Black Magic Woman and Witchy Woman by the Eagles.  The food is always fresh and the portions are huge.  Don't be intimidated by the line outside, it will move pretty fast although there are very few tables inside and it is tiny.  There is seating outside and you can always ask for it to go.

All I remember is waiting in line for about 1/2 hour and wondering if my car parked in the neighborhood across the street was going to get jacked, eating a huge plate of something that was pretty good, seeing the wait staff walk by with burritos the size of babies, and not paying a lot for all the food.

We've never eaten in, but we always pick up the Manuel's Special burrito when we have a group of friends over our house. It's huge and very tasty! You can't beat the price for the amount of people it serves. Ask for the spicy red salsa for a flavorful spicy kick! Order some guac & chips and your set for an awesome meal!

To clarify, five stars for the service, history, and character of the joint and three stars for the quality of the food. We get there and line up and Manuel himself comes out to chat us up and entertain us. We get to the front of the line where he talks to us a bunch and suddenly we find ourselves with four shots of a particular Mexican beverage to kick off our dining experience.  The total wait time on a Saturday afternoon was about 15 minutes. The host mistakes our party for a party of four instead of five. When we tell him we can squeeze into the table he brought us to he insists that he just combine the table nearby and we get more than enough room to spread out. We each order a burritos and they're out in no time.  You do not need to order a burritos each. Unless you are or want to be obese, one burritos for two people is more than enough.  Also, don't expect to eat with your hands unless you're Shaq. My Hollenbeck burritos is giant of course. It tastes ok and is pretty soggy with sauce.  The cuts of pork that are inside and outside my burrito seem to be stewed.  The whole burrito seems like it came out of a slow cooker including the sauce.  The guacamole is really tasty but there wasn't enough on my plate. My co-eaters had plenty though. You will probably have leftovers in which case the waitress will gladly pack it all up for you. No mess on your hands. The meal came out to $10 a person and we all had almost 3/4 of a burrito to take home with us.  A great deal.

Some places serve lots of food but the taste is just ok.  They give huge portions and it is very good.  I ordered the smallest burrito on the menu, the Hollenbeck..it was about as big as my forearm...i finished it.  I don't think I've ever been to a place more hospitable than this place...the owner is so kool.  Going back for the Man vs. Food burrito next!

We saw this place on TV, of course, and decided to try it out since my BF lived in LA for 20 something years and never went there (or heard of the place.)  We've been there twice now, and the first time there was no line as it was in between lunch/dinner times. Yesterday we went around 1pm and there was a line, but it went quick. The dining area is very small. Do not attempt to take a huge group and be seated quickly because it's just not going to happen. Unless they have some secret seating area there, which I didn't see.  Picture a room about 30feet long, 25 feet wide, with a bar seating area, that's it folks.   The Food: Their specialty of course is Manuel's special. A pork chili verde burrito with guacamole in and their ranchera sauce. Hmm...now thinking about it, there are two sauces, red sauce and ranchera. I ordered the two cheese enchiladas and they were perfect!  BF ordered the hollenbeck (pork w/ red sauce) and he loved it! The portions are huge. Yesterday we brought along his niece and they split Manuel's special. They served it in a lasagna pan and brought it on a cardboard box!!!!  The two of them only ate about a quarter of it and we took the rest home to Vegas where we live.  Yesterday, I had the vegetarian burrito which had rice, beans, cheese, and guacamole. Delish! I was only able to eat about a quarter of it. I'm not lightweight, I can easily put down 4 slices of pizza, so you can imagine how big the burritos are. Yum! We'll be back! I am destined to get a shot of tequila with Manuel!

I am slightly biased as I grew up around this neighborhood and Manual is actually someone I would consider a friend.  He's seen me grow from 6 years old to now.  Manual would give me water if I was thirsty or feed me for free if I was hungry as a kid.   Putting that aside, the inside is very small, the outside area is also not plentiful but the food is very very good, and still worth it value/price. You get amazing amounts of food for your money and quite frankly, it's just a good place.  If you want more authentic, you can find it... if you want a better deal, you can find it.... but this is truly a landmark of East LA and to miss out on at least eating there once is robbing yourself.  Don't go there with a snobs mentality looking to dissect the food.  Go there to be comfortable, talk with friends, eat A LOT of food... and if Manual is there, ask for a shot of Tequila.... he usually obliges :)

The best Machaca in the Universe! You must eat here! I went to college in LA in the mid 1970s and we used to come here at 2 AM in the morning for late dinner. This is by far the BEST MEXICAN Food I have ever eaten in my 56 years on the planet. I eat Mexican food for about 5 meals a week for the last 30 years, I even dream in Spanish and changed my name from William to Guillermo. LOL Anyway, Manuel, the 75? year old owner, is the happiest little Hispanic leprechaun. He pops in and out with a bottle of tequila and gives patrons a free shot and some kind words and thanks for coming by. The Manuel Special Burrito is a GIANT version of their best sellers. The Special weighs in at about 5 LBS and can seriously feed 2 or 3 hungry people. Their Guacamole is chunky and creamy and fresh. Everything you eat here will take a few days off your life, but oh is it worth it. If I could only eat at 1 place for the rest of my life, El Tepeyac would be that place. It would be a short life, but a very happy one...

Every now and then I'd drive by here and the place always caught my eye.  I went to check it out even before I heard all the hype about it from friends and TV.  The food is crazy-generous and pretty good.  I've been looking for a mexican restaurant that makes refried beans like my girlfriend's mom makes, and I found it!  I looove the refried beans, I could eat it forever.  My husband gets the Manny special and it lasts him for 3 days.  The burrito is as heavy as my new born!  So whenever I go and visit my parents out in east LA and I'm craving for Mexican food, guess we're headed out to...

If you are looking for something cheap, with huge portions. Go to El Tepeyac!!! Nestled away in the heart of East LA, you can find yourself waiting in line for a table. But if you don't have time, you can go on ahead and do a phoner(short for phone order). FYI make sure you give them enough time, or you will be waiting for 10-15mins. Hollenbeck De Asada, a must try!!! Or if you're having a party/group event go for their Manuels Special which will serve about 8 ppl.

Wow I loved their food!! When I got to the restaurant, there was a line waiting to dine inside.  On the side, there's another line for dining outside.   We waited about 15 minutes to order, another 10 minutes to get our food. Their portion is really really huge.  I shared 2 plates with 2 other friends and they eat pretty well.  They have the 5 pound burrito that was on Man vs. Food TV show.   I tried Hollenbeck (pork dish) and their guacamole... their guacamole and sauce were really really yummy! By the time we got up to leave, there was a longer line... It's definitely a place to try if you like authentic Mexican food!

Grew up in the neighborhood and I've been going there for YEARS! Being a big guacamole lover, I highly recommend theirs. Before committing to a big order, try their taquitos with guacamole. They are STUFFED with meat. Their guacamole is fresh and doesn't have that lemony or onion-y flavor other so-called Mexican restaurants have. For vegetarians, they have an awesome guacamole burger. My all-time favorite burritos in order are: #1 -- Hollenbeck Burrito (pork in red chili sauce, rice, beans & guacamole with cheese and more red chili sauce on top) #2 -- Machaca Burrito (shredded beef, jalapenos, onions, cheese & egg) #3 -- Red Chili Burrito (cheaper, with red chili pork meat and beans) You can split a regular burrito between two people if you're not that hungry, OR you can split a Manuel's Special Sized Burrito with two others if you're starving! Here's a tip-- if you want to avoid the line, order outside and either take your order to go or find a spot at an outside table. For even faster service, call your order in for pickup and they will have it ready in 10 - 20 minutes, depending on how busy they are. -PicoChick

First time I came here I was with out-of-towners and they were like wth?  But the food was great and the portions were enormous.  The best part though was waiting for our food and seeing this family eating... they looked like tourists... then their son (like 4 years old) straight got up and yacked all over the floor.  it was awesome.  the dad starts yelling at the restaurant for giving them "bad" food and the kid (love honest kids) was like "NO DAD NO IM SICK!" then the dad turns to his son and half yells "WHY DIDNT YOU SAY ANYTHING IN THE CAR??"  good times.

Tried the Manuel special  Steak Picado burrito for the 1st time, it looked bigger in real life than it did in the picture or on TV!!  I must say the burrito itself was pretty good, i liked the sauce they put on top of it and fresh guacamole inside.  I ate the whole 5 pounder in about an hour with the help of my girlfriend. I thought the price for the monster was a little high, $23 to be exact.  But I guess it was worth it because of all the hype and notoriety it got from Man vs Food.   I would definitely come back and go for a smaller burrito like the Hollenbeck, it's actually big but not as big as the almighty Manuel burrito!!

This old time "hole in the wall" has been a stop for me since the early 90's.  The owner, Manual, has created a great menu - the chorizo is amazing (and I'm a vegetarian). Great for breakfast, with long lines on the weekend.  The difference, between El Tepeyac and franchise restaurants is the authenticity of the flavors - truly Mexican.

I went with a bunch of co-workers to try out this famous place. Everyone at work always said how good this place was. When I got there I realized we were eating at a house...literally its a house that has been I guess the best word is "mex-family-style converted" into a a little restaurant. Its surrounded by residential houses. The menu is a giant plastic board fastened to a neighbors fence. The prices I remember being kinda pricey and it looks like they are constantly changing from all the different writing alterations on the board. A crappy building... fine, high prices...no big deal I can live with those minor set backs all I really care about is how the food tastes anyways. I shared  the biggest burrito they have with a co-worker, I have to say it was effin gross, I had about 3 bites and had to tap out due to my gag reflex. The chili is just watered down and has more spice than actual flavor, the meat is chunky and also lacks flavor. Maybe I prefer my Mexican food white boy style but If I want good Mexican food I'd rather go to King taco & Carambas. The Guy from Man Vs Food is a liar when he reviewed this place! LOL. This place however still has a lot of really good reviews so I still recommend to try it out for yourself and you be the judge. Disclaimer: Some of my more seasoned LA relatives have informed me there was another Manuel's in Lincoln Heights & it was closed down due to using horse meat in their food. Thats right Sea Biscuit was spending his final days rolled up in a damn tortilla.

Took the wife here today as we felt like Mexican food and ordered a Hollenbeck burrito, Beef Taquito and a half order of Guacamole with chips.  Burrito was just as good as I remembered and stuffed with tender pork but was a little too spicy for my wife so she stuck with her taquito which she loved.  I would recommend a 1/4 order of guacamole if there are only two people eating as the 1/2 was way too much and we had to take most of it home.  As we were leaving we saw Manuel in all of his pimpness spittin game to some honeys in front like the true Playa that he is.

first of all, i have tired the Manuel Special.  That burrito was huge!!! but it is very good.  I don't know what else to tell you but you should share with either one or two friends.  My boyfriend and I had shared the Manuel Special, and pretty much finished it.  It is quite filling and it will probably fill you down with all the rice and cheese and beans and beef in it.  It is soo good.  It cost about $20 just for that big burrito, but i believe it is well worth it once in awhile for a burrito that is delicious.

I learned about this restaurant from TV show Man vs. Food on the Food Network and wanted taste their food. So along with my husband and couple of friends we went there one Saturday afternoon. It was line outside the place and we had to wait about 45 minutes. We ordered Chili Colorado Burrito and Chili Verde Burrito (Regular size). It was the bomb. The regular size was huge enough for my husband and I to share. The place is smaller than I thought but staff were nice. The price was reasonable also. Needless to say we will visit here again.

I have been looking forward to eating here for a long time. Ever since I saw this on the Travel Channel I knew it was the place for me. We waited a while to get in because our party was very long. Our waitress wasn't pleased with us because two of our party were late. Which I understand sucks, but we tip well and she didn't appreciate her being so rude to us. She was very pushy, but we felt bad so we dealt with it. The burritos were just as big as everyone says but so delicious I have no words. Few of us in our group were able to consume our entire humungous burritos. We had an amazing dinner. One problem is, (besides the extremely pushy waitress) was that Ted ordered a burrito without beans and his came with beans. Oh well, he sort of ate around them. We would totally go back again (but with a smaller group to ensure quicker seating). Needless to say, it was amazing!!!!!!!

Wow if you want traditional Mexican food this place is it.  Crowded and small.  If you get there during lunch or dinner expect a wait.  Not good for big groups that is for sure.  The hollenbeck burrito is huge!  We had 4 people share one and there is even a larger one that feeds more.  Great food though, very fresh, don't feel like you just ate junk food like you do at the other Mexican places.  Try the rice water when you are there.

Growing up in East LA there is nothing better than a place with good food and makes you feel like you never left home. Manuel is so hilarious seating people, cracking jokes and having a good old time with his wife in the kitchen. While we were eating a song come on the speakers and he grabs his wife from the kitchen and starts dancing and didn't care who was or wasn't watching. The food is just a gargantuan plate of flavor. The Manuel special could feed about 5-6 people in my family and its perfect for sleepy Sundays when you just want to stay in and relax. The location is tiny and there are lines out the door if you don't get there early enough. Or else just go to the side window that provides a carryout option if you don't want to dine in. This is a quintessential LA spot that I Hope will never die out.

Dont remember how the food was, i think the pricing was more than its worth, the food was mediocre.  if you can't remember how the food tasted, that says a lot about the impression they made with the flavors.  i think the horchata was good though.  it's a place where you can judge for yourself b/c you can swing both ways at this hyped up place.  Service was good enough.  Been there, done that, moving onto another mexican restaurant......

No matter how hungry you are, you won't be able to finish your meal in one sitting. The food is served in hulk like proportions and you should expect to take some home or leave some there. Either way you will be content with your meal.

After several years of abstinence from "El", a friend invited me here and the food was much better than the last couple of visits.  The machaca was meaty and flavorful,  the flautas large and crunchy with the cooled homemade guacomole, the portions large, and the waitress was efficient and friendly!  If I got this all the time, I would bump them up to a 4, but the lack of consistency make them a 3.  The problem is that they seem to cook whatever they get--if it's old and stringy, feed 'em; if it's tender and flavorful, feed 'em--quality control needs to be better.

I have never been a big fan of Manuels. It always seems like their food is always lacking salt or flavor. I was there a week or so back. I had a overly priced carne asada burrito. It had no flavor what so ever. I think I am giving up on them. I have had many of the things on the menu and have never happy with it.

This place is amazing. Great food, decent prices, a city landmark and the place is literally world famous. I can honestly recommend anything on this menu to be great. I've seen some people post about Glorias in Downey, Ca. At best that place comes maybe at 60% to Manuel's Tepeyac. And of course their prices are cheaper, its cheaper quality food. All and all, hands down, Tepeyac is a great, authentic place to bring the family whether you're just sharing some taquitos with a friend for a light lunch, or bringing your family for some true mexican food feasting.

Went here with two others and waited 30 min to get a table.  It was well worth the weight.  We got our food very fast and everything was fresh and delicious. The guacamole is so fresh and green and thick! The mole and ranchera sauces are sooo good on all the burritos. Large Portions!!!!  Can't wait to go back

I love you, Manuel. He's so nice and friendly. We came as a party of 4 and had a party of 4. Manuel is very liberal with the tequila. The best part of the whole concept is that Manuel does not have alcohol on the menu. We came as a group of 4 to conquer the Manuel's special. We almost failed as a group of 4. Normally with quantity, the poor quality becomes evident but this is not the case here. It just means more tender and juicy pork stewed in a savory sauce, plowed on your plate, with a tortilla blanket containing the deliciousness. Ready to be eaten.

This by far has been my favorite in Boyle Heights, well in all of Los Angeles! They have the best guacamole, burritos, tacos and everything. My first visit here I was shocked at the size of the Manuel's special with hollenbeck. Sure its a hole in the wall and its no good for groups but you get to choose the outdoor or indoor dining with la chistas handing you the food. Service is top notch, people are friendly, and at the end you get a tub of candy. Its a real homey place and they don't charge too much money. You can go and walk away stuffed WITH leftovers. Best Mexican food place I've ever been to. Best LA dish I've had!

I got the Hollenbeck and it wasn't that spectacular; if you like burritos drenched in meat and sauce, then cool. It was huge, I couldn't finish it. I don't know what the hype is about.

I heard about this place and was in the area, so I stopped by. Had to stand in line outside for 30 mins to get in. It's a small ma and pa Mexican American place with room for just about 30 people inside. Food comes fast once you get in and everyone leaves with a box with their leftovers. Plenty of food. Burritos covered in red sauce and cheese. Monstrous portions leave you leaving good and the prices aren't that bad.

I have yet to stand in line at Manuel's (that's what it's known as in my family) so I can't say anything about the wait. All I know is that anytime we go visit my uncle's in East Los, there is at least 2 trays of the Manuel's Special on the table for everyone. And I wouldn't be surprised to hear "Hey I'll be back I'm going back to Manuel's to pick up another one."  I don't know what it is about the chile in these things that makes it so damn irresistible! The melted ooey gooey cheese, the cool guac and the hot-perfectly spiced-fall apart tender meat and the sauce on top, seriously, you can't deny it.

oh, el tepeyac - you are glorious. and you never, ever let me down. being that el tepeyac is around the corner and down the street from my grandma's house, i've been feasting on this stuff since i was a kid. whenever someone asks me where they can get good mexican food, i always suggest el tepeyac and say "it's not the same anywhere else." the manuel's special is GINORMOUS and absolutely delicious (so is the smaller hollenbeck). i suggest you get it with extra sauce as it makes it extra delicious - the meat gets more tender, it's more wet and just amazing. it's the perfect combination of rice, beans and yummy guac! speaking of the guac, it's the FRESHEST guac i've ever had. i love getting the taquitos here because of the fact that it comes with a heaping of guac, and it's sooooo delicious! i also love the hard tacos - the shell is pure crispy perfection, and the veggies and cheese in it are super fresh. the shredded beef in there is done to perfection as well. i also enjoy the chicken quesadillas. now that i live up north and far away from my beloved el tepeyac, i find myself having regular cravings of this stuff. and of course, i find that i must stop by every time i come home!

My friend treated a few of us to the Manuel special burrito that fed three men (all can hold their own when it comes to food) and me. He ordered taquitos as well, which comes with a generous amount of excellent guac, lettuce, and tomatoes. The burrito was the hugest I've ever seen, probably one of the best I've ever eaten, and came smothered with melted cheese, tomatoes, sauce, filled with rice, lots of meat, and yummy flavor! I enjoyed every bite. We got there around 1pm and for some reason, there was a long line on the inside, but not the outside. We found a table outside right away, and the weather was perfect to eat outdoors. The private lot is convenient.

Honestly, these people reviewing saying this place is good need to relax.  I was told the hollenbeck burrito or any burrito here in general is ginormous and delicious so i tried it.  And you know what, its a good size but you know why? It's all stuffed w/ rice and no meat.  I hate places like this.  Relax people.  I'd rather go thru El Taurino's nasty attitudes and get their taquito-sized burritos then get disappointed with a veggie burrito when I'm ordering a carne asada burrito.  Trek along folks.

Went for lunch today and got lucky, didn't have to wait to long. Manuel was working the velvet rope as usual. Super friendly nice guy that knows a lot of his customers. Had the Hollenbeck.... mmmm good, wasn't able to finish it so the extra came home with me. It was a girls birthday so they played a birthday song over the intercom while Manuel danced.

Long before the fad of Man vs Food, I grew up about 10 blocks in East LA.... It is common to hear in LA people from the Westside say the would never risk going to the Eastside, but they would go to "Manny's". To the locals it's "El Tepeyac'... Great food, but it also demonstrates the spirit of eas los ... Warm, small-town, genuine, no pretension, they don't care if your rich or poor, the latest Hollywood star or some working class slob from Sonora... Your all equal at El Tepeyac.  Now I live on the East Coast but still proudly wear my black Tepeyac T-Shirt. When some person asks me where us that I tell them with pride... Evergreen..East LA !!

You HAVE to eat here is you are within driving distance to LA. This is what being an Angelean is all about. Inexpensive, great tasting food in a sit down and eat atmosphere. FAMOUS FAMOUS FAMOUS not just because of the word, it's because of the food, and the amount of it. When you go not if you go, only order for one and two can eat it, believe me.

Largest and best tasting machaca burrito ever! So big, it is actually two meals for the very, very low price of one. This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in LA. It's perfect for friends and dates. Seating can be limited, and I have frequently seen long lines form outside to get a table. Try sitting at the counter, if you don't mind. It's family owned, so it looks and feels very mom-and-pop - super cozy.  El Tepeyac has been in LA for generations. My parents used to go on their first dates here. My dad remembers Manuel (the owner) serving everyone in the restaurant free shots of tequila. The food is the epitome of Los Angeles Mexican cuisine. Love it! Love it!

Completely agree with others about large portions, small flavor. (But not that huge). Got one of the burritos as takeout and took it home to eat with g/f and once we finished it, we were still hungry, mind you we were already really hungry. The buritto was way too generic and the salsa has almost tasteless. I don't think, i'll be going back there.

HUGE burritos. The burritos come with guacamole which is a rarity. Split the burritos if your not a huge eater otherwise you will have left overs for days. The place is pretty ghetto so maybe not the best place to go late at night. Just and FYI when the line is crazy long check out the order window to the left of the front door and you can eat outside, inside is nothing to miss.

It's a far drive, but worth a try. Remember - there IS a parking lot. So park there. We automatically looked for street parking, walked up the hill, and then found out there was a parking lot, FREE too. Very good information to have. The burritos are also HUGE, like MASSIVE. They're known for their 5lb burritos, which was on Man vs Food. It's a good size, so if you get one, you can share between 4 people at least. If you get a normal burrito, you can DEFINITELY split it between two people. The burritos are enormous and meaty, it's not the best burrito I've ever had, it's just more amazing to see the size of them.

I gave the place a four star because the burrito was good the service was fast however id like it if they were a little bit more sanitary. I brought the food to glendale and it was still hot. We enjoyed the burrito but couldnt get passed half of it. The food sat pretty nice not like other mexican restaurants. I will go back time to time to enjoy Manuels special burrito and then some.

The first time I came here, it was a hole in the wall, and it still is.  But the food is great and there's always a 20minute line, but worth waiting for.  The giant 6 pound Manuel's special is worth ordering, comes in pork, beef, or chicken and easily satisfies 4-6 adults.  If you don't want to wait in line, go to their side window and eat at the covered outdoor section. If you see an overly friendly short old man chatting it up, your seeing the one and only Manuel, who started the place 50 years ago.

I wanted to give this place more stars because my Dad loves it, but I just couldn't.   The pros: The portions are huge and the prices are good.  The nachos were the best thing that our big group ordered.   The cons:  The food is just bland.  Really lacks flavor.  I asked the waitress for some hot sauce and she never brought me any.  They charge extra for chips and salsa.   My husband went with the 5-lb. burrito.  He didn't finish it in one sitting.  I ordered the guacamole torta.  It was more like egg to go with the guacamole.  There was so much guac! Despite the lack of flavor, the leftovers actually tasted better cold! I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.   If I go back, I might be inclined to try the enchiladas or tacos.

But be forewarned its in the ghetto, as soon as we arrived off the of the free way a Ghetto Bird was in the air (Police Helicopter).

And it wasnt that expensive either only $30 for our large burrito and it fed four in half people no problem with a lot left over.

He makes this place as enjoyable as the beef enchiladas of which have the best  red sauce  that I have ever had, topped with graded cheese, they are truly delicious. The taquitos are topped with gobs of fresh guacamole! The classic Holenbeck is named after the local police station  ' no wonder the main ingredient is pork' This classic has however gone a bit skimpy on certain things but still a wonderful place.

breakfast was too bland, salt it up a little bit pops! to pricey for an Okie and some breakfast. The burrito is tons of beans, rice, sour cream, beef or other choice of meat, with a tortilla wrapping it, blanket style....not impressed, thanks for the $ to quantity ratio but i guess we compromise flavor.

If your hungry, and I'm not talking about, "Oh I din't have lunch today" hungry, I'm talking about "I'll seriously kill a cow with my bare hands" hungry, then get the Manuel's special. And do be a wuss and get the Hollenbeck. Seriously. Don't be a wuss. If I could have only one thing to eat for the rest of my life, it would be that.

Well, I finally got a chance to try El Tepeyac. After seeing it on Man V Food I thought it would be a good place to check out so I put it on my list. Well I was in L.A. last weekend so I thought I would check a few places off that list. I tried Phillipe's for lunch and El Tepeyac for dinner. And yes I was a bit to full to move after those two meals in the same day.     I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito which I was told is the "small" version of the Manuel's special. I have found that "small" is in the eye of the beholder. This thing was HUGE!!!  I was headed back to my hotel so I ordered it to go. When I got back I opened the clam shell to find that this thing filled the box completely from corner to corner. It had to weigh at least 3lbs. I started in and found it to be very good. The meat was tender and delicious. The green chile sauce was a very good compliment to the overall flavor. I will have to say that it did have a bit to much rice for me. It looks like that's how they make it so huge, Lots of rice filler. Over all I was pretty happy with my Burrito experience and would definitely go back for another round.

The first time I had El Tepeyac was at work.  When someone gets a promotion they would buy like 10 manny special burrito and feed like a 100 people.  Their tortilla chips are extra thick and crunchy.  It's an experience going to this place, I always gotten my food to go and called my orders in.  The Okie or a hollenbeck burrito is what I usually order.  The okie is exactly like the hollenbeck but with a red enchilada like sauce.  I've been coming back to this place when I have a big party and need to feed an army.  The regular burrito can definitely feed two.  If you are around the boyle heights and have time to kill, stop by El Tepeyac.

Alright so i think it was pumped up a bit too much by Adam (Man vs. Food) but i must say it was pretty good. I had a mixed Manuel's Special Burrito which is not on the menu, but thanks to the great service staff they hooked it up, the gigantic burrito was being placed on the table as i returned from the restroom and since i was starving this gets big props from me for fast service. It was two of us and we thought we could finish the Burrito, man we were wrong. El Tepeyac states that this Burrito feeds about 4, I know for a fact, it can "stuff" 4 people. so they get credit for the huge portions as well. People kept coming in non stop while i was there and everyone came in with a smile and ready to pig out, im sure..... The restaurant is small, but it seems to be kept very clean and the prices are more than fair. ($16.50 will stuff 4 adults with the Manuel's Burrito) I am definatelly looking forward to go back to try some of their other dishes.... by the way, we arrived around 3:30pm on a Thursday and walked right in and sat down... no waiting..

After watching Man Vs. Food, my aunt, uncle, mother and I decided to check out this place.  We got there around noon and were standing in line for an hour before we were seated.  The place inside was small but we ordered 4 tacos, 4 taquitos, manny's special burrito, a hollenbeck and an order of guacamole.  A lot of food and for the most part, excellent.  I would have given five stars had the pork were more tender but the food is good.  Tacos and taquitos were great, burritos were good, and guacamole was good.  Had I tried the Manny's special burrito challenge, I think I would have done pretty well but I will have to save it for next time.  Too many restaurants to try!!!!

this place has some HUGE!!!!!!! burritos! my lady took me the first time and we went with her aunt. the second time it was my bro and cousin and bro's friend that went with us. and it was the same result. So that is a big plus that this place is consistent so its delish every time you go. i got the oakie which was so big....i had some trouble later that night if you catch my drift. I was extremely satisfied with this food. the sauce was not to watery or too thick. The beef was tender, and the portion... insane! The price is great for what you get... a 2-3 pound burrito easily feeds two maybe three....in my case... just me...lol the wait is sometimes a hassle, but the line moves surprisingly fast. The inside is small which causes the line. The service is good, treat you like family is their main goal here and they succeed.

Came here with my gf after we saw it on TV. The Manuel Special is definitely one of the biggest burrito's we've ever had. It ended feeding my family of five. The inside seating was full and crowded so we just ordered outside; it took about 15 minutes. We ordered pork... it was okay. Probably should have tried the beef or chicken instead. Sure, I'd go back again.

When I attended CSULA and lived in the SGV I would often eat at Manuel's since 1968.  I hadn't been there for years as I migrated away.  However, the other day I was passing by the area and decided I had to stop by the best Mexican cafe I had ever eaten.  Over the last 42 years its menu has remained  the same.  The only difference I  noted over the years is a change in the machaca.  Now it is almost all meat with some onions, egg, and cheese.  Originally, it had more eggs, cheese,  green peppers, tomatoes, jalapenos and, I think garlic.  I don't know why you would change the original recipe which I preferred.  But it was still good but not as tasty and a blander version of what I remember.  The Hollenbeck  remains the same as I recalled it but with more pork and less guacamole, tomato, and was just not as good as the original.  Still, the food is better than any other Mexican I've found in my life. Returned to my favorite Mexican cafe and ordered the machaca dinner.  Manny must have seen my review because the machaca had some jalapeno although it was sliced very thin and there wasn't much but it gave the machaco some punch.  There were other adjustments back to how it was prepared as I remember it back to the 60's.  It was tastier than the last time but still not as much taste as I remember the original recipe.   http://www.youtube.com/w… I don't know why I go back to El Tepeyac since it is not as good as it was in the 70's.  I suppose it's for the nostalgia.  When we were in school, it was a reasonably priced local diner.  Sometime in the 80's they bought the house next door for a parking lot, doubled the prices and lowered the quality, if not the quantity.  I can't understand why I would pay eleven dollars for a burrito of five dollar, or lessor quality.  I know there are better burritos out there for half the price, such as, King Taco.  Manny's has been gouging his patrons based on the reputation of his early years.  I feel foolish since I am not paying for good food, but for memories. It's a lot like having a chili dog at Pink's for three dollars.  You could have the same thing at home for a fraction of the price.  People go to some places because they have somehow become monuments to ancient history. See http://www.burritophile.… for similar comments and reviews of burrito joints.

I think the Travel Channel/Man vs. Food, put this hole in the wall on the dining map. Of course once you get here, you have to order the 5 pound burrito. We were a party of 4 adults and 3 kids and we ordered 2-5 pound burritos and yummy they were. We still had leftovers for another meal. This place is small, so don't expect to get too comfortable in the restaurant. Manuel is great! He goes around talking to everyone. Expect to wait unless you order to go. Burritos were as good as you can get them. Take up the challenge and eat the 5 pound burrito by yourself!! I double dog dare ya!!

Love..... love love love.... what else can I say. We went on a sunday around 11am and wanted to sit inside. The wait to get a table did not even phase us since we had the best entertainment in the world- Manuel himself! We love this guy. He is so sweet, so funny, so knowledgable, and just a real joy to talk to. We just enjoyed how old school he is and how all of the big time stuff does not even phase him. He is great with kids and my son says that "he still has the moves". Once we got inside, we felt at home. The atmosphere was so wonderful, it reminded me of having a family party. My husband and I kept saying how much our family would love the place. The people are so friendly and a couple of the staff even bring shots around, even Manuel himself. Every item there tastes like heaven. My husband and son loved their menudo and I had to taste one of the world famous burritos. I am soooo glad I did. It was heaven, every bite was perfect. It reminded me of something my family would make, except HUGE and so much tastier (sorry family). I will also be enjoying it for lunch shortly. I also ordered the chips and guacamole, which was sooo fresh and sooo good. I also brought that back home and finished them last night and was still in heaven. My kids had cheese quesadillas and they were definitely authentic with cheese gooing everywhere. My husband also HAD to try the huevos rancheros and the bites I stole were amazing! For the food you get, the prices are so inexpensive. The experience was definitely worth more. As people leave Manuel like to shake hands with the guys and  give the ladies pecks on the cheek as well as handy out twinkies or ding dongs to the kids, as well as candy. This place is our new home away from home, any trip to LA is not complete without a stop to the El Tepeyac Cafe, the original one!

I love mexican food. Who doesn't? But there are tiers of mexican food out there such as high quality amazing , high quality crappy ,  crappy quality but amazing and crappy quality crappy food. I would say that  El tepeyac falls into the category of fair  quality and UH MAZING food. What a find. Setting: really low key, busy inside and busy outside. Im not saying this is Uhmazing food if you like Craft or AOC but it's good honest food. I like getting mine to go and picking up a bunch of El goya ginger beer, going home and gorging till I am in pseudo coma. This is not a place to go and dine. It is a pig out joint. My favorite!! Chili Relleno. Hands down. But i'm just that type of girl. I have had two burritos the hollenbeck, Everyone on here suggested it. It was good but I like more stuff in my burrito and not on it. The chunks of meat were delicious but I like a more fluid burrito. Every bite proportionate to the goodness. I was in search of the one that I had seen a girl order ( i was a dumbass and didn't go up and ask her... I still have no clue which one it was but i'm determined to find out) The next one I had was the oki chili verde. This one was really great. I would get it again if I wasn't now stuck on the relleno. When I am allowed back in the country I will be trying more and submitting some pictures! Till then I hope this  suffices to make you go here and try this place.

I found out about this place from an episode of Man vs Food where a ginormous burrito could be tackled. I tried to tackle it, but I hit my wall. I ate the whole burrito, but there were a lot of burrito guts leaving the burrito, so that didn't count. The service was great. Our server kept checking on us after we hit our walls. I guess she could see our struggle. There was a little line to come in, but we didn't wait that long. Manuel came out and greeted us; he gave us a little offering before seating us. He was a lot of fun.

We ordered the El Tepeyac special and when it came out we couldn't believe our eyes. We ate n ate and didn't even get through half of it. As far as the quality it was actually really tasty and made with love and not just to have a huge burrito to advertise.

Good but not great. Maybe I expected a little too much after reading such raving reviews, but I found El Tepeyac Cafe to be no more than satisfactory.  The first time I came here I tried the acclaimed "Hollenbeck" and was just short of disappointed. I thought I'd give the place another chance and returned a second time but came to the same conclusion: the portions are absolutely overwhelming and its mexican authenticity, questionable. Plainly, I didn't feel there was anything special about the place. Call me the antagonist, but I don't think it's worth the wait or the heartburn.

I love mexican food, and after seeing this place on Man vs. Food, I had to give it a try on a recent business trip to LA.   Left a little disappointed. Arrived at 11am for lunch and the place was packed.  Coworker and I took seats at the counter.  Promptly I was given a free shot of tequila as apparently the week we visited it was their 55th anniversay.  Things were looking good. Order some chips to start.  We were given a cup of green and red salsa for dipping.  Asked for second cup of the red salsa as we both like red.  I was told "no" and was a little surprised by the blunt response. Coworker ordered one of the pork burritos and said he pretty much didn't like it from the start.  I ordered the chicken burrito mainly because it listed just three ingredients - chicken, tomatoes an onion.  That is what I like!  But it came stuffed also with beans and rice - which I don't like.  All other burritos mention having refried beans but not this one.   Oh well. Portions were huge.  But overall the taste was just sort of bland.  Certainly an odd and interesting place, not only the location but also the staff.  But I wouldn't go back. Also, we looked at the window on the way out.  The health inspection rating was a B!  Tried to look online and see why they had a B rating but no luck finding the health report. I would say if you want to check out the hype, give it a try.  I don't think you'll be blown away by anything other then the portion size, but the rest is just OK, and the service seems like a bit of an inside joke.  Like if you don't know that they are rude, you'll be upset.  Sort of like the soup nazi on Seinfeld.

Best mexican food landmark in east los angles, the kind of food that sticks to your ribs and may require extra fiber to let it out.

Tacos, taquitos, enchiladas, salsa, chips, guacamole-everything is good in this joint, and it has the crowds to prove it. Don't be fooled by imitations- go to Manuel's Original on Evergreen.

The staff was very nice and friendly that's about as good as it gets. You're paying for the portion of the food not the quality... went there just today 07/13/10 it wasn't busy at all so there's no excuse for the poor quaility of food. I ordered the Okie Asada Burrito which says to allow 20 min for prep .. it came out in 5 min, it was not even temp hot.. it was cold.. and there was absolutely NO FLAVOR, there's no spice nothing! We even orded jalepenos just to add some kick and those weren't spicey at all. My friends also ordered different burritos and they had the same complaints. There's nothing authentic about the sauce I do believe its from a can. We also had the guacamole which was also horrible tasted old ... I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone.. i was so disappointed especially with all the hype that I heard.

So my husband and I saw all the reviews on our way back from Santa Barbara one weekend and decided to check the place out. It's definitley an experience.  My husband got a burrito and it was HUGE! I had rolled tacos (guacamole was excellent).  Food was good mexican...nothing gourmet but definitley hit the spot.  We had to wait in line outside to get in but Manuel came out to entertain and deliver tequila and beer to those waiting.  We were seated in 10 min or so.  Service was good.  They bring around a basket full of candy at the end for you to pick from.  Probably won't go back since we live in San Diego but recommend it to try.

I am not a newbie to Tepeyacs's food. I was born and raised in neighboring Echo Park;but only came to know the famous "Manuel's Special" while hanging out with my buddies from Salesian High School during the '80s. And now that I work in Boyle Heights, I have had the great pleasure of reacquanting myself with the tried and true deliciousness of Manuel's food. I was fortunate to run into Manny, the famous and beloved owner of Tepeyac, this morning. He greeted me as if I was an old family member and was truly gracious and funny. He claims that the reason he has been so prosperous is that he lives each moment to the fullest and is happy to share his food. That being said, I -along with my coworkers received a bounty of goodness from him:  a footlong Machaca burrito, several plates of taquitos (with shredded beef) and authentic guacamole, the Hollenbeck burrito, fresh tortillas chips and of course, their red hot salsa and the milder salsa. We were overwhelmed with his generosity. Besides the food being always delicious and very fresh, the owner Manny is a true gem!

There is a reason that there's always a line down the block!  This place is a Boyle Heights classic for its' huge burritos.  My favorite is the machaca with red sauce and cheese on top, but be sure to share!  The only downside is their guacamole, which varies in freshness.

I have enjoyed El Tepeyac for 35 years. I now live out of State but when I am in town I always stop in a few times. I would and should give El Tepeyac 5 stars but they don't have Lengua or cabesa. Manuel is a rock star and still slinging Tequila to a few lucky customers :-) Food can be magical when it fills our stomach with nutrition and memories.

One of my all time favorites.  I love this place and look forward to every visit.  The owner Manuel Rojas is a good guy who enjoys interacting with his customers.  If he likes you, he might even offer you a drink ; )  The food is consistently good.  You definetly need to try the famous Hollenback Burrito, which is their claim to fame.  I'm a fan of their home made Menudo and Huevos Rancheros.  I enjoy these three dishes so much and rarely deviate to other menu options.  FINAL VERDICT: Food 5/5 comfort food, Ambiance 4/5 old school diner, Service 4/5 if you run into Manuel and it's not too busy, he'll treat you well.  Be careful though, he might try to sneek in to hug and kiss your lady.

I tried this place and it sucks. If you like canned food... You'll love it here. There beans taste like rosarita refried beans and there food got me sick all three times I visited. This place doesnt customize any order, its as is on menu. I know a taco truck down the street that has better quality everything.... GROSS.... sad that people like this place and identify with it as being a good spot in La. If this is good, then I feel bad for east los....

Client took us here for lunch to try the famous burritos.  The history and press are why this place has such high ratings.  The hollenback burrito was huge, but dry and not impressive.  Overall, not worth the wait, marginal food.  It is an experience everyone should do and cross off your "bucket list" when in the area.

Growing up in East LA, I've been coming here since high school when we used to have half days.  There are lot of good choices for Mexican food, but no one beats El Tepeyac. The Hollenbeck is still my favorite.  I still haven't found a restaurant with better chile verde. Prices are a little on the steep side but still worth it. Now living on the westside, I'm willing to drive across town to enjoy a big lunch.

Good good Mexican! LA landmark for sure! Burritos are big & flavorful, can't go wrong with chicken tacos & guacamole. A lil pricey  but a must visit in the heart of East LA.  Plus you can pick up a new leather belt an wallet... Do it buddy , do it!

I went to El Tepeyac this past Saturday because I saw them on "Man vs. Food" I think trusting a television program where the host was given free food was my first mistake.  That being said...   The first problem was that we waited out side while they allowed people that came after us to jump in front of our party.  I'm not saying it's because we were the wrong ethnicity (black), but we were definitely the only individuals there that had no south of the border backgrounds. Secondly, there were flying ants flying around inside of the restaurant.  Were repeatedly had to ask for new water because they were constantly flying inside of our glasses, not to mention in to our food.  I don't like eating insects but it took everything in my being to stay and complete the meal.  Looking back at the situation I should have complained in a loud voice and stormed out. Third, the place was FREEZING!!!  I understand that if the restaurant is cold then people won't want to stay and chit chat so they can get more people in, but seriously.  Because it was so cold the food quickly froze. Fourth and finally, you better know "Español" after asking for fresh water numerous times the waiter finally understood what we were trying to tell him about the insect in the water and reluctantly gave us another glass (or just poured out the water and refilled it). Never again will I let a food television program lie to me and make me believe that they found some gem in the rough.  If I haven't heard of it it must be rough, and doesn't deserve my patronage. You have been warned...go at your own risk.

I came here with a group of friends to watch them try to conquer the Manuel's Special.  (None of them got further than almost halfway.)  While we waited outside for a table, Manuel came out to greet us and tell us the history of his little restaurant.  He was very sweet and definitely took a liking to one of the girls in our group, haha!  I ordered the Hollenbeck burrito with chicken (in hindsight, I probably should have went with carne- the chicken was a little dry and not very flavorful).  The burrito was big enough to justify the 9 bucks I paid for it, and overall it was satisfying.  Oh, and for some reason the horchata was really, really good- but maybe I was just thirsty from waiting 30 minutes in the sun for a table!

Manny was a little aggressive when I first came here. One of the waitresses had to calm him down! Other than that, the food was delicious! You really get your moneys worth here. I underestimated the size of that burrito! There is a bit of a wait to enter, but if you LOVE Mexican food, then it's totally worth it. Oh, and if super crowded restaurants aren't your thing, I'd suggest to order to-go. I will definitely be back, crowded or not!

After watching Man v. Food, I though I found a good restaurant, that I otherwise would have never visited. The food really is not that good, it smells and tastes bad. I ordered the burrito. My friend ordered the fish tacos, which were deep fried frozen fillets, god knows how old. When we complained about them, they suggested the beef tacos, which were plain nasty. Mystery meat meets oily hard shell taco. The service sucked, rude waitresses. They made me feel bad for correcting their mistakes. I love Mexican food, the champ is KING TACO, coming in second is EL CHOLO, and not third is Taurinos. El Tepeyac was a bad experience.

Not bad, but not the Holy Grail of Mexican food. Yes, the food is plentiful, but what good is that if it's not over-the-top delicious? Even though I lived in Mexico, I'm not such a stickler for authenticity that I'll take a good place out of the running just because it uses cheddar cheese. Tastiness is king. Unfortunately, El Tepeyac doesn't take me there. I found the comments about the place so passionate though, that I did decide the restaurant merits a blog post: http://cruzandocaliforni…

El Tempeyac is big on size and small on taste. I just got back from El Tempeyac and it motivated me so much to sign up for yelp and write my first review. Like many of you I saw this on 'Man vs. Food' and from the reviews below my friend and I decided to make the trip since it was close to work. To it's credit, the place definitely has a local authentic feel. We went around 12pm on a weekday and it was packed but were able to find a seat immediately. The waitresses were nice but I thought it was funny how one of them used the soda fountain to wash her hands! El Tempeyac exemplifies what is wrong with Los Angeles Mexican cuisine like Tito's Tacos: It's all about a gimmick and not about taste. We ordered the Hollenbeck burrito which is a smaller-sized version of the 6 lb special. Sure it was huge, but it tasted bland. The asada was just chopped up steak and the ranchera sauce was just watered down. Do yourself a favor if you intend to visit the area for mexican food go to King Taco (or El Taurino) around the corner instead. The quality of the food is better but if you just want to take a picture of a big burrito and send it to friends on facebook, then El Tempeyac is the place to go. However, if you are fixated on getting incredible mexican food and are willing to travel, take a trip to San Diego and order a California Burrito from Lolita's Taco Shop. You will not regret this: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…

So my bf and I finally tried this place too see what all the fuss is about and seriously with all honesty, I didn't see anything special about the place. Granted that the size of the burritos are overwhelming but that's about it! There's a line to get into the place (which I got all hyped up about because I was thinking, wow this place is going to be really awesome). The place is small and you literally have to bump elbows while you eat. The service is okay ( servers kept passing by in front of us and we were sitting at the counter too before someone finally took our order). Food was mediocre (I found a bone in my Okie de pollo burrito (gross). Overall, I've had way better food than this.

Been going here for over 30 years. This is a LA must. It is a love hate relationship with good ol Manuels. I've been going there with my family for over 30 years. The food is the best Mexican-American food out there. I say Mex-American because of the choices of cheese and portions they offer. You go to Manny's for the food, not the ambiance and part of the city. They have not changed the decor and  the wait staff since I've been going there.  I would suggest Manny's for a late breakfast, you will probably not finish the plate and will likely not be hungry for the rest of the day or week! I thoroughly enjoy and can't seem to order anything else but 1. Machaca dinner (or burritto), 2. IIuevos Rancheros or 3. Enchiladas Rancheras.  I seldom order anything else because those are the definite best plates. That is why I love this place, why I might hate it a little is that it is this insane quantity of food that makes it so unhealthy. Do your self a favor and order a dish amongst friends and share.

This is THE best mexican food restaurant i have EVER been to. And let me tell you...I am Mexican and this stuff is ultimately authentic (I eat Mexican food everyday) The best burritos is the hollenbeck with red salsa, personally. One of the waitress' have been working there for as long as I can remember. I have been eating here for ten years now and never have I come across another mexican food that compares to this delicious food. You also get everything worth your money.

When I used to work at Cal State L.A., we would go here at least once a month - we would have gone more often but the portions are HUGE so we braced ourselves and limited our visits to once a month... Warning, the line can be quite long when it's prime lunch or dinner time, but it's worth the wait. The dining area is very small, so it gets filled up quickly. I've tried several things on their menu - the taquitos, the burritos... one of my faves is the machaca burrito- so delicious! Their guacamole should not be passed up either. The owner actually greeted us during a long line one day and offered us shots of tequila on the house as a thank you for waiting so long! This is definitely one of my favorite holes in the wall in L.A.

Love this place. I have been going here forever, but some asshole hit my car. No common courtesy to come in and mention it either. It's not like you can't walk in and tell the workers that you hit someones car.  I know crap happens, but take responsibility for your actions. Instead I walk out and see the left side of the bumper cracked and completely pressed in with the paint rubbed off and paint from the other car on it. I knew I should have parked outside on the street. The bright side of this I had amazing food and know karma is coming for this person.

From a homeboy who grew up down the street from Manuel's, I have to give it 5 stars.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  Why do you think there is always a line out the door?  Of course the Manuel's Special, and small version, Hollenbeck are the bomb.  Other personal favorites are the Machaca Dinner and Taquito Dinner.  If you're lucky to get a seat inside, you're even luckier if Manuel himself offers you a shot of tequilla.  I've been going all my life and been offered a shot only twice.

Came here after watching man vs. food... It was a really cold day so waiting outside in line sucked, and it took about 20 minutes for us to get seated. As my boyfriend and I were deciding on what to order, the table next to us was just getting our food. I saw this enormous burrito pass by me, covered in melted cheese and sauce. I knew i had to get that one! Turned out it was a Hollenbeck De Asada, which we decided to split. Also ordered horchata, which was HUGE. The burrito was amazing! The meat was tender and the red sauce on top had just the right amount of spiciness. I actually couldn't finish my half..that's how big their burritos are! Service was great. They were really good at recommending stuff on the menu and worked really quickly to make me forget about the cold, long wait outside. The location isn't the greatest but the food definitely makes up for that. I would definitely come back if i'm ever in the area :)

For Mexican food its authentic! It took me too long to finally make it over to this place. I love Mexican food and it was awesome to find a place that knows how to make it right. There was a line and we waited about 20 minutes. A couple behind us cut in front of us which made me mad. The owner Manuel looked friendly but he did not engage us in conversation, you could tell he was there to favor his returning clients. Once we were seated the table was small but it was enough for the three of us. The small location was full of movement as orders were taken, people were talking, and food was being delivered. I ordered the Veggie Burrito with the guacamole on the side, it has rice, beans, cheese, and is topped with ranchera sauce. The rice was nothing special, the beans were very tasty, the cheese was gooey, and the sauce was spicy enough to enjoy. Overall it was a good burrito. Its similar to one I can get near my home in Bellflower. The guacamole I ordered on the side because most of the time it has raw onion, which this one does. I took a small amount of it and bit straight into one, which nearly ruined the meal for me. I also was able to try a chicken burrito which was very wet and it made it unpleasant. I think this place is good but i can get good Mexican food near home, specially a bean and cheese burrito. I would probably not go back just because there is a line, the place is small, and its further away from home. I'll stick to real Mexican food at home.

The place is really old school even has the juke box in the corner with the oldies holmes!! Not to much room for big groups but they will accommodate. Definitely take tizzies before this place... huge portions and you gotta have an appetite. A word of advice, if you order the enchilada sauce on your burrito or anything for that matter check and see if you need to clean your face, chin, hands, even your forehead, everything before leaving... that shit will stain your skin an orange color and you will look like a fool walking out saying thank you with an orange mouth and chin.

At first bite I fell in love with the "Burrito de Machaca." I've never in my life felt a burrito taste so good. It wasn't at all too complicated but it still had a very good kick to it. The salsa is fresh the way it should be. The small enviroment makes it feel more home-like. The workers are nice but wondered why they wouldn't talk to me in spanish. Fresh "aguas" and worth the extra dollar. This is a good place to bring a gf/bf when you only have $20 and starving. =].. Order the "Burrito de Machaca," its melted just right everytime.

This place is by far " The greatest mexican food in California!" I only wish there was a place like this in the inland empire. While visiting the restuarant i was honored to meet the owner manny. very friendly guy. What people dont realize is that this place has been around for year... It looks like it was built from someones home. People are so used to going to chain restuarants (like chipotle) where every thing is spick and span. Screw that. keep it original, dont change anything. If you dont like the restrooms, piss before or after you go to the restuarant.

Excellent Mexican restaurant in L.A. a bit tough to find on my first visit because they hide themselves to new comers.  Because of Man v. Food.  My friend and I tried the Manuel Special with carne asada as the choice of meat.  So it came out to be a 5 pound burrito, covered in sauce and cheese (Hollenbeck).  A table next to us with 6 people ordered two manuel special like we did, and stared at us with awe.... I would say this it was the best burrito I've ever had up to today, they certain one up Pepe's in Alhambra.  The sauce was very flavorful but not salty or heavy at all, but the cheese on top, they can do without, I love cheese so that didn't bother me.  Inside the burrito was a perfect melody of carne Asada, beans, rice, a lot of guc, and cheese.  After we successfully finished the Manuel Special, the store manger at the moment gave us t shirts, and even took one burrito off our bill, SO we paid for only one Manuel Special =D I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. -Out of Five- Revisit Value - 5 Taste- 4 Satisfaction-4

I decided to go here after reading the numerous positive reviews on Yelp and seeing the pictures of the monster sized burritos (can they even be called  burritos, more like burros).  I went here with my friend Daniel after class to check it out. To start off with, I really liked the look of the restaurant as it gave off the feel of an older established place that has a long history.  The photos of Manuel and patrons that have visited was a really nice touch.  A very clean restaurant and the service was very friendly.  I had expected there to be a line but surprisingly there was none and the inside was maybe about half full. Prices were pretty decent, a bit higher than I see at some of the other Mexican places I usually go to; but this is offset by the huge portions they give you.  I especially liked the jumbo sized aguas frescas they offer--Daniel had a horchata while I opted for a jamaica. We ordered a Manuel's Special with chicken as the carne asada wasn't available.  When it arrived, we hadn't really expected it to be as large as it was.  Alas, we were met with disappointment as the burrito was really rather bland.  The only part of it that had a strong flavor was the whole clove of garlic that I found mixed in to it.  The included salsa wasn't all that bad either, I got the mild and Daniel got the hot (his salsa tasted pretty bland too though).  Maybe it was just an off day or something. In conclusion, our visit to El Tepeyac was okay--not something I'd write home about or some place I'll probably go out of my way to go to.  The burritos are nice if you're looking for something to fill the hole in your belly or have a large party (not too large as the seating is fairly limited) who aren't expecting anything fancy; but I've had burritos that tasted far better than what I got.

After seeing this on Man vs. Food, i had to try it. We finally had a chance to go there yesterday. It was totally awesome. My daughter and son-in-law had the hollenback burritos (they were huge) and i had the koko special (beef enchiladas with eggs of easy). The food was great, the service was great, the people were fun and friendly. Manuel is so funny. He's a wonderful man. Everyone needs to go here. Warning, it's a small cafe. If you get there at peak hours, you will wait in line. But the service is fast and you won't wait long. Enjoy.

This is my favorite Mexican Food on the planet! I've been eating at "Manuel's" since I was a kid. That's over 30 years of consistently good food! The Hollenbeck Burrito is my favorite, my wife gets the Taquitos and we always get a half order of guacamole (which feeds 2-3 people). I've only dined inside a handful of times, I always opt for ordering and sitting outside to avoid the wait. Definitely worth trying if you enjoy authentic Mexican food.

I've been coming here since I was a little kid, I absolutely love this place, for me this place holds a lot of good memories. The food is great!, good tasting and comes in great portions! you will never leave this place hungry most likely you'll leave with left overs, unless your up to the challenge of eating all the food on your plate (which i have only done here once in my life). The Okie burrito and the chilaqueles are my favorite here, you can't go wrong.

The line is ridiculous every time that I have been there.  Weird since there are places to get good mexican on every corner, alley and sidewalk in East LA.  Been three times, and never wanted to sit inside, not worth it.  Just order at the counter and eat outside.  Got a machaca tostada which was pretty massive, full of meat and avocado and was a pretty good choice.  Enough by itself and Tepeyac is the only place I have ever seen a machaca tostada, though I am sure you could order one at many places.  I also got the Hollenbeck special burrito with asada and beside for being enormous, it was only so-so as far as burritos are concerned.  I still have yet to order a machaca burrito but think it is a better suited meat for this restaurant, I think machaca may be Manuel's specialty.  If you are with a group of three or 4 people or you are one really, really hungry person, I would suggest trying to knock out the Manuel special.  Biggest burrito I have ever seen in person.  Still a good place to eat, but come for the atmosphere so that way you aren't disappointed by the line.

If you are low on funds and have a pention for Mexican moonshine drop into Manuel's El Tepeyac.  Upon entry into the establishment you will be greeted by this troll of a man.  Don't be disturbed he isn't a panhandler or the janitor. In fact he is East LA's very own mystical burrito elf! Yes, Manuel has been greeting patrons for years but for a very few of us we not only get a hand shake but we also get a fist full of tequilla! Que bueno is right.  One way I get a cheap high is to enter Manuel's and receive my first shot. Than I sit at the counter and review the menu over free water, salsa and chips.  After a basket of chips, I excuse myself, and walk out of the building. When I return I'm wearing a hat, and Manuel gives me another shot.  Than I repeat the process.  Next I walk in with a sombrero and a mustache and the fun really starts. You may have to bring many disguises along with you depending on your tolerance, but it is well worth the planning.  So don't delay get on over to El Tepeyac and get your drink on.  Why not its free!

Wow.. that pretty much sums it up. We checked it out because I saw it on MvF. Definitely worth waiting 20 min in the rain. My wife and I both got a burrito. I got the Okie which is the "small" version of the Manuel's and my wife got the Machaca then we shared a 1/2 order or guac. It was sooo much food and soo good! The guac was very fresh and tasty, but way too much. We should have got the 1/4 order. Both of our burritos were awesome but way too much food. It is literally enough for 3 meals. My only complaints are that the home made chips very pretty greasy as if the oil wasn't hot enough and they only offer one refill with your soda.

El Tepeyac is my favorite Mexican restaurant in L.A. Now it is not the fanciest place or the most authentic food so don't go there looking for something like La Serenata de Garibaldi, Border Grill, Monte Alban or Guelaguetza because there are no white linens on the tables and there are no moles on the menu. It is simply amazingly tasty Mexican food in large (or sometimes huge) portions, covered with tons of cheese and sauce and guacamole, served up by a very friendly family. This is an old-school East L.A. locals place that is worth getting to know. I thought it was a little on the expensive side when I went there for the first time and ordered some taquitos from the window for around $5 and a burrito for over $8. I changed my mind when I got the order and realized the taquitos were covered in about half a pound of guacamole made from fresh avocados that would cost $6 to $8 in most other restaurants all by itself and the burrito was filled with meat and big enough to feed four people. There can be a line for both the restaurant and the take-out window whether at night or on the weekends but they usually seem to move fast and if you are by yourself, there is often an open seat at the counter. Bring your cash and your appetite because El Tepeyac is popular for good reason.

We ordered the Manuel's Special, carne asada. It was huggge, but the taste wasn't very authentic. It was a fun experience, but the place was cramped and sort of Americanized. I went because I saw the place on Man V Food. I'm very picky about Mexican food. I don't think I'll go back.

This restaurant is majorly over rated. It is a perfect example of a home favorite who got to popular for its own good. They were on the travel channel and the food network and I went back after seeing them on T.V. to go and reminisce on an old favorite.  But I was so disappointed with the quality of the food it was flavorless and I had better food at taco bell who doesn't even use real beef. Manuel needs to go back in the kitchen and do some quality control on his product. I feel like instead having people return because of the food he is now putting his faith on his customer's loyalty and his television appearances. So don't think I am some rookie either because I have been coming to this spot with friends and family all my life and slowly they have been getting worse till I stop going all together. But try it out because it might be your taste in food because people on TV sure act like they like it.

I came here several weeks ago in a group of about six guys and four girls.  Due to the four girls being with us (all Korean), Manuel came over and started chatting up a storm. Old school macking at it's finest.  Very nice guy, with the most hilarious voice I have ever heard in person.  We were seated promptly and though it wasn't crowded at first, tables started filling up quickly.  Everyone ordered different burritos, four of the guys shared a Manuel special.  I ordered some chicken burrito with verde sauce.  Looking at back, I realized I should have probably ordered pork, but oh well.  Seriously, what is the hype associated with this place besides it's heritage, being on Man vs. Food, and the portions?  I don't think this burrito was even on par with what they serve at Green Burrito.  Most bland tasting burrito I've ever had in my life, and this includes those burritos at 7-11 that you microwave.  I was very unimpressed with my burrito, tried several others, and came to the same conclusion. The value can't really be beat as thing was as big as a baby's arm, but for people who actually enjoy good tasting food, I would recommend that they continue their search.

I like this place. It has nice homey feeling to it. Maybe it's because the place is tiny or our server was really nice. Anyways, If you want to get a full stomach without breaking the bank, this place will hit the spot. The servings were huge and it was only $10 a person depends on what you order. My group shared the food so it was hard to distinguish what was what after. But I can say that the meat to pick is the carne asada which was really good. Based on what I ate, the food was good but it lacked freshness. Overall, a nice place for some good Mexican food. Good portions at a good price. Exactly what I am.

So good I almost had my stomach pumped(How/Why if the foods so good-Cuz I ate a Manuel's Special on my own that's how and I'm a little Asian dude with a big appetite thats how) The Manuel is a SERIOUSLY sloppy burrito with all the shredded pork,beans and rice that'll have you at first smell;the best burrito in L.A bar none and well enough for four good size appetites.(although the best Mexican food has to still go to the sublime La Serenata de Garibaldi) The Hollenbeck is a good bet for a solo diner with an appetite and the Machaca isnt a bad choice either.

I started going to this place in the late 60's, and have gone there pretty regularly until a few years ago...it was always great, loads of tasty food at a decent price, definite 4 star material...the last two times the place looks the same as ever, but the food has gone waaaay downhill...my favorite was the freshly made machaca dinner, even for breakfast...these last times the food was not fresh, the machaca burnt on one side (I mean black and sticky, ugh!), and even after slathering the only medium tasting salsa on, it was bland and tasteless...its not just my taste buds are fading with age, my friends all found the food unacceptably boring and just not worth the trip to the barrio any more. Unfortunately Manuel (who is still tottering around) has let the place go foodwise....an example of universal entropy? Anyway, I have regretfully stricken this once outstanding restaurant from my favorite's list.

Went there for the first time last week! Small,little restaurant with a sit down bar.Came there around 1:30 in the afternoon and it wasn't crowded, so we got seated right away. Looked at the menus, but we knew what we were there for already. I wanted to try to eat that Manuel's Special Burrito! Wasn't sure how big it was 'til they brought one out for a family of 5 to share. Kinda looked doable at that point. I started getting excited about getting mine, so we ordered it, along with a taco apiece as our feast. Cameras came out of nowhere and everyone was taking pictures of the next tables' burrito. I swear not 5 minutes later, out came our dinner. I marvelled at the sped at which I got my food! So, there it is in front of me, so, naturally, I gotta break out my camera to record this mega event. It was huge and covered with more pork and cheese sauce. Looked like a postcard! Then, the tacos were the hard shell type stuffed with real steak, lettuce, and cheese like you wouldn't believe! Picture time again! Wow, we thought as we studied the humongous pile of guacamole there! Never got that much anywhere ever before! As I picked up the burrito plate to test the weight of that thing, I immediately knew there was no freaking way I was gonna be able to do it! The waitress, Little Mary,  who was all of four feet something, said it's 5 1/2 lbs. It felt like 8 to me! And the separate guoc was like 1/2 lb. too. Got a couple kinds of salsas and was ready to dig in. The taco was incredible, one of the best I've ever had! By the time we finished eating all we could, there was more than half a burrito left and figured my daughter at home might want some! Our fantastic and caring waitress packaged everything up and it STILL was really heavy! Man! It was so reasonable price-wise too-only $30 and change! I was so happy with the experience I gave Mary a $10 tip! She was a sweetheart, and we thoroughly enjoyed everything! Can't wait to come back and try something else! Outrageously recommended by me, you gotta check this out!

I went last nite and the food was very good.  Like most critics have said, its not the best of the best when it comes to taste, but its still very good.  However, the service that me and my friends were given was the best and is what will keep us going back :)  Me and 3 other friends went, and all of us liked our food except my friend.  She didnt like the pork much.  She wanted the burrito i was having.  She felt bad so she didnt want to ask and have her order changed...but i insisted and had the waitress bring her what i was having.  The waitress mentioned that unfortunately it would still be charged to our tab, but that she would see what she could do about it.  At the end, she was able to remove the charge for the unwanted meal, and she still gave it to us in a box to maybe give it away when we left.  The waitress was very hospitable, and had the best customer service ever!.  We hope she is there when we go back :)

The food is okay, but not great. Not to mention the long lines. El Tepeyac is located in the heart of Boyle Heights where is has been for the past 50 plus years. It has become very popular over the years so that only means that the quality of the food also goes down. It became even more popular as it was featured on an episode of Man Vs. Food. I remember as a kid that the food was delicious, but now the food is nothing out of the ordinary. Last time that I went, the lines were ridiculously long! People of different parts of Los Angeles come to eat at this restaurant. The menu has grown over the years and now features other popular Mexican items. Tried the chile verde burrito as well as the carne asada burrito. The burritos were really expensive, so I was expecting something big and delicious. The burritos were big, but not as big as I imagines. I wasn't trying to compare them to the Manuel Special burritos, but I was expecting them to be bigger than most burritos. The chile verde burrito was really sloppy, not in a good way. There was more watered down beans in the burrito than the carne con chile verde. The carne asada burrito was pretty dry. I really regret not going to smaller hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant near by that is not over rated. I don't think that I will be going back to El Tepeyac.

Finally ...  Finally, after all these years ... Finally, I know exactly what my future baby will look like when I dress him up as a burrito for Halloween.  What am I talking about? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!!!??  ...  Because I'm talking about the ginormous, mouth-watering burritos being served up at Manuel's El Tepeyac.  Thanks to our GRUB buddy Steven A, it was one of the first GRUB-suggestions we got back in the day when we started up this crazy journey ... and after Jim R. gave us some more encouragement towards the mayhem-of-Mexico ... the time for a GRUB-revolution was finally upon us.  This hole-in-the-wall over in East LA is definitely a local institution ... packed on a Sunday night, we patiently waited  with enthusiasm in a line outside ... for the opportunity to dine on the soon-to-be-yum being devoured inside.  We started out with an order of their cool-n-creamy guacamole and layered it on a basket of their deliciously-super-fried-and-crunchy chips.  They're those deep-fried, not-from-a-bag, I'm-a-little-nervous-they're-actually-a-trap chips that make my knees weak and my belly strong.  To go along with the guacamole, they served up a couple dishes of homemade salsa ... one a tangy verde and the other a fire-breathing roja ... both amazing ... and both just prepping our taste-buds for the monster lurking around the corner.  We all knew of Manuel's reputation.  We thought we were prepared.  After all, there were three of us ready to battle the beast ... and a battle it truly was.  As we gazed at the menu, our first challenge was to pick between the several varieties of the Manuel's Special ... ranging from carne aside to machaca, or seasoned ground beef, to our ultimate pick ... chile verde.  The burrito is not only huge ... it's damn tasty.  Loaded up with tender chunks of pork, bathed in a green chile sauce, paired up with rice and beans, all topped with a healthy layer of salsa and shredded cheese.  All the ingredients melted together as we ate and each bite brought a giant smile to our faces.  We did our best, and only took down about two-thirds of the baby-sized burrito ... nothing to be ashamed of.  It wasn't until after we finished that we noticed the free shirt you'd get if you finish it all by yourself.   So with the GRUB-nation as my witness ... I will be back.  The gauntlet has been thrown down ... the challenge made ... a war will be waged, and we will rise victoriously through the GRUB.  And screw it, even if we don't ... it'll be amazing.  Because that's the sort of place Manuel's is ... the giant burrito is no gimmick ... they've just got the goods ... and lucky for us ... they've got a lot of it.

I love this place, and emotionally would give it five stars; it is and will always be a favorite. Manuel has no peer among restaurant  owners--he makes everyone feel like one of the family. The food is really good and actually kind of unique. The Hollenbeck burrito is king. The guacamole is some of the best. I have had better Mexican food, but rarely a better experience. I prefer slightly dryer Mexican food; El Tepeyac  stuff can be pretty wet. You will eat with a fork, I promise you; nothing will hold together in your hand. The taste is very good, The prices are justified by portions alone. The rellanos are ordinary; the beans are good. They are not terribly generous with cheese. But if you like Chile Verde and Chile Colorado and Guacamole and big portions of much better than average food, it is great. I like the food, and love the atmosphere because I have a lot of fond memories of the place, and you just feel good supporting a business like this. EVERYONE should eat here once. A five star could be justified, but I want to be really honest--VERY GOOD, not great.

One of our pastors at church got the $31 burrito from this place for our friend's birthday. I think it was the party size of the Manuel's Special. It was so good! We had enough to serve a party of 15, and we had some left. It was so delicious. It was hot and fresh, and it was filled with flavor. It' was absolutely fantastic. Definitely want to try it some other time when I actually go there.

I agree with Roxanne G.  I've known about this place since 1971, and I've only eaten there a few times, that last time was about Dec. of 2000.  The burritos are big, too big to finish and most of the food is overpriced.  I don't think it's worth the wait and I also don't like crowded little restaurant's.  To me it's all about the taste and although it taste good, it's not worth the wait, the price and the uncomfortable seating.  I stop going here a long time ago ever since I discovered Ciro's restaurant one block south.   I think a lot of people who like this place have not ventured out of Boyle Heights too much.  There are other places that are tastier, don't over charge and are more comfortable. The one thing I will credit them with is that they do serve a lot of food.

I must review this dump once again... as I've said before. I've been coming to this place since I was a kid as many of you home grown east LA'ers have been proclaiming. So I gave it yet ANOTHER try last week just to please my bf (mind you, the last time we came he was dissapointed... I was so excited). He decided to give it another try to redeme itself. So we hit the spot on a Friday night, not as crowded as usual.. hmmm.. a sign that others have realized what I have?? So we have a seat and I decide to have the Kikos Special w/ enchilada sauce. The Kikos Special is 2 enchiladas w/ meat or cheese (I had cheese) rice and beans, what makes this special is they put a fried egg on top. Nothing new to me, we'd have enchilada left overs w/ eggs for breakfast as a kid. So I take a few bites of everything on my plate and am once again NOT IMPRESSED. NO FLAVOR, flavorLESS. The enchilada sauce was so bland, there was oil flowing all over my plate. Rice was dry as can be, beans tasted like mush. Do they need me to go back there and give them a hand??? Oh and to top it off, the complementary chip that came along standing in my beans tasted like it had been fried in dirty old oil. So I remained mum about how I felt about my meal in order to not spiol my guys small feast. He had a Hollenbeck of course. So when we got to the car I turn to him and said "so how was it?" he replies "I dont think I ever want to go back" oh lord jesus I screamed I was so happy!!! Over joyed and extatic that he had finally matured his taste buds to mine and realized that it has gone down the drain, all the way to the sewer. He was sad that something he had loved so very long (since childhood as well) was no longer on his top 3 resturant list anymore. What more can I say, I do not wish bad things on this establishment, I only wish good things for busniess' in East Los Angeles and for them thrive and become the best they can. Manuel's stoped striving to be the best years ago and is solely reliant on the hype and tourists word of mouth. Farewell Manuels...

I love Tepeyac!!! I can not stress that enough.  My family and I have been eating here for several years and I have never been disappointed. The flavors and quality of food have always been consistently great.  It's a staple in the community and has been feature in several TV segments for its large portions and down right yummy flavors.  Yet with all the acclaims it has received I love how it has maintained the same hole in the wall appearance and atmosphere.  The prices are reasonable and are well worth the quality and large portions. My absolute favorite there is anything with machaca (shredded beef with egg).  The machaca at Tepeyac is the best I've had and is the standard to which I compare machaca at other establishments....they never even match up. I will say that in the many years I have eaten here, I have never once actually had my meal inside.  There's always a wait to get seated.  My family and I just automatically go to the outside window.  Which is quick and easy and we usually have good luck about getting a table.  Something that they have started outside is the table service.  You still order at the window, but once you find a table and seat yourself you just hand your receipt over to the waitress/waiter and they will bring you your food, which I think is great and has helped to alleviate the normally congested window and blocked wall menu.  This is a place that has been around for over 50 years and could easily last another 50 years with the great product it is producing.

I took my wife to Manuel's Tepeyac the other day because she wanted to see the place after seeing it on t.v.  It had been a long time since I last went.  It's changed alot, the dining room, and now there is a parking lot that I don't remember ever seeing.  Anyway we pulled in to the parking lot going into the wrong way.  Sorry Manuel I didn't know, but Manuel was outside walking towards his house, and made a point of letting me know I was driving the wrong way in and the wrong way out.  Sorry again, but you don't have to yell at us.  So we went in without in effect on our dinner.  The salsa was spicey but we had to pay for the chips?????  I had a chicken quesadilla, it was big and ample.  My wife had the infamous Hollenbeck Burrito.  Of course she could not finish so she took it home.  I love leftovers, so the next day I started to eat her burrito and was startled with what I found.  There was a rock in the burrito, about twice the size of a pebble.  I was appauled.  We have eaten at this place since my dad worked for RTD in the 70's.  Manuel, just because we came in the wrong way doesn't mean to have to contiminate my food.  I can not forsee myself ever coming back or even recommending this place.  Sorry again Manuel, but customer service is a priority in my dining experience.

El Tepeyac Cafe is DEFINITELY a Los Angeles landmark.  They have HUGE burridos which happen to taste amazing!  When I was younger, I used to love the taquitos, but I have moved on to the Machaca!  On top of the delicious food, their service is fast and friendly.  Sure the wait is out the door (LITERALLY), they have the best mexican food in all of LA!

First time I ever ate at Manuel's was about 25 years ago when his son Pancho took me there. (I had never heard of El Tepeyac Cafe up to that point.) I had Huevos Rancheros and it stuck. 95 times out of 100, I'll order Huevos Rancheros. I also enjoy Kiko's Special. Quite frankly, I really like their enchiladas (with sour cream, gotta have sour cream) and their tacos. Ever since that fateful day many years ago, no other Mexican food will do, NO OTHER!

Tepeyac was delicious! Usually big ass burritos are crap rapped in a huge tortilla but not in this case :D everything about it was good. I definatly going back to try the chile verde burrito. I tried both the asada and the machaca..asada was good, have had better but I'm not complaining :D the machaca burrito was delicious! And manuel was the most friendly owner I've ever met, and I've been to vicious dogs on lankershim.. If uve been there u know what I mean lol. Over all I give it 4 stars and I recommend it! :D its been DAN-O-PROVED!

If you are in the mood for some heavy Mexican food then this is the place to eat.  However, I would recommend you take it to go because the place is small and always crowded.  The restaurant is very popular.  I had the cheese enchiladas with red sauce and rice and beans. Originally, I thought I had ordered chicken enchiladas, but read the menu carefully and it read choice of cheese, chicken, or beef.  I order jack cheese with chicken.  But the enchiladas came out with jack cheese only.  Minor misunderstanding on my part.  The plate had extremely generous portions. The cheese in the enchiladas was heavy.  I could not eat everything, although I was pretty close.  Co-workers ordered the beef taquitos with generous amounts of guacamole. We also order a chile relleno which was also very huge.  All the burritos there are huge.  You can split it with 2-3 people and still be full.  The place is family owned and the people that work there are extremely friendly.  The owner has pictures of himself and his family.  It's definitely interesting to see.  Long time ago when Manuel first started the place it use to be his home which eventually converted to a restaurant.  It's definitely a hole in the wall place.  Not for people on healthy diets.  This is good old mexican food with heavy sauces, cheeses, tons of meat, come hungry.

In a friend of mine's quest to find "all things mexican" she decided to go find this spot in East LA that she saw on Man vs Food.  I did not realize that we were meeting them @ a "hot spot".(literally it was about 100 degrees outside & a popular place)  They waited in line 45 minutes to get in this place.  Our favorite part was the owner coming outside with "apple juice" w/ a slice of lemon & salt.(they do not sell alcohol so it was a treat) After we were seated we watched the waitress serving a monstrousity of a burrito to neighboring tables.  Five people could eat off that thing or one person will have leftovers for 3 days.  I did not order that but my friend's hubby did with the intent of sharing w/ wifey.  Let's just say the after picture still looked like a WHOLE burrito was there.  I was more reserved and ordered the Hollenbeck, because Anthony Bourdain and I are kindred when it comes to ALL THINGS PORK!  It was a spectaular burrito and the salsa verde on the table was a kicker!  My hubby ordered the t-bone steak. It was tender and full of flavour. When he asked for jalapenos the owner came back with a fresh tomato, onion & jalapeno pan fried and it was the best.  We also ordered the horchata which was refreshing and not overly sweet. Recommend it?  I say venture out  to East LA and get your grub on......the owner's personality alone earns them high marks and we know why his business has lasted 54 years.

First of all, I came here with a friend and it was packed, but Manny offered us a free beer while we waited. That alone deserves 5 stars. We got a table within 5 minutes and ordered the Manuel Special. It came out about 3 minutes after we ordered and it was delicious. Too big to eat alone, but perfect for 2. Manny is a funny guy, food was great, prices are reasonable. This will definitely be a stop for me every time I'm in L.A.

I've been to Manuel's in City of Industry at least six or more time. Each time at different time of day and each time I've had horrible service. Last night was especially bad went in to order to go. No one wanted to help me. When I finally got someones help, he ignored me most of the time. Waited 45 minutes to find out he had put the order in for dine in. Well ended up leaving 1 hour 15 minutes later upset and with no desire to ever go back again. What a disappointment.

I have been eating at Manual's for over 30 years and I have to honestly say that they have the best Mexican food. I always have the Hollenbeck burrito and it is delicious. The taquitos and guacamole are yummy. Manual always greets everyone at the door and is very welcoming. Everyone my family has referred to Manual's over the years always gives it a thumbs up!  Generous portions and great prices.

Wow! This has got to be the worst mexican food I've ever had...there was absolutely no flavor! Just some red gruel poured over my enchilada that came straight from Acapulco's or something. Maybe I was expecting too much because I was starving and my co-worker was raving about this place and how the dishes were huge and delicious. Well...they were huge! The size of the burritos my co-workers ordered was absolutely monstrous! It was the size of a small pillow...yikes! Now if it was filled with what Yuca's puts in their burritos, then I could just eat it for days but this one...it not only looked unappetizing but judging by the carne in their enchilada, I would have probably given it away. As well, the place isn't even cheap...go elsewhere for cheap and delicious mexican food...just because it's in the 'hood, doesn't make it good!

super low key location across from a church & right in the middle of a working class super latino (mostly mexican as this is boyle heights) neighborhood. the tiny SUV-shunning parking lot is always full but streets parking ample & not intimidating. lines are always annoying long (think The Pantry on a sun morning) even for takeout! theres probably 20 tables & its small inside so celebrity fit club will NOT be taping an episode in here any time.. yes the manuel special burrito is $17 & yes its huge & no its not enough for 4 people as the menu suggests.. me & my bf inhaled this thing in 15 minutes... yes, we're stuffed right now, & desperately wanna nap the afternoon away but we just scarfed down a pound of mahatma rice it seems like so i'll sit on my cozy computer chair for a half hour or so till the bloating-ness leaves me.. any whooo if youre a native angeleno then you've been here.. if you just arrived from ohio and barely moved into your fountain ave/western blvd studio well come down here cuz its not the viper room & weekday auditions that will authenticate your LA status.. its a meal at El Tepeyac....

I too learned about El Tepeyac from Man vs Food and couldn't wait to try the place.  As everyone says, the burritos are huge.  We were disappointed to learn that huge burritos don't necessarily make for a good dining experience.  Parking lot is very small, but we circled around a few times and found that spots open up easily - there was also parking right on the street.  We got there about 3:30 Saturday afternoon, hoping to be there after the lunch crowd and before the dinner crowd - no such luck.  We waited for an hour outside for a table inside,  Service was good; prices are OK.  After reading so many reviews, I tried the Chile Verde Hollenbeck, daughter tried the Chile Verde Okie, husband tried the Hollenbeck Machaca - shredded beef (sans eggs ?? and cheese).  I love Chile Verde, but this was not what  I expected - Chile Verde is usually tender pork chunks in green sauce  Here it was in a tomato based sauce, and the pork chunks were TOUGH  (in both pork burritos).  The Okie was covered in thick (almost bitter) red sauce that tasted like it was from a can; it had very little meat - only a few chunks. The shredded beef burrito was very good (the waitress told us they had just made a fresh batch of machaca).  No kid's plates offered on the menu.  Guacamole was good, but expensive.  The most fun we had at El Tepeyac was watching the items coming out of the kitchen - they definitely look a lot better than they tasted!  They are opening a new location in City of Industry soon (much closer), and we might try it again ( just because so many people love the place), and hopefully based on what we learned at our first visit, we might enjoy it more.

I had to really ask myself if this was worth 5 stars AND IT IS! I'm not saying I'm a hard guy to please, but this generation of customer service has really been influenced by the all mighty dollar. Having said that  there was a point in time where people took personal pride in their work. From shining shoes to managning a department store, every American put their personal stamp on their work. Now it seems as if customer service has fallen to a cost efficent, who will do it the cheapest so we can charge more to make more way of life. But this is not that type of restaurant. Just go see the line out front. You really have to ask yourself "Can all these people be wrong?". Located in East LA its full of history. Just hope you catch Manuel when he is there. You can not only get a complimentary shot of tequilla for your wait in line, you can also get a whole bunch of cool stories about the place.  The food is awesome, and in true Mexican fashion they serve portions that could feed a light infantry platoon. Just get anything. Its all good. My personal favorite the Hollenbeck. Make sure to be hungry if you dont want to waste food. The portions could honestly feed two or three. The chili verde is a small slice of heaven. This place is like going back in time. A time when you not only got your money's worth but you felt good about the service you recieved. And only a 15 minute drive to Dodger stadium, it's always a place to get full on before a game so you don't fall victim to stadium prices. This place wont break your wallet but it might break your pride if your into eating competetions. Well worth the drive in your in the LA area.

I guess I am going against the grain here but still want to give my 2 cents.  I ordered the Hollenback with carne asada based on many reviews here.  As expected, portion was generous....it was stuffed with rice, beans, guac, meat, etc.  We also got an order of the nachos loaded with guac.  The nachos were amazing...chips were fresh and tasty...loaded with cheese and guac.  But the burrito, the must-have of the menu, was only average.  Average meaning Chipotle or the truck down the street probably make better burritors than El Tepeyac.  And for $9, it is was definitely pricey.  Other than that, the staff was friendly and really tried to make us feel comfortable.  Overall, it's worth a visit like any other touristy landmark but don't think it's worth a second visit.

this place is so damn good, on the way to la we detour just to come here for dinner. the manuel special is by far the best deal you can get. it can easily feed four people! this place IS tiny, and you will be lucky not to wait a few minutes for a table. the staff is wonderful and really nice, and when you're all done and ready to go, they come by and offer you some candy. if that aint good customer service i don't know what is. although it is situated in a dodgy neighborhood, most of the time you won't run into much trouble. i have seen people of all races waiting outside and never once seen anything dangerous. this is definitely a plus, since i have seen a lot of tourists flock here for dinner and boyle heights has always been talked about as dangerous. you don't gotta trip when you're at el tepeyac :)

I came to this joint without knowing that it had been featured on a travel show, I didnt know this until i saw the portrait outside the restaurant, prouldy claiming it had been so. I thought to myself, "excellent Im in for a treat."  I was wrong, very wrong. From my experience here, the only thing worth bragging about is that the portions are massive, but that doesnt make it good. The sauce in which my burrito was drenched in tasted like it came out from an aluminum can, this alone turned me off.  The burrito as a whole was a dissapointment, looks can be deceiving and I would not eat here again.

I went there because my friend had family near by. When I got there I realized it was featured on Man Vs Food. It seems like the wait could be long for some people. Me and my buddy had about 12 people ahead of us, but we went to the front of line when two counter seats opened up since all other parties were three or more. FYI I would not go there with a large group.  When I was leaving, the line had tripled. This is because restaurant capacity is about 35.  Owner Manuel sat us at the bar and immediately asked me if I wanted a beer.  I asked what kind he had, he just replied, "it's free." I liked the place already.  BTW, I recommend sitting at the counter. Faster service and better experience. Half the customers there were regulars which is always a good sign. Portions are large! I finished about half of normal size burrito.  And that was after the beer and a toke.  They do have larger burritos for the brave.  Taste was excellent. I would definitely be a regular if I was local. To sum it up beautiful women, great food, and awesome old man.

My wife and I ordered the Hollenbeck de Asada.  It's pretty solid, nothing great though.  I don't understand why so many Mexican places in LA don't season their meat.  It makes the food taste more bland.  The burrito has the potential to be awesome with more seasoning.  It's easily big enough for two people to get really full.  The guac, chips & salsa were good (not the red/hot salsa).  If you're in the area, it's worth stopping by, but I don't think it's worth going way out of your way for it.  The owner is awesome!  It's definitely worth going to at least once.

I saw the man vs food episode and had this place at the top of my hit list.  I make a special trip to come here and there's a line out the door (a really good sign).  I finally get my burrito and it was so damn weak i couldn't believe it.  I had a smile ear to ear when I got it, tasted it and felt like crying.  Chicken was way overcooked, super chewy and had no flavor.  Guacamole was garbage......flavorless green mush (needs salt at least), the beans were like brown/gray paste with absolutely no flavor or texture, rice was overcooked, crunchy and flavorless as well.  Only thing that made it somewhat edible was the sauce on top.  I ate about 1/2 of it, picked it apart with my fork and threw the rest away.  My girl had a taco and an enchilada.  The enchilada sauce was pretty good but the meat was the same (overcooked and flavorless).  If you like real, good mexican food, dont come here.  If you like huge quantities of overcooked mush then by all means, have a go.  Extremely large quantities of food do not make the food taste any better.  Small amount of crappy food is the same as a large amount of crappy food.  You just get more crap.  Ending on somewhat of a high note, the Horchata is awesome!

This place was sooo good. The portions are huge and the dinning room small but it is well worth the wait. I visited there after seeing the place on a TV show from Food Network. You have to check it out at least once.

I chose this place as my first review since I currently moved to the LA area and am in love with this place!!! First let's start out with the fact that I live 30 miles away and do not hesitate driving this distance with bumper to bumper traffic. First time I went I had the Carne Asada Okie....Oh my god!! Soooo good!! The burrito was very tasty which I was surprised since most places with a burrito this big end up tasting like crap. The guacamole was very tasty and the meat was just right. Can it be any cheaper? No way!! $9 for a burrito that makes a  Chipotle burrito look like a rolled taco...Can't go wrong. With all this being said there is something that I love even more from there...Their Chilaquiles are amazing!! Haven't found better anywhere!!! Huge portion and two eggs on top and so crispy. Okay so all in all this place is worth every penny. I would even pay double the price for their food. It's that good!! Go NOW!!

My friend told me that we were going here to eat a child to which I cringed because I am a children's social worker and that would be considered MAD abuse! What he meant was the child-SIZED burrito... I told him to stop saying that or I would have to report him to children's services. Anywho, this place has huge @$$ burritos. We ordered at the window and then it got cold so scurried inside. It was pretty packed, and people were enjoying their food very much. So this child sized burrito was $20 and could feed about five hungry people. I ate 1/6 of it and was full and could feel all the NaCl flowing through my veins like the way blood flowed down Luke Wilson's wrists  in The Royal Tenenbaums. Ugh, not sure why that image is in my head. Anyhow. The food is good. It's piled with cheese, guac, tomatoes, sour cream, rice, beans, and the meaty goodness. They were really busy, but it's busy for a reason. Next time I'd probably order something smaller though....something the size of a chick, not a child.

This place has the biggest burrito ever!!!! OMG!!! the burrito was bigger than my head! hahaha!!! when the bf and i first got to the restaurant (which was around 11 AM) there was already a line that was formed outside for people waiting to be seated inside the restaurant...some people didn't feel like waiting so they went to the the take out line which was on the side of the building...while waiting, Manuel (the owner) was greeting and conversing with his customers...he was even sweet enough to get a chair for an elderly lady so she wouldn't get tired of standing...once seating inside we decided to order the manuel special since we read other yelpers reviews on it and it was also shown on the tv show man vs food...once our food was brought to our table we couldn't believe how huge it was...other fellow eaters at the restaurant even took pictures of our burrito cause they have never seen anything like it before....supposedly the burrito could feed 2-4 people, but the bf and i only ate 1/8 of the thing...hahaha!!! we ended up having a huge take out box just for it....i would recommend people to come here and get the manuel special if they are with a huge group....maybe like 4-8 people...hehehe....the taste of the burrito is good as well....if u do go by urself and order the manuel special, just make sure u come very very VERY hungry...hehe =D

ever since the location off of paramount closed down , ive been pretty depressed... but little did i know that the original El Tepeyac was not too far away!!! my boyfriend and i came here on a saturday night around 5 pm thinking we would beat the dinner rush but as soon as we pulled up, there was a pretty insane line (noooooo!!!) It honestly felt like we were in those christmas movies where we were standing outside in the freezing cold while looking inside at the warm, happy people indulging into hot chocolate by the fireplace.. except that the hot chocolate is substituted with a mouthwatering burrito! we were starving but i told him that everything would be okay and it would be worth the wait! haha~  after about 30 minutes in line, the owner? said there was a booth available and we did not hesitate for one second to take the offer. We were seated and the server took our order right away. The only thing that I noticed was different from the other location is that this spot doesnt give you chips and salsa :( oh well~ but we ordered the hollenback burrito and chicken taquitos and it honestly felt like.. HEAVEN!!! oh man... it seriously felt as if we just ate at an all you can eat buffet and at the end there was still a massive amount of food left over. This would honestly be my favorite wet burrito spot for sure!! The only complaint I have about El Tepeyac, is that I didnt wear bigger pants! =P We are definitely going to come back soon and try to conquer the Manuel special *gasp*

I've been going here since I was a kid since I used to live down the street from this place.  The parking lot is small but there is always plenty of street parking unless church is going on across the street.  The line out front is their seating system if you want a table or you can sit at the bar if it's open.  They only take cash, which is old school, but that has always been the case.  Any plate you get is always a pretty good helping of yumminess.  As other reviewers talked about, they have the Manuel's special that feeds at least 4-6 very hungry people.  They do have a smaller version called the Hollenback burrito which is just the same.  The taquitos are bathed in guacamole.  Their machaca is delicious.  Actually, pretty much anything you get is pretty good and pretty easy on your wallet.  I love it!  I just miss those damn shots of tequila or whisky in my coffee courtesy of Manuel.

my friend and i woke up hungry today. he told me this place has awesome breakfast and he's been going there with his parents for ages. i'm being very serious when i say that i trust this guy's folks. ok enough about me, i've got two words for you : BREAKFAST BURRITO. this thing comes out and i can't help but make a face like "this thing is going to kill me!" and it did but it was worth it. eggs, re-fried beans, bacon and potatoes - very simple but there's definitely something special going on here. obviously a knife & forker as the beans were spilling out the underside of it, as if to send the message "don't even bother trying to pick this thing up, brave one". they had excellent chips and salsa, which i'd call a must with what i got, but that's me. the service was quick and cheerful and the owner made his way around the place, saying hi and shaking hands. i'll be going back soon with my girlfriend, to try and tackle that 5 pounder i keep hearing about.

We had seen this place featured on "Man vs. Food" on the Travel Channel and were anxious to try it after a Dodgers game.  This is one of those places where there is always a line waiting to get in.  Our friends ordered their favorite, the renowned Hollenbeck burrito, to share (they chose the chile verde pork which is what I'll order next time!)  plus an order of taquitos (2) with guacamole.   They were only able to finish half of the burrito and took the rest home. My husband and I shared an order of guacamole and chips and we each chose a combo plate with chicken and beef enchiladas.  The portions were "ginormous," piping hot and very good, and the prices were really cheap.  The service here is friendly and efficient.  It would have been nice to have a Corona or a margarita but they don't serve alcohol; however, their iced tea was very good.   As we often do when we find a place we really like, my husband and I each bought one of their colorful tee shirts.  We'll definitely return here on another trip to L.A.

probably the best place to eat a authentic mexican burrito, packed with lots of ingredients and the portion of the burrito is massive! mom and pop shops are the best you can eat!
